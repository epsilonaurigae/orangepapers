Subject: It's_Impossible_to_Explain<br>
<p>
As someone who has read every word on this site, from it's 
beginning, and has a personal library of data concerning alcoholism, 
that exceeds agent orange's library collection here on the internet, I 
am still amazed about the gift of sobriety.  Good ole' agent orange, 
performing intellectual backflips, trying to scientifically map out the 
pathway to sobriety, has admitted, in his own words, that he too is 
confused of why he is sober today.
<p>
Raving lunatic wanna-be agent orange, has no more clue as to why he 
made the &quot;decision&quot; to quit drinking than the man in the moon. It takes 
not a genius in understanding the pain versus pleasure concepts of 
sobriety.  Except for the fact, that our secret agent orange also does 
not have a clue of why 100,000 plus humanoids drink themselves to death 
each year, he admits that too in his own words.
<p>
I have not the slightest idea of what brings on sobriety, or what 
brought sobriety to me 14 years ago.  Something clicked, somehow, 
something clicked, that allowed alcoholics like me, to have the ability 
to even contemplate a serious decision.  And we are sober today. It blew 
my mind then because I remember the moment.  I remember it well.  And it 
continues to blow my mind today.
<p>
And our agent orange has said the same thing in his own words.




<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again Tom,
<p>
Apparently, you aren't feeling so good today. I notice that you regularly cycle
between rationality and irrational anger. I hope you feel better soon.
<p>
You seem to be misunderstanding some of the things that I wrote. I am not at all
puzzled by my sobriety. It's very simple: I am sober because I don't drink alcohol.
Period. None whatsoever. And that makes you get sober within a few days.
(Then recovering from the damage that alcohol caused takes longer.)
<p>
I'm also not puzzled by why 100,000 people drink themselves to death. There are many
causes, ranging from
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">damage inflicted upon them in childhood</a> to 
mental illness (especially depression, bipolar disorder and narcissistic personality disorder)
 to bad environments (like wars and slums) driving people to drink.
Then there are the veterans with PTSD who drink to forget.
Then there are people who have genetic disorders. There are people who are in physical pain,
and they are trying to blank it out.
There are people who are in existential crises who don't think that life is worth living.
There are even people who drink to kill the pain from too much drinking and too much smoking.
There are a zillion causes, and they are actually pretty easy to understand.

<p>
I did write that I was puzzled by how I changed my mind. That is something else.
Before I quit, in the last year of drinking,
I had been very depressed and feeling like there was no sense in trying to quit
drinking and smoking, even though it was killing me,
and improve my health, beause I would just fail and relapse again.
Why bother when it isn't going to work?
Essentially, I really believed the A.A. and N.A. stuff about being powerless over alcohol,
or powerless over our addictions (tobacco). I thought I was just doomed to that fate.
So might as well just stay stoned and kill the pain until the bitter end comes.
<p>
Then, one day, I just suddenly snapped and decided that I wasn't going to die that way.
I became totally determined to get sober and stay sober.
Somehow, I just knew that I could do it. And I did.
And that was 13 years ago and I still haven't had a drink or a cigarette since.
<p>
Now I understand some of the causes for the change: I became terribly sick and couldn't work
and had the utilities turned off and then got evicted.  And out on the streets I had time
to see that the drinking lifestyle wasn't working.
<p>
Then, I went to a free clinic and the doctor immediately recognized me as an alcoholic,
even though I was not drunk or stinking of alcohol. (I had just bathed.)
The doctor saw <i>Spider Angiomas</i> in my skin. Those are discolorations caused by
blood vessels breaking down and leaking blood into the skin. The doctor also did a simple
test: pinch a fold of skin on my arm, and watch how long it takes for the white fingerprint
to disappear. The skin was like thin, wet leather, and it took a full minute for the fingerprint
to slowly fade out.  And the skin flattened back out very slowly. 
The doctor tried to show me that my blood circulation was really bad.
I didn't understand how bad it was, or what healthy skin was supposed to act like.
It was a few years later, after quitting, that I remembered that test while I was answering
another letter to the Orange Papers. I repeated the test. I almost couldn't do it: The skin
was thick and rubbery and didn't even want to get folded into a flat pinch. I had to really
grab a thick fold of the skin and pinch hard, and the skin popped back to normal instantly.
There wasn't even a white fingerprint. I couldn't believe it, so I tried the test again and again.
I discovered that if I pinched really hard and then pulled my fingers away really fast, I
could just see the fingerprint fading out. It disappeared in like a quarter of a second.
Now that is blood circulation.
<p>
The implications of that are staggering. When I was sick, that poor blood circulation was not
just in the skin &#8212; it was everywhere &#8212; in the heart and lungs and liver and brain and kidneys and
muscles and intestines, and everywhere. The skin is just revealing what is going on inside, where you can't 
see it. No wonder the doctor was telling me that it was very close to the end.
<p>
After the doctor examined me and questioned me in another appointment,
he announced, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one. Now I'm not going
to waste my time repeating myself. I've told you how things are. You are a big boy now.
Go do whatever you are going to do.&quot;
<p>
I went and got another case of beer and thought about it. And drank and thought some more.
And some more.  Then, a month later, I quit forever.
<p>
Still, it is a bit of puzzle that I just changed my mind about dying so suddenly and completely.
And I changed my mind about my abilities so completely. I suddenly knew that I had
the power to quit, and I had the determination to do it, and there wasn't any question
about it.
<p>
If I could figure out what that mental technique or mindpower is,
I could package it and sell it and make a million.
But I don't know what the magic is exactly, so I can't.
<p>
But that doesn't mean that I don't have some good ideas about how to quit. Once again, there is
this letter:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: What's Not Good About A.A<br>
<p>

Your paper on AA I am sorry to say is very sad.   You are obviously a very
smart person so I am confused how you can view a program that has saved
millions of lives so poorly.  All of the numbers and stats you used are
valid one main point you left out if the people you say that came to aa and
died because of it what would have happened to them anyway.  No one knows
but based on the dozens of people I know that never have found AA never
will because I watched them die.  Use your stats and smarts to help and or
give back if AA is not the way then what is it?

<p>
You are obviously not and alcoholic if you were you might see your stats a
bit differently.  Your study of the program you did was done to prove AA
wrong.  I will not be able to fight your arguments you are a sound writer
and very very well spoken.  All I know for sure is AA and the people there
saved my life.  I guess I am just one of the lucky ones well that is me and
everyone I know that works it!  Could'nt help it either...

Hello Patrick,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Wow. What a stream of untrue A.A. slogans.

<p>
<ol>

<li>
A.A. has not saved millions. We have discussed this again and again. The often-repeated A.A.
claim that they have saved millions is a lie. Period. A deliberate bare-faced lie.
A.A. does not even have 2 million members in the whole world, and most of the members are
not sober for very long.
<p>
Bill Wilson started lying about the A.A. success rate back in the nineteen-thirties and they never
stopped. You can start by reading about that here: 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">The historical A.A. failure rate</a>.

<p><li> 
The success rate of people who quit on their own is the same as the success rate of people who
go to A.A., so we can easily figure out what would have happened if people had not gone to A.A.

<p><li> 
You imply that there must be &quot;a way&quot;:
<font color="black">
  &quot;...if AA is not the way then what is it?&quot;
</font>
<br>
The idea that there must be &quot;a way&quot; or &quot;a program&quot; to quit drinking is another of the false ideas
that A.A. spreads.  The vast majority of people who successfully quit drinking do it on their
own without any A.A. or "support group" or "program".

<p><li> 
A.A. did not save your life. If you quit drinking, then you saved your own life.
Nobody holds your hand every Friday and Saturday night but you.
All that A.A. does is steal the credit from the people who get it together and quit drinking,
while disavowing any responsibility for the ones who don't quit.

<p><li> 
Adolf Hitler? Oh yes. That is the real history of A.A.  While the Oxford Group cult leader
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman was going to Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and <i>Sieg-Heil!</i>-ing
Adolf Hitler, Bill Wilson, Doctor Bob and Clarence Snyder didn't have a word of complaint
against the Nazi connection. They just kept on recruiting more alcoholics for Frank's Oxford Group.
And when Buchman came back from the 1936 Berlin Olympics where he had been the personal guest
of the Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler, and thanked Heaven for giving us Adolf Hitler,
neither Bill Wilson nor Dr. Bob nor Clarence Snyder quit the Oxford Group in protest.
They all just kept on recruiting and telling alcoholics that Frank's religion was the cure
for alcoholism.
<p>
You can read much more about that here:
 <a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">Partying with the Nazi Party</a>.
<p>
In addition, you should notice the similarity between the Nazi philosophy and the A.A. philosophy.
Both claim that the average man cannot think for himself and he should just follow the orders of
his superior, no matter whether the superior is an S.S. Captain or an A.A. sponsor.
And the average person is really a disgusting <i>Untermenschen</i>.
Some relevant A.A. slogans are:
<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li> &quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stop your stinkin' thinkin'.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stinkin' thinkin' leads to stinkin' drinkin'!&quot;
<li> &quot;Your thinking is alcoholic.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't drink, don't think, and go to meetings.
<li> &quot;When we think we are in control of our own lives we are living in denial.&quot;
<li> &quot;I know I'm in trouble when I start thinking I can run my own life.&quot;
<li> &quot;Call Your Sponsor Before, Not After, You Take The First Drink.&quot;
<li> &quot;When all else fails, listen to your sponsor.&quot;
<li> &quot;When all else fails, follow directions.&quot;
<li> &quot;My sponsor says I'm trying. Very trying.&quot;
<li> &quot;Unless each AA member follows to the best of his ability our suggested Twelve Steps of recovery, he almost certainly signs his own death warrant. <font color="#9F0000"><b>We must obey</b></font> certain principles or we die.&quot; <font size="-1">(<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 174.)</font>
<li> &quot;You are not required to like it, you're only required to DO it.&quot;
</ul>
</font>

<p>
Most all fascisms are health and purity movements.  Hitler was really big on getting the youths outdoors
and getting them exercise and getting them into shape (into shape for the Army, that is).
Hitler was the first major world leader to campaign against tobacco.
And the Nazi leaders frowned on heavy drinking.
<a href="orange-letters120.html#Dachau" target="_blank">Heinrich Himmler sent soldiers to the Dachau
concentration camp for alcohol abuse</a>.
<p>
For more on the Nazi health and purity movement aspect, look
<a href="orange-Diener-postings.html#purity1" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-Diener-postings.html#purity2" target="_blank">especially here</a> and
<a href="orange-Diener-postings.html#purity3" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
And A.A. is obviously a health and purity movement, and A.A. even defines spiritual rank
by how long a person has refrained from drinking alcohol.
(Not by whether the oldtimer has abused a newcomer or thirteenth-stepped a newcomer girl recently. Nope.
Only sober time counts for spiritual rank.)

<p>
Also read:
<a href="orange-Diener-Oxford-1930.html#Peter_Howard" target="_blank">Paul Diener,
the Ph.D. historian, wrote</a>: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The origins of AA lie in the Oxford Group. And, at Oxford
in the 1930s, the Oxford Groupers were all mixed up in the fascist movement.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And <a href="orange-rroot480.html#Diener_letter">Paul Diener also wrote that 
fascism</a> always had a purity element to it, espousing something like &quot;Clean Minds
and Clean Bodies&quot;. Specifically, he said:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
All protofascisms and fascisms shared, it seems, two
characteristics: 1) they were all quasireligious,
'spiritual' movements, and, 2) they were all 'health and
medicine' movements, which blended ideas of bodily purity
with radical-reactionary politics.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And he might have mentioned that fascisms seem to always flaunt
an angry, arrogant, brutish attitude, too. And they seem to always complain
that &quot;their enemies&quot; attacked them, so they have the right to fight back.
(Bill Wilson routinely cried in his beer about how badly those poor alcoholics got treated
by people who didn't understand alcoholism.)
And fascisms are strongly anti-intellectual, just like A.A. is.
<p>
Yes, A.A. learned a lot from the fascist Oxford Group.

Everything that the birds could eat is buried under snow, so they are really hungry today.
They sat in the trees and twittered with joy when I came outside and sprinkled birdseed around.
They knew exactly what I was doing, and they immediately jumped on the seed. I mean, it wasn't even
two minutes from the time that I turned my back on the seed and walked away that they flew down
and started hungrily gobbling up the seeds.
And they were reluctant to leave the food. Ordinarily, if I come near with a camera, they are quick to fly
up into the trees. Not now. They hung on and gobbled more seed as long as they could.
And they were quick to return as soon as they felt it was reasonably safe. They are really hungry.

The first bunch of seed that I put out sank quickly, and also got covered by more snow. It snowed all

<p>
&quot;AA is brainwashing&quot;, I said. &quot;Well, your brain needs washing&quot;, they
said. It is a very difficult thing to do, to replace one habit with
another for any considerable period of time. When the baby cries,
because you took away his plaything (that cute little copperhead snake),
you have to replace it with a rattle ( a play rattle &#8212; not another
snake) or some other distraction or the kid will scream and scream. AA
is a replacement therapy, based on behavioral modification. It may seem
like a witch doctor's remedy to you, but &quot;it does work &#8212; it really

your data seems impeccable &#8212; but your presentation my be upsetting for

Hello Walter,
<p>
You are basing your argument on several false assumptions:

<p>
<ol>

<li> A.A. is not a messenger. It is a fraud that passes off an old cult religion as a cure for
alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
<p>
<li> Brainwashing is not a joking matter. And yes, A.A. really does brainwashing.
Look at
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">
 Dr. Robert Jay Lifton's Eight Conditions of Thought Reform</a> (brainwashing).
He wrote those up after studying how Communist Chinese brainwashing worked on American
prisoners of war in Korea.
Notice how the 12 Steps and A.A. meetings incorporate all eight of Dr. Lifton's criteria.
<p>
That is much more than a coincidence. Dr. Frank Buchman was the founder of the Oxford Group
cult religion, which is where Bill Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith, and Clarence Snyder got their
religious training and learned how to use
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Buchman's conversion techniques</a>
 on people.
Well, Dr. Buchman also went to China as a missionary in the late nineteen-teens and early
nineteen-twenties and taught the Chinese his mind-bending methods of conversion.
The local Communists learned from Dr. Buchman how to change people's minds and convert
them to the Communist religion. So both the Chinese Communists and Alcoholics Anonymous
got their mind-bending conversion techniques from the same man.

<p><li> You don't need brainwashing, and your brain doesn't need &quot;a good washing.&quot;
That is a standard cultish put-down. It's in the Cult Test several times:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong" target="_blank">2. You are always wrong.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">33. Newcomers can't think right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_confessions" target="_blank">36. Confession Sessions.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_no_respect" target="_blank">51. Members Get No Respect. They Get Abused.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_dispensed_truth" target="_blank">60. Dispensed truth and social definition of reality</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_obliterate_self" target="_blank">66. Calls to Obliterate Self</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">67. Don't Trust Your Own Mind.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">68. Don't Feel Your Own Feelings.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_new_identity" target="_blank">75. New Identity &#8212; Redefinition of Self &#8212; Revision of Personal History</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">90. Newcomers Need Fixing.</a>
</ul>

<p>
<li> People do not need a pacifier or a toy or a substitute addiction to replace a
bad consumption habit.  You just quit drinking alcohol and that is that.
Or you just quit smoking and that is that.
Or you quit both and go play in the sunshine because you feel so good.

<p><li>
A.A. does not work. We've gone over this again and again. Nearly every A.A. defender and promoter
parrots the lines about &quot;millions saved.&quot; There is no truth to it, and never has been.
Look here:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">The historical A.A. failure rate</a>.

<p>
For more evidence about the A.A. failure rate, also look at 
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">A.A. sobriety medallions given out</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">a spreadsheet from the Foxhall Group in Omaha, NB</a>.

<p><li>
You think that
<font color="black">
&quot;All people need something to believe in and a purpose in life&quot;</font>?<br>
Well then, by all means, give them something true.
Feeding people a pack of lies to believe in hurts them a lot.
Just ask any cult survivor.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
How wonderful was it for Marshall Herff Applewhite to give people
something to believe in? He was the leader of the Heaven's Gate cult where they all committed
suicide, believing that they were going to hitch a ride on an invisible flying saucer that
was hiding behind the Hale-Bopp Comet, and go to Heaven. Oh yeh, something to believe in.

<p> <li>
How wonderful was it for Rev. Jim Jones to give people something to believe in?
They all committed suicide too. (914 of them.) Just for him. They believed in him.
They believed that he was a Messiah with magical healing powers.

<p> <li>
And then Vernon Howell (aka &quot;David Koresh&quot;, the Wacko from Waco)
gave his followers something to believe in, and they all died for him.
They believed that he was the Son of God.

<p> <li>
And Luc Jouret and Di Mambro founded the &quot;Solar Temple&quot; and gave people something to believe
in. They believed that they should all commit suicide for the Summer Solstice.

<p> <li>
And how wonderful is it for Alcoholics Anonymous to tell people that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the practices of an old cult religion
from the nineteen-thirties</a>
are the best cure for alcohol addiction?
How good is it to tell sick people that they are powerless over alcohol and cannot
quit on their own and they are insane and they must attend A.A. meetings
for the rest of their lives? And you are just a digusting sinner who is full of defects of
character and moral shortcomings? And you are selfish and self-seeking and
always want your own way. And you must spend the rest of your life confessing
how bad you are. Wonderful, yes? <i>NOT!</i>
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">It actually drives people to suicide</a>.
</ul>

<p><li>
You complained:
<font color="black">
&quot;your presentation my be upsetting for
some of the most sick and vulnerable people on the planet.&quot;</font><br>
Nonsense. I get lots of letters from people who tell me that they felt a huge relief when
they read my papers and found that I was voicing their own doubts.
They realized that they weren't crazy, that they had been right all along.
Many people have written and told me that I saved their lives by telling them the truth.
I explain to them that they saved their own lives, but if I was able to help in some way, then good.
<p>
Since those people are so sick and vulnerable, why not tell them the truth about everything?
You would be doing them a favor.
<p>
By the way, your complaint is just a variation on the old A.A. accusation that &quot;you are doing a great
disservice to alcoholics who are seeking sobriety.&quot;
I have a long list of such repetitions of the standard party line, here:
<a href="orange-disservice.html" target="_blank">Accusations that telling the truth about A.A. is killing alcoholics</a>.

<p><li>
Then you accused,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Is it really your purpose to perhaps harm others for the sake of an entertaining
expose' of one of the world's largest organizations (an organization at
the root of modern recovery)?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Telling people the truth is not harming them. It is doing them a favor. A.A. should be ashamed
of itself for
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">telling so many lies</a>
for so many years.  Lying to sick people about what will heal them is a despicable crime,
not a wonderful spiritual act of generosity. A.A. is a toxic witches' brew of old
cult religion, not a cure for a disease.
<p>
And again, A.A. is not a big successful recovery organization. It is a failure. And it
isn't big either. It is shrinking every year now. People are wising up and learning what A.A.
really is, and leaving it.  Or they just never join it in the first place now.
<p>
The real A.A. membership is so small now that there are maybe a few hundred thousand permanent members
in the USA, and the rest is just churn &#8212; another hundred thousand forced in by
coercive recruiting, and then another hundred thousand leave.
You can read all about the A.A. churn rate and dropout rate here:

BLOG NOTE: 2014.02.06:
<p>
I stumbled across this image while sorting old pictures. Somebody sent it to me way back when,
but I don't remember when or who. I find it highly relevant to Alcoholics Anonymous:

</center>
<p>
A.A. hits on three quarters of them:

<ol>
<p><li> Testimonials. Oh yes, the <i>Big Book</i> reprints dozens of old-timers'
stories and they all swear that A.A is great.

<p><li> &quot;Helps Your Body&quot;: Yes, the 12 Steps help your body to get rid
of alcoholism and addictions and resentments and old unconfessed sins and moral
shortcomings, and all kinds of defects of character. (But they don't help your
body to quit smoking. Funny about that.)

<p><li> Celebrity Doctor: Yes, Dr. William D. Silkworth, and Dr. Harry Tiebout,
and Dr. George E. Vaillant, and various newer incompetent fools and madmen.

<p><li> Ancient Wisdom: Oh yes, A.A. is merely the &quot;Perennial Wisdom&quot;,
common to most denominations, recycled one more time. A.A. dogma is just traditional
old religion, handed down to us through a chain of transmission that included
Dr. Frank Buchman, Rev. Sam Shoemaker, and Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith,
At least, that is what Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>.
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 17.</font>

<p><li> &quot;Buy My Book&quot;. Yes, really. Go buy the <i>Big Book</i>, and
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, and <i>PASS IT ON</i>, and <i>As Bill
Sees It</i>, and <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, and <i>Daily Reflections</i>,
and many more.

<p><li> Miracle Cure-All. Oh yes.
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#group_list" target="_blank">The 12 Steps will supposedly heal anything</a>
from alcohol abuse to drug addiction to
compulsive gambling to nicotine addiction to over-eating to sexual addiction
to being the child of an alcoholic to having just rubbed against an alcoholic a
few times too many. Or at least, that's what they say. Funny how many 12-Step
group members still smoke themselves to death. And drink themselves to death.
And die from drug overdoses.
<p>
And A.A. just loves to use the word &quot;Miracle&quot;. Every recovery is a &quot;miracle&quot;.
A.A. members meet at the &quot;Miracles Club&quot;. Bill Wilson bragged,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are convinced that a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful
health restorative. We, who have recovered from serious drinking, are miracles
of mental health.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,

</blockquote>
<p>
(Actually,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was a raving lunatic</a>,
not a miracle of mental health.)
<p>
And A.A. promoters love to brag that A.A. is &quot;holistic&quot;, too: 
<ul> 
<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Dr. Whitfield says...

the scientific approach, and not both.&quot;<br>

<p><li> &quot;Doctor&quot;: Actually, in A.A. they are called &quot;Sponsor&quot;

prescribe or proscribe medications and treatments, and they basically know how
to save your life. They know much more than doctors, even though they never went
to medical school.

<p><li> &quot;Natural&quot;: A.A. also claims that it harnesses &quot;natural healing principles.&quot;

<p><li> &quot;Toxins&quot;: In A.A., the &quot;toxins&quot; are resentments and
doubts and bad thoughts and anger and stinkin' thinkin' and lack of faith. And medications
are also toxins. But cigarettes aren't.

<p><li> &quot;Energy&quot;: Same thing. Lack of faith is lack of energy.
Lack of sobriety is lack of energy. Lack of spirituality is lack of energy.
Lack of enthusiasm for &quot;working a strong program&quot; is a lack of energy.
Lack of energy comes from not doing the 12 Steps right.

<p><li> Hostility to Criticism: <i>BINGO!!!</i>  This is the 1st Prize winner.
Oh are they hostile to criticism.  A.A. has zero tolerance for criticism or
logical analysis of what the Steps really do, or what A.A. really does to people.
A.A. will not talk honestly about sexual predators in A.A., or crazies acting as
abusive sponsors and counselors. A.A. won't tell the truth about its real history
or explain how the practices of an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the
nineteen-thirties could heal alcohol addiction or mental illness.
A.A. will not even discuss how &quot;the program&quot;
could be updated and improved. And A.A. will not consider protecting teenagers from
the hard-core criminals and sexual perverts and rapists who are sentenced to A.A. by
misguided judges.

<p><li> Western Medicine: A.A. supposedly knows more about alcoholism than all of
the doctors and psychiatrists and ministers and priests in the world.
They say that A.A. has magic that is much better than stupid Western Medicine.

Subject: 12 things<br>
<p>

I am sorry you are so obsessed.  People are responsible for their own 
fates. The Big Book may have been written a long time ago but so have 
several books on philosophy etc. There are at least 50 meetings a day in 
my small area, all with different flavors. There are crazy people in 
every organization including our government. Just don't go to 
crazy meetings. Seems simple. Take what you want and leave the rest is 
what I've always heard. There is a lot I leave. I'm not 
sure the point of all the AA bashing lately. There are many ways people 
come to sobriety. Everyone has to find their own way. No one has ever 
solicited me or told me I would be damned if I did not go to AA 
meetings. This anger always seems to come from people who have not been 
there or had a problem with someone telling them something they did not 
like. Walk away and do something positive for goodness sakes. Just 
don't get all this crazy. No problems without alcohol for me. 
Way cheaper and wonderful women at the women's meetings.

Hello Cindy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm not obsessed. The people who are obsessed are the ones
who go to one, two, or three A.A. meetings a day for many years. Now that's obsessed.

<p>
You say,
<font color="BLACK">
 &quot;Just don't go to the crazy meetings.&quot;</font><br>
 How is a cloudy-headed newly-detoxed confused
newcomer supposed to know which meetings are crazy? When you see a newcomer
woman, do you immediately go to her and give her the brochure that is
the secret guide to A.A. meetings that tells
her which meetings are frequented by the sexual predators and perverts and pedophiles
and rapists? 
And which meetings get the criminals who were sentenced to A.A. meetings by a judge
or parole officer?
And which oldtimers are terrible sponsors?
And which will steal your money?
<p>
If you don't tell her that, how is she supposed to know?
<p>
And you DO publish such a guide, don't you? If not, why not?
Don't you believe in helping the newcomers?

<p>
And saying that the young women should just go to the women-only meetings is not
any answer for young men who will be the target of homosexual predators and
dope dealers and slave collectors and fundamentalist <i>Big Book</i> thumpers.

<p>
The rest of your letter is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">minimization and denial</a>,
something that Bill Wilson
said alcoholics were very good at. And you are using the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">escape via relativism trick</a>:
<font color="BLACK">&quot;There are many ways people
come to sobriety. Everyone has to find their own way.&quot;</font><br>
That is of course just so much nonsense when the A.A. fundamentalists insist that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="_blank">the 12 Steps are &quot;the way&quot;, and the only way</a>.
They do not say that you should find
your own way. They say that you must do it &quot;the one and only way that works.&quot;

<p>
And the big important fact that you are ignoring is that A.A. just does not work.
Period.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
The A.A. recovery rate is no better than going it alone and quitting on your own.</a>
Old cult religion does not cure addiction problems.
<p>
Have a good day now.

From: Tom M.<br>
Subject: Philip Seymour Hoffman<br>
<p>
Philip Seymour Hoffman dies from an overdose. He had been sober in AA for 23 years,
and relapsed in 2012. I think a relapse after long-term membership in AA is
especially dangerous for two main reasons.

<p>
1)	Being a long-term member usually confers &quot;guru&quot; status on people. Long term members are the elite members of AA, the all-wise, all-seeing, infallible priest class. When one of these members relapses, it can be very difficult to stop using drugs, because not only is all that clean-time gone in a puff of smoke, but the member may want to keep using rather than start all over again, eat a dose of humble pie, and have to face up to being viewed as a failure. The member is always to blame for a relapse, never AA or its infallible program. AA's program never fails anyone, people only fail the AA program, don't you know.

<p>
2)	After 23 years of being brainwashed by AA's dogma of powerlessness and addiction as a disease, the addict is in a state of learned helplessness. They believe wholeheartedly that one drink or one dose of drugs will lead to a full-blown relapse over which they have no control, which will inevitably lead to their death. This all-or-nothing approach to addiction is a self-fulfilling prophesy and does far more harm than good. It is self-defeating.

<p>
I now believe that the teachings and beliefs of AA kill far more addicts than they save.

<p>

Hello Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I can only agree. Like totally agree. Yes, I can see how
some relapsed people just would not return to the A.A. meeting and admit that they had
lost all of their <i>Time</i> and accept a beginner's coin, and
start all over again as a &quot;baby&quot;.  The humiliation is too much.
<p>
Teaching people that they are powerless over their addictions is a formula for disaster.
If I were really powerless over alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, I would be dead.
And if I believed that I was powerless, I would not have succeeded in quitting.

<p>
I also believe that A.A. kills more people than it saves. Remember that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. George E. Vaillant
 studied and tested A.A.</a>,
and after 8 years of A.A.-based treatment, the score with
his first 100 A.A.-treated patients was: 5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66 still
drinking. Dr. Vaillant accurately called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.

<p>
I also notice that the publicity about Philip Seymour Hoffman focusses
on &quot;how terrible this disease is.&quot;
None of the A.A. promoters or defenders
asked why all those years of A.A. participation didn't save Hoffman's life.

<p>
Well why didn't it?  What good is A.A. if you are still going to die like that?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

You can ride a bicycle on that if you stay on the hard-packed snow.
<p>
I went to the library to check my email, but the library was closed because of the weather.
So I went over to the feed store to get more birdseed. The guy there asked if I was on
my bike. When I told him &quot;yes&quot;, he said, &quot;You're crazy.&quot;
I said, &quot;You do what you have to do. I have a whole lot of hungry
little birds and they are hoping that I will give them something to eat.
They twitter so happily when I sprinkle out some more birdseed for them.&quot;
<p>
I managed to get a 40-pound bag of
birdseed home by balancing it on the handlebars. I had to push the bike up one hill
for a block because I couldn't downshift because the shifter was frozen. I think it
got some water in it, which became solid ice.  The bag of birdseed and I made
it home anyway, in spite of the hassles. (It's good exercise. Saves on gym fees.)

The bird feeders and a hungry bird
</center>
See the bird in the tree right above the left-hand feeder? He is just waiting
for me to go away so that he feels safe eating from the feeder. He and his friends
watched as I took the feeders down and refilled them, and hung them back up.
They clearly understood what I was doing.
Then he flew down onto that branch just above the feeder. He just wants me to
be a little further away and stop staring at him and stop pointing a camera
at him before he starts eating.
He isn't terribly afraid of me, but he isn't tame either. 
He is just exercising a healthy amount of caution.

But this amazing little thing happened this morning:
I looked out my kitchen window, and saw a hummingbird sitting in the tree in my front yard.
I almost couldn't believe it, and had to keep on looking to make sure it was real,
and I used my camera's telephoto lens as a telescope to get a better look:

A Hummingbird in Winter
</center>
It's a male Annas Hummingbird. You can just make out the red top of his head.
<p>
The Hummingbird seemed to be half asleep, like in a torpor. It rarely moved. I frightened it by
opening the window, and it took fright and flew around the tree,
but it came right back to the same place again. It occurred to me to put together a
fresh Hummingbird feeder, because the others are all frozen. I wanted the
Hummingbird to come into my kitchen and get
warm and have some warm sugar-water and eat some fruitflies (which are wintering in my kitchen).
I was talking on the phone while mixing the sugar-water, and a friend suggested putting the
new, warm (not burning hot!) feeder out on the front porch so that the Hummingbird could get
used to it. I did that. The Hummingbird wasn't as sleepy as I thought. When I went out to
feed the other birds, the Hummingbird came right to the feeder, and stayed there for a while,
sitting and feeding and enjoying a warm cup of sugar-water.
It was like a cup of hot cocoa on a cold winter day. Yummy.
He really liked that.

You can just see the tip of the Hummingbird's tongue sticking out.
(What, you've never seen a Hummingbird's tongue before? Well now you have.)

<p>
Three hours later, the Hummingbird was still in the tree in my front yard.
Apparently he has decided to just stay here. He can get food here, and nowhere else in
this frozen snowscape, so why go someplace else?
<p>
I still open the window for him now and then. I removed the screen from the window
so it is wide-open, and he can come in and take a break if he wishes.
But I suspect that he is just too timid to come inside. Too bad. There is a warm
roost and a warm drink and a meal of fruitflies just waiting for him.

<p>
I'm also thinking about making some roosting boxes. The idea is that you make a box that
the birds can sleep in. It will protect them from the wind and contain their body
heat, so it will be warmer than the outside air. Put some horizontal bars in it
for them to roost on and they will rest happily.
You can make different-sized boxes for different-sized birds, and adjust
the front door size accordingly.
You make the box big enough for the whole flock to get in there. This isn't like a nesting
box which is occupied by just one female and babies. This is a group shelter.
And you hang the roosting boxes in the trees or from the porch, or
whereever it is convenient.
<p>
And if I added even a small low-wattage electric heater, it would
make a big difference. I actually saw birds sitting on manhole covers when I was out getting
the bag of birdseed. The warm air coming up from the fermenting sewer is warmer than the winter
air, so the manhole covers are free of snow. So the birds sit there and get a little warmer.
I think they might enjoy a heated roosting box even more.
I don't have wood and wood-working tools handy right now, but even a cardboard box
will make a world of difference.
