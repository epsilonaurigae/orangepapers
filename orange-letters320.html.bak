Really. He actually called to her, and told her that she should come and get some of the bread.

From:  	&quot;Tim W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Hello Orange Papers<br>

<p>
HI

<p>
I am a recovering alcoholic and I have been attending AA for two years.
I stumbled across your website and have read some of the articles and
literary writing that you have added to the site.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tim,
<p>
Thanks for the letters.
<p>
Congratulations on your two years of not drinking.
I have 11, going on 12, years off of alcohol, tobacco, and all other drugs, too.
So I also know something about recovery.
</font>
<p>
I understand some of your concerns but I have to say that I find a lot
of your writing both emotive and quite aggressive in parts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Good. There would be something wrong with me
 if some of my writing wasn't &quot;emotive and aggressive&quot;.

</font>
<p>
The problems in this world in general seem to me to be a lack of
tolerance and understanding for people's quality of life and choice.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Tolerance? There is no reason for us to tolerate criminals who hurt innocent people.
<p>
And choice of lifestyle? Isn't that the first argument of an alcoholic? 
<i> &quot;I am entitled to live however I choose. Who are you to criticize how I live?&quot;</i>

</font>
<p>
Although there are some elements to AA that I don't think are always
healthy, surely we as individuals have a right to accept and make our
own decisions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sure, you have the right to make your own decisions. But you do not have the right to deceive sick
people and shove an old cult religion on them while claiming that you have a cure for
alcohol addiction.
</font>
<p>
AA does not wish to brain wash people or create cult status and your
continued publishing of such &quot;facts&quot; isn't really balanced or
acceptable.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. A.A. constantly brainwashes people. Compare the 12 Steps to the Chinese Communist
brainwashing as described by Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, here:<br>
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8</a>
</font>
<p>
You go to great lengths to discredit the founders and all they have done
and you continue to challenge the numbers of alcoholics who have
recovered under the program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, for good reason. The founders lied, and I'm telling the truth.
 Those are the facts.
</font>
<p>
We are all human and we all make mistakes. We all learn and we all try
to live a full and complete life.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is true, but that is not a reason for shoving quackery on sick people.

</font>
<p>
Mine does not particularly have a God in the true sense of the word and
the AA 12 steps but it does have a desire to give to people and help
people in life.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A desire to help people is a fine thing. The first thing that you should do is learn what
the real truth is, so that you do not mistakenly promote quackery that hurts sick people.
</font>
<p>
This has not been brainwashed into me by some fanatical tyrant, it is my
chosen free will that decided this.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Decided to do what, exactly? &quot;A desire to help people&quot; and
&quot;a desire to promote Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; are very different things.
</font>
<p>
Are you an alcoholic?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Obviously, you have not read much of my web site before writing in to complain, or you would
know the answer to that. Nevertheless:
<p>
<blockquote>
The answer to that question depends entirely on which definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot; you use.
Alcoholics Anonymous uses at least four different definitions of &quot;alcoholic&quot;, and mixes
them up, which really confuses the issue.

<p>
<a name="alcoholic_defs"> </a>
<a name="definitions"> </a>
<blockquote>
The definitions are:
<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol,
almost allergic to alcohol, perhaps a genetic alcoholic; someone who cannot drink
even one drink or his drinking will spin out of control and he will
become readdicted to alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is somebody who cannot quit drinking &#8212; he is
 &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">an insane sinner who is full of disgusting character defects</a>
and moral shortcomings and resentments and barely-contained anger,
and is a prime example of self-will run riot and
instincts run wild and selfishness and self-seeking and the Seven Deadly Sins,
although he doesn't think so...  etc., etc., ...
</ol>
<p>
When I call myself an alcoholic, I usually mean definition 2, and only occasionally
definition 1, but never definitions 3 or 4.
<p>
<ol>
<li> By definition 1, I stopped being an alcoholic more than 11 years ago.
<li> By definition 2, I will always be an alcoholic.
<li> By definition 3, I wasn't an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking, and I did.
I was not &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
I even quit drinking without any help from A.A., because I quit drinking two weeks before I
was ever <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">sent to an A.A. meeting</a>.

<li> By definition 4, I was never an alcoholic. I was always a nice drunk.
People liked having me at their parties because I was so much fun to have around
when I got high. (But, as one friend said, &quot;Even nice drunks die of
cirrhosis of the liver...&quot;)
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

</font>
<p>
I read a letter you have published about a poor woman who was raped by
her boyfriend who was &quot;under the AA program&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
It would help a lot if you would say which letter. There are so many such stories.
</font>
<p>
This intrinsically links AA to a heinous act of sexual violence that has
nothing to do with AA the group and is about an individuals will to
commit a violent crime.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but it does have something to do with the A.A. group. A.A. is rife with sexual
exploitation, and is covering it up.
A.A. meetings are wonderful hunting grounds for sexual predators, and the other A.A. members won't
even call the police and report it.
<p>
<i>The Fix</i> just printed a story about that from a pro-A.A. young woman &#8212;
<a href="orange-letters317.html#teenage_rape" target="_blank">look here</a>.
Mind you, this young woman who wrote the story is still pro-A.A., and still thinks A.A.
is a good thing, in spite of the fact that two A.A. sexual predators raped her,
and she says that A.A. is loaded with predators all over the Los Angeles area,
and they are doing it to countless young women, and A.A. does nothing to stop the
predators or get rid of them.
</font>
<p>
Surely we understand this distinction as this is no different to killing
somebody or committing any other crime. The state sees an individual as
solely responsible.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a great
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a> tap-dance you
are doing there.
As the A.A. slogan says, &quot;You are <i>in denial</i>. Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.&quot;
<p>
One of the worst aspects of Alcoholics Anonymous is
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">all of the sexual exploitation and 13th-Stepping</a>
that is going on. You really have to have your head in the sand to not know about it.
</font>
<p>
Your arguments against coercive writing in the Big Book by Bill W are
clearly juxtaposed in the above passage and you clearly commit the same
act that you accuse the AA founder of doing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Coercive writing? What the heck are you talking about?  You are not making sense there. 
<p>
The phrase &quot;coercive writing&quot; does not appear anywhere in my web site, other than right here.
I just double-checked, and I never said anything about &quot;coercive writing&quot;.
<p>
Maybe you meant to say, &quot;coercive recruiting&quot;, or &quot;coerced A.A.
meeting attendance&quot;, or &quot;coerced sex&quot;, or &quot;coerced religion&quot;?
<p>
I'm not sure what you are talking about when you say, &quot;coercive writing in the Big Book by Bill W&quot;.
<ul>
<li> If you mean
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting like Bill Wilson taught</a>, I don't do that.
I don't recruit at all. I don't own a cult. I don't have any organization.
<li>
If you mean 
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">dishonest writing like Bill Wilson did</a>,
I don't do that either. I try very hard
to make sure that every fact on my web site is true and verified.
</ul>

</font>
<p>
You continue to criticise and degrade an organisation that has helped
many people recover and live a fuller and worthwhile life knowing full
well they will not get &quot;into the ring&quot; to respond to this, as the
organisation will not publically defend or comment on your actions. I
therefore believe your site is somewhat cowardly.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, A.A. has not &quot;helped many people recover and live a fuller and worthwhile life&quot;.
Again, you are making groundless claims.<br>
<ul>
<li>
What is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the real A.A. cure rate</a>?<br>
<li>
What is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">the real A.A. binge drinking rate</a>?

What is 
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">the real A.A. divorce rate</a>?
</ul>
<p>
(Try clicking on those links.)
</font>
<p>
I do not understand your reason for such vitriol and I would guess that
your unbalanced point of view and website will not publish this letter
to counteract some of the detrimental literature that you have posted.

<p>
<font color="blue">
My reason is simple: A.A. is a fraud that is hurting people.
<p>
I try to publish all letters, even those that try to promote and defend Alcoholics Anonymous with
invalid logic and faulty arguments. So I'm publishing yours.
</font>
<p>
Love, peace, understanding, and tolerance is all we need to thrive
together side by side

<p>
<font color="blue">
Those are very nice fluffy words. How about being so nice that we don't foist fraud and quackery
on sick people? How about giving sick people some real help? Wouldn't that be nice and loving?
</font>
<p>
I feel sorry that you expend so much energy taking up your time trying
to counteract what is after all a positive and vital organisation in
society with our negative outpourings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but no, A.A. is not a positive organization. It kills more people than it helps.
That is what this debate is all about.

</font>
<p>
Finally why Orange?

<p>
Yours Sincerely

<p>
Tim W.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I just told you why, Tim. A.A. is a fraud, just
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>
that harms more people than it helps.

<p>
And A.A. sponsors who are neurotic manipulative personalities, sexual
predators, and rapists.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Many are. Not all, but too many.
</font>
<p>
I am an AA sponsor and this generic comment above is simply not true.
You're generalisations are really not balanced and quite ignorant

<p>
<font color="blue">
Two years, and now you are a sponsor? You learned all about how to tell other people how
to live, and overcome addictions and survive, in only two years?
<p>
I am 65 years old, and have 11, almost 12, years of sobriety now, and I wouldn't dream of setting myself
up as a sponsor, putting on airs that I am qualified to tell other people how to live.
Not to mention being qualified to handle all of the various forms of mental illness
that are often mistakenly diagnosed as &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
How many books about addiction and recovery have you read,
besides &quot;The Big Book&quot; and other &quot;council-approved literature&quot;?
How many other methods of recovery have you studied, besides practicing the 12-Step cult religion?<br>
Hint: Try checking out this list:
<a href="orange-top10.html" target="_blank">The Top 10 Reading List</a>.
<p>
Another hint: Try reading the bibliography for my web site. You don't have to read all of those
books, like I have &#8212; that would take you years, probably more than two years &#8212; 
 just read the whole list:<br>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-bibliography.html</a><br>
Now ask yourself, have you educated yourself about addiction and recovery like that?
Don't you think that would be a good idea before you take responsibility for other peoples' lives?

<p>
Doctors have to go to college for eight years, and then do three or four more years of internship
and residency.
But you are qualified to save people after only two years of training?
And what was your training? One or two A.A. meetings per week, and doing Dr. Frank Buchman's
<i>Oxford Group</i> cult religion practices a little bit?

<p>
My &quot;generalizations&quot;, as you call them,
are based on a lot of input. You should read the list of A.A. horror
stories for descriptions of some sponsors who weren't so nice:<br>

Hello Amber,

<p>
Thank you for the letter. That is powerful stuff. And it is so true that
A.A. has a bad case of Flip Wilson's joke &#8212; Geraldine, who was always
proclaiming, &quot;The Devil made me do it.&quot; In A.A., it's always the fault
of Demon Rum.

<p>
What is odd is that people in A.A. meetings can tell tales of horrible
abuse towards family members, or trying to murder a friend in a rage,
and nobody bats an eye. They say that you should not &quot;Take someone
else's inventory&quot;, so nobody faults anybody.

<p>
But if you dare to criticize the A.A. program, oh boy are they quick to
&quot;take your inventory&quot;.

<p>
Funny how that works.

<p>
Again I read more emails to you, I too had a violent father who beat me
and then killed himself.

<p>
He never attended AA meetings, his personality and his behaviour with or
without alcohol were to blame nothing else.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. I also had an abusive alcoholic military sergeant father
who beat me.
Nevertheless, if you are trying to imply that A.A. is innocent because
your father was bad without any help from A.A., then that is broken logic. Of course there are
many bad people who got that way without being involved in A.A., but the point was that
A.A. was supposed to make people better.
<p>
Arguing that A.A. is okay because there are other people who are just as bad outside
of A.A. is no defense of A.A.
As our Founding Father Benjamin Franklin liked to say, &quot;Two wrongs don't make a right.&quot;

</font>
<p>
Anybody who demonstrates tolerance and understanding would not &quot;bat an
eye&quot;. You say this as if all AA members are therefore complicit in the
perpetrators guilt.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse, me, but not &quot;batting an eye&quot; is a big problem with Alcoholics Anonymous.
The resident sexual predators rape the newcomer girls, and nobody bats an eye.
<a href="orange-letters319.html#Anonymous" target="_blank">
Crazy sponsors tell their sponsees not to take their medications</a>,
and then the sponsees die or commit suicide, and nobody bats an eye. They are all very &quot;tolerant&quot;.
That is the problem with A.A. When will A.A. get some morals?
Grow a spine and start standing for something.

<p>
Another victim of A.A. rape &#8212; a 17-year-old girl with a drinking problem &#8212; 
just published her story on &quot;The Fix&quot; web site.
One of her complaints was how no other A.A. members tried to defend her from the
sexual predators:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...the way most of the AA community pretended not to notice what was happening
to me or to countless other girls I got sober with.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes the other A.A. members were quite &quot;tolerant&quot; while the young women were being
sexually exploited, and they refused to &quot;point a finger&quot; at an A.A. old-timer,
not even to defend a 17-year-old girl.
Nobody &quot;batted an eye&quot;.
Read the whole story here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters317.html#teenage_rape" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters317.html#teenage_rape</a> 
<p>
Notice how effective the A.A. brainwashing really is. This young woman still thinks that A.A. is
an okay organization, in spite of all of her experiences. She has been raped by her A.A.
&quot;teachers&quot; twice, and she still doesn't get it. She sees that A.A. is loaded with sexual predators
who have raped &quot;countless other girls&quot;, and she still doesn't get it.
She sees that the A.A. membership just looks the other way and pretends that nothing is happening
as the sexual predators go after the young women, and she still doesn't get it.
Her head is still full of high-falutin' airy-fairy slogans about &quot;helping others&quot;,
and &quot;freely giving to others what was freely given to us&quot;.
This young woman just cannot accept the fact that she didn't join a &quot;self-help&quot; society, she joined
a &quot;help-yourself&quot; society, and oh are the sexual predators helping themselves.
<p>
By the way, when she talks about A.A. being loaded with sexual predators all over the Los Angeles area,
the odds are good that she has gotten mixed up with Clancy Imuslands' <i>Pacific Group</i>.
That is just another sexual-exploitation subcult of A.A. 
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Look here for more stories about Clancy I. and his organization</a>.

</font>
<p>
There has to be a yellow card and anonymity involved otherwise people
have knowhere else to go or feel safe to voice there issues.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A yellow card? Do you mean a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;?
 Do you mean a &quot;commit any crime and not go to jail card?&quot;
Baloney. Alcoholics do not need a private club where they can confess or brag about all of their crimes.
And alcoholics do not need a special club where they can rape any girl and not get busted.
That has nothing to do with just not drinking any more alcohol.
<p>
There is no need for a &quot;yellow card&quot;. What a lame excuse for letting criminals
have free reign.

<p>
Again, you are assuming that practicing 
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>
is necessary to stop drinking alcohol. Not so.
</font>
<p>
And unless its escaped your notice we demonstrate freedom of speech in
the western world and allow people to say things.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, we have Freedom of Speech. People are quite free to say things. And when a guy says, 
&quot;I just raped that pretty newcomer girl who was seeking sobriety and it was fun&quot;, he should go to jail.
He doesn't get to hide behind the A.A. religion. He doesn't get special privileges, or
special immunity, or special confidentiality, or special anonymity, just because
he belongs to the 12-Step religion.
When an A.A. oldtimer rapes a newcomer, he should go to jail. Period. Anonymity be damned.

</font>
<p>
This does not mean we condone it or accept it, it means that we live
democratically.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are misusing the word &quot;democratic&quot;. There is nothing &quot;democratic&quot;
about the A.A. membership looking the other way when the group's resident sexual predators
make a bee-line for the new teenage girl.
You didn't take a vote to see whether your group would
allow the new women to get sexually exploited, did you?
Well, did you vote on it? What was the vote count?
The proper name for such behavior is not &quot;democratic&quot;, it's &quot;lack of moral standards&quot;
and &quot;lack of ethical principles&quot;.

<p>
And, actually, you do condone bad behavior like sexual exploitation and telling sick people
not to take their medications, and foisting crazy cult religion on confused people.
That's the problem with A.A.  You condone it by doing nothing to stop it.
You just practice &quot;tolerance&quot; and let the monsters continue to commit their crimes.
You even deny that there is a problem.
Or you grossly minimize and deny it. That lets it continue.
</font>
<p>
In all your writings you do not discuss the commonality of one alcoholic
gaining some shared understanding of the illness from another.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Drinking too much alcohol isn't an illness, and it isn't a &quot;disease&quot;.
Drinking too much alcohol is behavior.
Spreading misinformation about alcohol abuse helps nobody.
<p>
I have often mentioned the fact that some people get some comfort from sharing experiences with
other people who are also in recovery. That does not mean that you should suddenly start promoting an old
cult religion from the nineteen-thirties as a cure for alcohol addiction.
There is a lot more to Alcoholics Anonymous than just &quot;sharing&quot; stories.
The 12 Steps for instance, are
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's <i>Oxford Group</i>
cult religion recruiting and indoctrination tricks</a>,
not anything about quitting drinking.
<p>
Now if you want some company and brotherhood and sharing of stories of recovery, why don't you try
a non-cult recovery group like SMART or SOS or Lifering?  Here is the list of them:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>

</font>
<p>
The facts remain that some people do get better, they do not take
advantage as you suggest sponsors do and they do try to help people
without wishing to gain in any way for themselves.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sure, some people do get better.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg" target="_blank">It's called <i>spontaneous remission</i></a>.
Each year, approximately five percent of the alcoholics just quit drinking and recover their
health all on their own, no matter where they are. 
A.A. steals the credit for those recovering people who happen to wander into the A.A. &quot;roomz&quot;,
and tries to claim that A.A. was responsible for their sobriety, which isn't true at all.
<p>
When you subtract the normal rate of spontaneous remission from the nominal A.A. recovery rate,
you get a zero-percent recovery rate for the A.A. program.
That means that A.A. does not actually <b><i>cause</i></b> any alcoholics to quit drinking. A.A. just steals
the credit for the people who were going to quit drinking anyway.
<p>
That fact has even been proven by a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.
Dr. George E. Vaillant spent the better part of 20 years shoving A.A. on sick alcoholics, and trying
to prove that A.A. works. He wrote up the results as:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After initial discharge, only five
patients in the [A.A.] Clinic sample <i>never</i> relapsed to alcoholic drinking,
and there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease.<br>
...<br>
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
...<br>
Once again, our results were no better than the natural history of the disorder.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i>, George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1983, pages 283-286.<br>

The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What Dr. Vaillant called &quot;the natural history of the disorder&quot; is what
happens with untreated alcoholics who just recover or die all on their own.
Dr. Vaillant said that the recovery rate of alcoholics who went to Alcoholics Anonymous 
was just the same as the recovery rate of alcoholics who got no treatment or help or
&quot;support group&quot;, and who just recovered or died on their own.
A.A. was completely ineffective and did not improve the recovery rate at all.
But A.A. did
<a href="orange-effectiveness.hmtl#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raise the death rate</a>.
The A.A. group had the highest death rate of any
way of treating alcohol abuse that Dr. Vaillant studied.
<p>

<a href="orange-effectiveness.hmtl#Vaillant" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.hmtl#Vaillant</a>


<p>
It's nice that some A.A. members are good people who would not rape or exploit the newcomers.
Unfortunately, they don't stop the criminals in A.A. from doing it.
I think the French have a saying about that: &quot;He who permits a crime to be committed is guilty of it.&quot;

</font>
<p>
This is my wish, to give as I have been given.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that is the problem. It's like a vampire giving freely, what he was given.
</font>
<p>
Nothing more and a great many good people in AA hold the same premise.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, they all want to recruit new members,
 and promote their favorite religion that they won't call a religion.
</font>
<p>
Your negative portrayal of a minority tarnishes and disrepute's the good
of the majority sir.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hey, if that &quot;moral majority&quot; would get off of their asses and do something to stop the
rapes, and the 13th-Stepping, and telling sick people not to take their medications, and foisting
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">the dogma of a crazy old fascistic cult religion</a>
on desperately ill people, then I wouldn't have so much to write about, would I?

From:  	&quot;bodrell&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thanks and where's Carmen?<br>

<p>
I've been in and out of AA for a couple of years and it never stuck &#8212; I
always drank despite having a sponsor, working the steps, blah blah..
Although I never got in deep enough to get the &quot;cult&quot; aspect &#8212; and my
former sponsor is 17 years sober, a cool lady, atheist and on our first
meeting encouraged me to get psych help and meds &#8212; the mental gymnastics I
was trying to go through in order to believe in helplessness, not thinking,
higher powers and searching and fearless moral inventories that included
only bad stuff, but none of the good stuff, got to be too much to take.
<p>
Also, I dreaded becoming one of those 20-year-sober people who still attend
multiple meetings per day and have their entire identity wrapped up in
being an AA &quot;success story.&quot;. Seriously, WTF... that is not a life and these
people scared me away. Nice people all, but they did NOT have what I wanted.

<p>
Your research and thoughts, helped clarify for me why AA just wasn't my bag
although I'm sincerely happy it works for many. I suppose addiction to AA
is better than addiction to alcohol. I am making it work with good old
will-power, AVRT and other such tools and psych meds for the brain cooties.

<p>
My main reason for writing though &#8212; what happened to Carmen the gosling, in
the end? Maybe I'm dense (distinct possibility, that)... I kept trying to
follow her story on your site but getting derailed onto non-Carmen goose
stories.

<p>
Thanks.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bodrell,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and have your head screwed
on straight. Congratulations.
<p>
I have to object to just one phrase, the one about &quot;it works for many&quot;. Actually, I think you
will find that many people just recover because that is what they are going to do.
Some people just finally choose to improve their lifestyle, and live.
Just like how you did, and I did. The fact that some people were wasting
their spare time by going to A.A. meetings doesn't mean that the A.A.
&quot;program&quot; worked for them, and caused them to get sober.
<p>
The simple proof of that is the fact that groups of people who go to A.A. have exactly the
same recovery rate as people who don't go to A.A. Going to A.A. doesn't improve the
recovery rate at all.
<p>
Worse yet, A.A. increases the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">death rate</a>,
the
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">suicide rate</a>,
the
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">divorce rate</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking rate</a>.
So &quot;the program&quot; isn't really working for anybody.

<p>About Carmen:<br>
The geese often leave the Waterfront Park area in the middle of the summer because of
the crowds. There are numerous big parties and affairs during the summer
 where crowds of people occupy Waterfront Park.
When the Waterfront Park Blues Festival is happening, the entire place is
paved with people, like 25,000 of them, so the geese just leave.
The geese go upriver or to other parks to get some peace and quiet and grass to eat.
Worse, the crowds of people trample the grass and pretty well kill it,
and it takes a long while to recover in the heat of the summer.
So the geese don't come back for a while, not until the grass regrows.

The grassy bay at Waterfront Park, Portland, Oregon
</center>
This is where the geese like to hang out and eat the grass  &#8212;  and get munchies from humans
whenever they can.
This is also the same field as where they stage the Waterfront Park
Blues Festival each July 4th.
</font></font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
What that means is, the babies go away while they are still cute little fuzz-balls with
half baby down and half feathers, and they come
back decked out in an adult suit of feathers. Consequently, it's really hard
to identify which adult-looking goose with feathers was which gosling.
<p>
It was three years ago when I last saw Carmen. It was late summer, just about this
time of year, and the geese had finally come back, and I
was feeding them bread in Waterfront Park. Carmen's family flew in, and landed
on the grassy field at Waterfront Park, and walked up to me to see if they could get any 
bread from me. Yes, the whole family was flying. They still had three goslings,
which were almost as big as adults, so that means that Carmen, Blondie, and Sam all survived.
<p>
Unfortunately, I had just run out of bread. The other geese ate it all just before
Carmen arrived. Carmen's family had a habit of arriving late for the party. When
they saw that I was out of bread, they turned away, and joined the flock in munching grass.
They just blended into the crowd.
It was just as they were turning away that I saw the markings on the sides of the parents' heads,
and realized that this was Carmen's family. They disappeared into the crowd quickly, and
I didn't want to just chase them, trying to get some photographs, so I just got a couple
of mediocre shots as they mingled with the flock.
<p>
With 20-20 hindsight, I wish I had chased them and gotten some good shots, so that I would
know for sure what Carmen looks like as an adult. I want to know what the shapes of the white
markings on the sides of her head are.
<p>
Since then, I moved out of downtown Portland and out to Forest Grove, way out in the boondocks, and
I only rarely get over to Waterfront Park now. Carmen could be showing up there often and I
wouldn't know it.

<p>
Now that Carmen is 3 1/3 years old, she is almost certainly married and has children of her
own. Canada Geese mate for life at 2 1/2 years of age, and produce their first clutch of eggs at
3 years.
So the odds are, somewhere out there, Carmen has some nearly-grown babies of her own.
They probably have feathers now and are flapping their wings and getting ready for flying
lessons.
<p>
I would really like to see that.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello again, Anonymous,
<p>
<a href="orange-intro.html#issues" target="_blank">I got the same attitude</a>
from my so-called &quot;counselor&quot; in an
&quot;outpatient treatment&quot; program.
When I said that I had previously quit drinking for three years, all on my own, the Stepper counselor
said that I had not had a period of &quot;recovery&quot;, I was &quot;only abstaining&quot;, because I had not
&quot;dealt with any issues&quot;.
<p>
Translation: you didn't go to A.A. meetings and practice the 12 Steps and confess all of your sins,
so those three years don't count.
<p>
You are right: Years of sobriety outside of A.A. mean nothing to the Steppers. They only count
and cheer for years of A.A. membership.
<p>
I have had many Steppers sneer at my years of sobriety without A.A. When I ask them why they cheer for
somebody picking up a 3-month coin at an A.A. meeting, while dismissing 3 years of sobriety outside of
A.A. as worthless, they usually ignore the question and don't answer it.
<a href="orange-letters7.html#cheer_for" target="_blank">Look here</a> for one example of that,
and his evasive non-answer
<a href="orange-letters7.html#cheer_for2" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Happily, my liver didn't care whether I went to A.A. meetings. It appreciated the period of recovery
that let it repair itself before the next tsunami of alcohol.
That's why I don't need a liver transplant now.
<p>
By the way, I'm getting that less and less of that A.A. attitude
now that I have 11, going on 12, years of sobriety.
I have far more sober time than the vast majority of A.A. members, so they aren't
so quick to sneer at my years.
They usually just don't mention it.

<p>
Have a good day.

Bill Wilson created &quot;Billshit&quot;.    I have recovered from alcohol abuse.  Recovery
requires will-power not higher-power.  My sober date is and will always be
10.27.1980 because I  have the power to make it so.  There is no such thing as
alcoholism.  I will never drink/drug again.   Billshit Wilson was a thief, liar and

Hello, Mr. Hodgins.
<p>
 I appreciate the enormity of the work you've done
on this site, and believe that a justly commensurate (not a
contemptuous) response to it is to investigate ALL of it. I have done
so. The letters section is especially instructive. In fact, I'd urge
fellow AA members daunted by the contents page to work (methodically)
through the letters and the responses: all of the site's core ideas
are linked, when appropriate, in these responses, and the letters from
steppers far too often demonstrate how these ideas developed, what
they're about, and what gave their expression so much passion
throughout the site.
<p>
More bluntly: steppers,  if you say &quot;Agent Orange&quot; could not
possibly know what it is like to be dying of alcohol abuse, he'll add
you to a list of others who have made the same (false) claim. If you
then suggest (also falsely) that he must be drinking to have
challenged 12-step programs, he'll add you to another list. Or if you
hear that he's been sober for 12 years, and so aver (incorrectly) that
he is a dry drunk, there's a long list for that. Perhaps you'll accuse
him of having an epic resentment; there is an epic list of such
accusations. You might decide that &quot;Orange&quot; needs to know that AA has
saved millions of lives; the claim you'll really be making is that you
neither know nor care about what's on the very first pages of this
site. Or you may want to teach &quot;Orange&quot; about all the alcoholics and
addicts he may be killing; and so you will be added to the list of
steppers who may be displaying that they are &quot;unteachable.&quot; Maybe
you'll judge the site to be a prime example of &quot;contempt prior to
investigation.&quot;
<p>
In so saying these things, you &#8212; can you see this? &#8212; have SHOWN
contempt: not only before but OF investigation. A major premise of The
Orange Papers is that (despite the chanting of quotes attributed to
Herbert Spencer) AA and other such groups encourage a reductivist
mindset, coupling passionate defense of 12-step &quot;principles&quot; with a
truculent refusal to think critically about them (or challenges to
them). A related premise is that 12-step groups promote dishonesty and
closed-mindedness in defense of their core practices (two of which are
rigorous honesty and open-mindedness), and thus that a chief
concomitant of 12-step group practice is hypocrisy. Do you really want
your response to become a part of the proof of these things?
But I said I was a member of AA, so perhaps I should explain. I've
lost too much, and too often come too close to dying, from abuse of
alcohol, opioid painkillers, benzodiazepines, and sleeping pills, to
want to quibble with anyone over whether I'm truly an alcoholic and an
addict. A year and a half ago, the drugs cost me a very good job and a
wife (that loss is grievous beyond description); I went to my fourth
rehab (over a 23 year period.) All of these facilities are in Texas,
and all displayed perfect conformity with the Minnesota Model of
rehabilitation: daily trips to AA and NA meetings, &quot;therapeutic&quot;
sessions designed around the steps, outside facilitators whose task
was to help patients find a &quot;higher power&quot; (one Who would accept a
surrender and honor it with grace), and an expectation that successful
completion of a month of treatment was contingent upon working the
first five steps, getting a sponsor, and identifying and scheduling at
least another month's worth of 12-step meetings.
<p>
I was exposed to AA during my first stint in rehab, in 1986, after
I'd drunk myself out of a wonderful opportunity (like you, I'm a
Berkeley might-have-been; I was in the English PhD program in the
mid-1980s), and had begun to experience seizures, severe panic
attacks, and much despair. I read the Big Book, saw the
bait-and-switch about God (I was and am agnostic; with regard to the
divinity I was supposed to come to believe in, an omnipotent creator
of everything, whose wholly benevolent relationship with His sentient
creations is knowable by them if only they make the aforementioned
surrender, I am an atheist), and concluded that AA was a cult that
would need not to be a part of my necessary abstinence from alcohol. I
was told then, by counselors in that first rehab, that alcoholics like
me (already there had been brain and liver damage; and certainly while
drinking I became obsessive about the acquisition of more alcohol)
could not recover without AA.
<p>
Despite this therapeutically unbiased advice, I was sober almost 12
years without AA; then I chose to medicate lifelong social anxiety,
depression, and ruthless self-criticism with the drug cocktail
mentioned above. Perhaps the medicine would have worked if I had taken
one pill, rather than one bottle of pills, at a time; but I like
getting high, and have proven to my own satisfaction that I will abuse
ANY CNS depressant once I begin to take it (except under the strictest
supervision &#8212; and I don't want to test even that qualification unless
I'm in unbearable physical pain).
<p>
So there have been three drug-induced rehab experiences in the last
decade or so, all in Midland or Lubbock, TX; and as noted, I've been
sober since the last one (January 2011). I lived in Odessa, TX; now
I'm in Hobbs, NM; these places are small and conservative, and have
nothing but AA and NA available for social support during recovery.
I've been to over 1000 meetings (almost all AA) in 18 months, and do
very much value the social support. I cannot swear I owe &quot;the program&quot;
my life, but I know I owe a lot to these parts of it: the social
contact, steps 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 (from which I have flensed the word
&quot;God,&quot; and which I take cafeteria-style, despite admonitions from
sponsors in two different towns), and work with newcomers, who are
often as desperate as I was 18 months ago: desperate, confused,
lonely, and hurting.
<p>
But I'm writing because a meeting last night (a regular Big Book
study) helped me to put into the starkest possible contrast some of
the contrary threads of my journey to and in AA (mirrored in the
somewhat incoherent narrative above). There were three old-timers
present, one of whom asked where I'd been lately. I said I'd been busy
with work (I'm a college English teacher, summer sessions are hellish
anyway, and I'm training for a new position); he opined that &quot;work is
what we do between meetings.&quot;
<p>
In truth I have been avoiding certain meetings (like this one) as
much because old-timers (like this one) tend to dominate the sharing,
to speak entirely in programese (described below), and to view and
react to new information in such Procrustean terms that any honest
expression of ambivalence (like mine &#8212;especially acute this week
thanks my study of your work, Mr. Hodgins) quite literally makes no
sense.
<p>
Another of the worthies present was my sponsor in Hobbs; he greeted
me warmly and then began the liturgy. I won't mention anything
specific about what was shared in the meeting, or say much else about
who was there (because I take seriously our confidentiality chant at
the conclusion of each meeting), but there were  relative newcomers on
hand (I've been working with one of them; he has serious doubts of his
own about &quot;The Program,&quot; and needs more than anything simply to talk
and be heard), they were palpably hurting while the old-timers shared,
and yet the old-timers did not deviate from the recruiting spiels they
give whenever they share: imagine a savagely maintained countenance of
serenity, a mask of equanimity through which anyone can perceive hard
eyes, clinched jaws, restless hands and feet like small, wounded
animals  retracing circles of painfully prolonged death spasms, and a
hectoring tone appropriate for a used-car salesman auditioning as a
substitute preacher.
<p>
So it was as these men spoke, and they presented their mien and the
tone of their spiels as the theme of their spiels: join the fellowship
of AA, come all the way in (don't hover around the periphery), work
the steps, and all who suffer can have what they so self-evidently
already have. The problem, of course, is that that pitch, to that
audience, is all promise of fellowship bereft of any trace of actual
fellowship. I would like to have said as much, but I fear that
programese has been designed (perhaps like Newspeak) to render certain
concepts (like uncertainty) utterly ineffable.
<p>
That bugged me more than usual last night, so after the meeting
(and after I checked in with my newcomer friend), I tried to corned my
sponsor and bespeak as honestly as I could the burgeoning frustration
I have with AA's capacity for reductivism and cultic practice. But he
had the answer: &quot;David, you just need to get a higher power.&quot; (The
implication is, of course, that if I have no God, I must think I am
God; that's one of the more pervasive Billogisms one hears in AA). And
to that I had no answer at all &#8212; for reasons I hope I have made clear
here.
<p>
Here, at this site, I needn't say more (which is more refreshing
than I can say). I'll continue to make meetings, because they're far
better for my soul than isolation (I think I mentioned the parochial
quality of my town, and my social anxiety), and because I have my own
tools (playing the tape out, being honest with at least one or two
others &#8212; who know about addiction from the inside, even if they are
certain about nothing else &#8212; about cravings and feelings of
desperation, recognizing and dismissing what you call the lizard
brain, etc.) to offer others who want to practice a daily maintenance
of their sober condition; my life is far better than it was 18 months
ago, because I've been sober and am getting to know myself as I have
never really been before as an adult.
<p>
Thanks again for your perspicuity and diligence. You remind me more
than a little of Harlan Ellison (I suspect you'll find the comparison
flattering, based on the political and social activism and interests
described on the site; HE writes better, but you're a far more
methodical and sedulous researcher). I do have a fair amount of mostly
minor criticism to offer about the site, but this already bloated
letter doesn't need another growth spurt. Oh: I tried to register in
July for your forum, but have not heard anything. I'd like to be
involved in that. Congratulations on your sobriety. Have a great day,
<p>

Hello David,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. There is obviously so much that I agree with. I won't just repeat it all.
And congratulations on your sobriety, and thanks for the compliments.
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and are still sane.

<p>
I can really relate to this line:
<font color="black">
 [Steppers] &quot;have SHOWN contempt: not only before but OF investigation.&quot;
</font><br>
Yes, exactly. That's why it is nearly impossible to carry on a reasonable
 debate or a discussion with them  &#8212;  they
just reject all facts that they don't like without investigating to see whether they are actually true.
They really don't want to allow any foreign facts to lodge between their ears.

<p>
That is nothing new of course. The high priests of the Vatican refused to look through Galileo's telescope.
They just knew, without looking, that it was an instrument of the Devil, and what it would show was untrue.

<p>
And thanks for the phrase &quot;pervasive Billogisms&quot;. I don't recall ever having heard that one before.
It's cute. I'll have to use it again, somewhere.
<p>
I never got into Harlan Ellison. I'll have to check him out.


<p>
Thanks for the compliment about open-minded thinking.
You can also find open-minded intelligent discourse in other places too, you know. You don't have to
be isolated. May I suggest this list:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">Here is the list of non-cult organizations and methods</a>.
<p>
Many of those organizations have forums or chat groups or bulletin boards where you can discuss things
in a sane and intelligent manner.
<p>
Oh, about the registration: Thanks for mentioning it. Occasionally genuine humans' registrations get lost in
the river of spambots' fake registrations. The situation has gotten so bad lately that I'm getting about
3000 fake registrations from the professional spammers' computer programs <i>each day</i>.
Yes, all over the world, spammers run computer programs day and night, that just crawl the web and
try to create user accounts in forums, so that they can then post spam advertisements for everything from
fake Viagra and Canadian pharmacies to London call girls. Oh, and of course the cute Russian girls who
want to sleep with me if I will just send them air fare to get here.
It seems that spam email is on the way out because
everybody is running spam filters now. So the spammers are switching to hammering forums and bulletin boards
and things like that.
<p>
I can easily distinguish most of the fake registrations
because they do stupid things like make up user names with random letters and numbers. But once in a while,
as I'm scanning the list of new registrations, I overlook a real human. So I like to hear if anybody is
having trouble getting their registration approved.
If you haven't been approved within a week, then something is definitely
wrong. Sometimes I get sidetracked for a few days, but you should always get approved within a week.
I approve all humans, and reject all spambots.
<p>
What I always need is the user name that you registered. The Drupal forum software that I use doesn't
have any way to look up people by email address, only by user name. So if you tell me what user name
you registered, I'll find it and approve it.
<p>
Have a good day now.

This goose is half Greylag Goose and half Canada Goose. Gus seems to have at least
two surviving offspring from previous years, along with his current little youngster
this year. Gus has bad luck with the survival rate of his children  &#8212;  he
seems to have only one surviving child per year, but they are still adding up.
Apparently Gus and his wife have been making children for at least three years now.
