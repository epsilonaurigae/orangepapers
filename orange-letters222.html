Subject:  	Hi Orange<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I just wanted to say that I'm still working through your letters (I try to pace
myself, as I don't know what I'll do when I must wait for the newest installment)
and there is something extremely comforting about having seen your picture several
times now. I'm unable to explain why that is. I never consciously thought of you as
some disembodied logic-monster or anything. But, when I see your picture, I just
wanna give you a great big hug for being you and for having the courage (and the
dedication) to continue on with your extensive and priceless website. And I'm not a
particularly &quot;touchy&quot; person, so I find that urge to be strange. I must admit, if I
saw you playing guitar with your goslings by the river, I would be confused as all
hell when you didn't want to smoke a joint.

</font>
<p>
I've been doing my small part to get the truth out there. I'm lucky enough to know
some people in positions (either professionally, privately, or both) who are the
sort people might turn to (or be pointed towards) if they had a problem with drugs
or alcohol. Also lucky, is that the one thing as well established as my reputation
as a hard partying, was my reputation as a straight shooter, and I never did manage
to sully that. So, what would normally be an uphill battle against a juggernaught of
a propaganda machine, ends up being much easier than expected, as I'm given the
benefit of the doubt. All but one of these people has been shocked and horrified
when I laid out the simple facts before them. Whether or not they followed up and
went to your website, I wouldn't know. The one person who wasn't surprised is a
woman I know who understands human nature very intimately. She said &quot;I always
wondered what the deal was with AA, I kind of figured it was for people with nothing
good in their lives&quot;. I think that's actually fairly accurate, and what I think is
terribly sad, is that I suspect most of the membership did have good things in their
lives when they started attending, and threw them away for the sake of their much
sought after sobriety.

<p>
Your website continues to spur me on new courses of thought that I find incredibly
interesting. It started with wanting to know every detail about how screwy AA is,
and now I'm wondering about other issues as well, like recovery or treatment centers
or support groups as a whole. Initially, while I accepted your assessment of AA, I
felt you were grasping at straws with what I saw as a weird conspiracy theory about
treatment centers. I had always thought of them as an entirely separate entity from
12 step groups, although I knew people in &quot;treatment&quot; were expected to attend those
meetings, I thought it was supplementary to an actual, fact based, medical treatment
in the facility. I almost wish I were still friends with the people I used to party
with, so I could ask them about their experiences at rehab. I have a very distinct
memory that illustrates (in my opinion) both the ineffectiveness of treatment
facilities, and addictive thought process. The same day an old friend of mine got
out of a month long inpatient program, the first thing she did after she got home
was come pick me up so we could go score some blow. It seemed logical to me, she was
addicted to heroin, cocaine should be OK, right? And obviously it made sense to her
too, although I can't say what her reasoning was.

<p>
I had a question for you, have you always avoided using profanity, or do you avoid
using it on your website so that people have one less reason to dismiss you without
looking at the evidence you provide?

<p>
Again, thank you for all that you've done and continue to do, I believe that you're
doing the world a great service. This may sound corny, but I hope in five years
we're both still above ground and sober. Hey, that sounds almost like fellowship
and I don't even know you! We've GOT to get this message out to the alcoholic who
still suffers.

<p>
Yes, that is what cults do to people. Members often have to lower their standards in order
to fit in. One of the first lessons that they learn is that they have to lie and
just parrot the cult's dogma, even if they know it isn't quite true.
And one of the first pieces of dogma is how bad the
members are, or were, before they got &quot;saved&quot; by the glorious cult.
Then people have to devote their lives to a cult, and ignore the outside world,
and drop their former associations and activities.
Some of the cults that I described in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>
actually taught their people to lie, steal, con, deceive, short-change, even
pimp and prostitute to get more money for the cult. And those people originally
would never have dreamed of doing such things. They were looking for Jesus or God
or enlightenment or something like that. But the cult changed them.
<p>

About the link between A.A. and treatment centers, I learned about that one early in the
game,
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">by actually going to a treatment center</a>.
There, I learned that the &quot;treatment&quot; was
just going to some &quot;group encounter&quot;  sessions (sitting around and talking
about drinking and doping), and then being told, &quot;Go to three meetings
per week, or preferably, one every day.&quot; It was of course assumed that the
&quot;meetings&quot; would be A.A. or N.A. That's all that was on the list
of meetings that they handed out.
Shoving people into Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous <i>was</i> the &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>
And all of the &quot;counselors&quot; were members of 12-Step groups too. (People who
are &quot;in recovery&quot; work cheaper than real health-care professionals.)

<p>
About the profanity, it's just a matter of style. Oh, I use a few words now and then, but
mostly, I find that someone's speech actually carries more weight if he can say what he
means without profanity.
Someone whose every fourth word is a four-letter word gives the impression that his thinking
isn't very deep, and his vocabulary is limited.

<p>
And if I can keep my cool while some critic is raving obscenities, it just makes him look
like a nutcase.

Subject:  	Buddhist Iron Fist<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Thanks for your attitude in these letters. You are for the most part respectful and
direct in opposition and show a very open mind. I know that is hard when you have XA
cult members writing to you in very offensive and unkind ways, eg i know you think
your gawds little messenger-when in fact it is the XA cult which teaches them THEY
are all gawds lil msngrs. I have yet to see an instance where you have been
unkind-though simply trying to educate the masses on what XA Cult is REALLY about
and the facts which show exactly how XA is organized and founds and is in PRACTICE
seems cruel. I like it to having the lights turned on after a long sleep...it may
hurt a bit at first but truly in my opinion you have helped more people than XA has
EVER. Maybe you can give me your thoughts on why so much hate mail?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kevin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. Why so much hate mail? I think it just
comes with the territory. Cult members are desperately clinging to a fantasy,
hoping that the cult will save them and give their lives meaning.
It really upsets them when someone challenges their favorite fantasies.

</font>
<p>
Now I wish to thank you for the Free Tibet link and especially discounting the
writer who claimed HS the Dalai Lama rules with an &quot;iron fist.&quot; If anyone has ever
heard the Dalai Lama speak, surely you have to see how very kind and loving and happy
his message is, not at all totalitarian. I have been studying and attempting to
practice Buddhism for about 5 years now and have heard of nothing like what the
person claimed about the former Tibetan government. Everything i've read it would
have me to believe Tibet was a beautiful place and all the people were very
happy... they seemed to have a high literacy rate and the monasteries were all full. I
understand too the Chinese have moved into the area trying to populate and displace.
A problem they encountered is pregnant Chinese mothers... they are
<a href="orange-letters223.html#bilirubin" target="_blank">losing their
babies because of the lack of oxygen in high altitudes</a>.
They have to bring them down
to lower altitudes during birth. Something which His Holiness said which shows how
tolerant loving and kind buddism and he is, &quot;if science shows something in Buddhism
is wrong, then Buddhism must change.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I doubt if the fellow who sent that in even guessed that he was repeating propaganda
that was almost certainly created in Beijing by a Communist fiction writer.
Rule with an iron fist? As I said before, the Dalai Lama never ruled Tibet for one single day.
He was just a boy, and a regent ruled in his place. Then a Chinese general ruled Tibet
with an iron fist.  Isn't it interesting how the propagandists reverse reality?
The Chinese generals rule harshly, with an iron fist, so they say that the Dalai
Lama ruled with an iron fist.

</font>
<p>
Why do you think XA fosters so much anger, especially to opposite viewpoints and
simple facts and scientific solutions? Is because XA is a cult like most
fundamentalist religions? Because we all know XA is not going to disappear, though
we can hope, it cannot be the XA's cultist fearing loss of prestige.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
KC

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, I think that cult members are secretly really afraid that I'm right, and that the cult is
lying to them. There goes their whole life. They have wasted years on a hoax.
Now what are they going to do? How will they live without the cult?
Oh no, that can't be true.
<p>
As one astute observer said:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The common dogma [of fundamentalists] is fear of
modern knowledge, inability to cope with the fast
change in a scientific-technological society, and
the real breakdown in apparent moral order in recent
years.... That is why hate is the major fuel, fear
is the cement of the movement, and superstitious
ignorance is the best defense against the dangerous
new knowledge. ... When you bring up arguments that
cast serious doubts on their cherished beliefs you
are not simply making a rhetorical point, you are
threatening their whole Universe and their immortality.
That provokes anger and quite frequently violence. ...
Unfortunately you cannot reason with them and you
even risk violence in confronting them. Their numbers
will decline only when society stabilizes, and
adapts to modernity.<br>
==  G. Gaia<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And your question brings up another point: that of aggrieved differences between
cult members and non-members. I wrote this
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#aggrieved" target="_blank">in the cult test</a>
a long time ago:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The specialness of the cult is frequently expressed by contrasting the cult with
&quot;everyone else out there.&quot; Those other people weren't
smart enough or good enough to join the cult. A mindset of
<i>us versus them</i> is encouraged. There is almost always a
distinction, <i>usually aggrieved</i>,
between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now why that <i>&quot;aggrieved&quot;</i>? Why are cult members so quick
to start angrily complaining about how &quot;they done us wrong&quot;?
Cult members will tell you that they have been oppressed by
the bad guys for hundreds or thousands of years, when they are only 20 or 25 years old,
and have only been in the cult for three years. I've heard 3HO members complaining about
how India had oppressed the Sikhs for several centuries, and murdered their saint Nanuk, 
and how unfair and wrong that treatment was. We are talking about American kids who just joined 3HO
a few years earlier. Now, the mistreatment of the Sikhs is suddenly the biggest
tragedy in their lives.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous members are eager to tell you about how the outsiders don't understand
alcoholism at all, and it's a disease, not a moral stigma, so it was wrong to
criticize alcoholics for drinking themselves to death, etc...
The ignorant people have been wrong about alcoholics for centuries, mistreating alcoholics,
giving them bad treatment, punishing them and being unfair to them... Nobody understands.
<i>They</i> just don't know how it is. 
<i>They</i> will trigger us and get us killed.

<p>
I suspect that cults are good at twisting the members' emotions around, and redirecting
old griefs and sorrows. Do you have lingering anger from having been an abused child?
Were you always the unpopular kid at school? Did your life never seem to work out?
Do you get no respect? Does everybody consider you a real loser?
Join a cult and blame your unhappiness on <i>Suppressive Persons</i>, or Satan, or the Jews,
or the Blacks,
or aliens (either kind, Martians or Mexicans),
or the other political party, or the government, or the Communists,
or Whitey, or a competing church, or whatever.
<i>It's all their fault.</i>
<p>
In the case of A.A. and N.A., the enemy is everybody who doesn't believe in the 12 Steps.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Well, actually, one thing occurs to me right now: The one thing that I cannot write

<p>
Hi Orange.
<p>
 I have been having SO much fun reading your letters  lately. I
just finished Amanda's letter and your responses to her. (All quite
brilliant BTW.) I feel for the poor girl, hopefully she will get off of the AA  bus
to nowhere.

<p>
My reason for writing today is this. You presented Amanda with this
list....

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<ol>
<li> Bill Wilson never stopped philandering and keeping mistresses
and using Alcoholics Anonymous meetings as meat markets, and using the A.A. headquarters
as an employment agency for his harem of mistresses.
<a href="orange-BillWill.html" target="NewDocWindow">Bill even left 10% of his <i>Book Book</i>
royalties to his favorite mistress in his will</a>.

<li> Bill Wilson never stopped raving crazy stuff.  He never recanted on
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">his claims of
being a medium who spoke to the spirits of the dead</a>.

<li> Bill Wilson never gave back
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">all of the money that he stole</a>.
<li> Bill Wilson never quit smoking, while declaring that
&quot;Half measures availed us nothing&quot;,
and claiming that the &quot;spiritual&quot; 12 Steps worked as a
&quot;solution&quot; to addictions.

<li> Bill Wilson never admitted that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">his copy of Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>
did not work to make alcoholics quit drinking alcohol.
<li> Bill Wilson never stopped 
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">lying about the A.A. history</a>.

</ol>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
All of these are factual and true..... but one little thing  that so many
seem to miss about Wilson AND his proctologist sidekick  Dr. Bob, is the fact
that neither of them worked the 12 steps, at  least not in the way the rest
of the sheep in AA are supposed to work  them.  I have yet to read in any AA
literature how  these men worked the steps and when they worked them. They
were both excellent  &quot;teachers&quot; on HOW we should work them, but they didn't
work them IN ORDER the  way AA sponsors direct their sponsees to work them.

<p>
I had one sponsor try and point out to me in the first 164 pages of  the
book where Bill worked all of them ...ahem....  before he  wrote them????
..... I  found her explanation a little bit shaky,  but kept my mouth shut
because I didn't want to drink and die.

<p>
This was but one of the many questions I had about the&quot;Program of
Recovery&quot; during my long tenure at AA. Every time I queried an old timer  (or one of
my many sponsors over the years) about something that  didn't seem to fit
quite right in the world of reason, I was told  that:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. Do not question the program....it is a sign of relapse, you will  drink
and die.

<p>
<li>
2. You have one foot out the door. Do you really want  to drink and
die?...don't question the program.

<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
<li>
3. Why does it matter when so many millions have  recovered?

<p>
<li>
4. Of course Wilson and Dr. Bob worked the program, you  silly.

<p>
<li>
5. Don't question whether Bill and Bob made their amends, you will  drink
and die.

<p>
<li>
6. You will drink and die!

<p>
<li>
7. It's all there &quot;It's in the book!&quot;

Hello Renee,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, it is crazy, isn't it? &quot;Don't drink and don't think.&quot;
&quot;Just listen and do what we say.&quot; Not coincidentally, that is also the Nazi
philosophy: &quot;The common man is too stupid to think for himself. He should just follow
orders.&quot;
<p>
I think that the Oxford Group had Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob and Clarence Snyder doing
something, but it wasn't the Twelve Steps. Maybe something that they called
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#five_C" target="_blank">the Five C's</a>&quot;,
 or
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#lists" target="_blank">The Six Practices of the Sane</a>&quot;
&#8212; the Oxford Group recruiting and indoctrination cult practices
that Bill Wilson rewrote into &quot;the 12 Steps&quot;.
Ebby Thacher had Bill doing his big confession session when he was in Charlie Towns'
Hospital in December of 1934. That's while he was tripping his brains out on belladonna.
It probably helped Bill to flip out and &quot;see God&quot;
(<a href="orange-letters193.html#spiritual_experience" target="_blank">if that really happened
&#8212; if that story wasn't just another one of Bill's self-aggrandizing fabrications</a>).
<p>
Still, I think it's accurate to say that Bill never did the 12 Steps.
It seems that, by the time he wrote them down, he felt that he had done them, and didn't need them.
Bill Wilson sure as heck didn't go around &quot;making amends&quot; for all of his wrong-doing,
and &quot;promptly admitting&quot; when he was wrong.
Not a raving narcissist like him. That kind of grovelling is
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#tip_reporter" target="_blank">for <i>the little people</i></a>.

<p>
And I seem to recall that Dr. Bob was not all that enthusiastic about
the 12 Steps, either, in spite of the talk about how Bob took 4800
alcoholics through the Steps in 8 years.
Dr. Bob's idea of &quot;working the Steps&quot; was to take the newcomers
through the Steps in a day or two.
Dr. Bob seems to have preferred to read the Bible and talk about Christ.
He remained much more Oxford Group-oriented than Bill Wilson.
(<a href="orange-letters212.html#DrBobTrad" target="_blank">Dr. Bob was also opposed</a> to Bill's
&quot;<a href="orange-traditions.html" target="_blank">Twelve Traditions</a>&quot;.)

<p>
Have a good day now.

Do you see a pattern here, Stress is a &quot;brain&quot; function. Yes, R2D

your stress comes from, before a lapse or relapse, it is possible to
avoid it. You can get well.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, now this looks interesting.
<p>
I have to disagree with his first line. His definition of &quot;addiction&quot; is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by compulsion to seek and take drugs, and has been linked to dysregulation of brain regions that mediate reward and stress.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That poor addiction is constantly relapsing? That is standard Stepper gibberish.
A human may relapse, but a condition doesn't.
<p>
And not all ex-addicts chronically relapse. Plenty of them just quit and stay quit forever.
Personally, I know three heroin ex-addicts who quit just that way.
They did one quitting, one time, and that was it for the rest of their lives.
And they didn't do any 12 Steps or join any &quot;support group&quot;, either.
They just quit and stayed quit, and were happy to be free of that addiction.

<p>
And my ex-wife quit smoking, once, and that was it forever. Or at least for the last
35 years now, and I don't think she is going to start smoking again now.

<p>
Addiction is a condition where someone's body is physiologically habituated
to receiving regular doses of some chemical, and, if the dose is suddenly missing,
the addict goes through painful readjustments (called &quot;withdrawal&quot;).
<p>
The definition of addiction has nothing to do with whether someone might return to
his old bad habits after a while.

<p>
Further on down, the author repeated the standard Stepper dogma:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by
compulsive drug use and loss of control over drug intake.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The A.A. &quot;loss of control&quot; dogma has been thoroughly disproven.
Read Herbert Fingarette's book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Fingarette" target="_blank"><i>Heavy Drinking: The Myth of Alcoholism as a Disease</i></a>.
Herbert Fingarette is a distinguished
professor at the University of California, and has been a
consultant on alcoholism and addiction to the World Health
Organization and a Fellow of the Stanford Center for Advanced
Studies in the Behavioral Sciences. Prof. Fingarette found that alcoholics are not
&quot;powerless&quot;, or suffering from a &quot;loss of control&quot;.
The truth is, they have lots of control over their drug and alcohol consumption.

<p>
Furthermore, if the poor alcoholics and addicts are so powerless and out
of control, how is it that they just quit their bad habits one day?
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">And yet they do</a>.
It happens all of the time. When the pain and suffering
gets to be too much, they quit in droves.
<p>
In fact, even the 12-Step-oriented treatment centers demand that their
clients, both inpatient and outpatient, just quit their addictions on
Day One of the treatment program, before they have gotten any
&quot;treatment&quot;, or done the 12 Steps. How can the clients
possibly do that if they are &quot;powerless&quot;, and suffering from
a &quot;loss of control&quot;, and in desperate need of &quot;treatment&quot;?
<p>
Then the author wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Addiction comprises three stages: preoccupation/anticipation, binge/intoxication, and withdrawal/negative affect, in which impulsivity often dominates at the early stages, and compulsivity dominates at terminal stages. As an individual moves from impulsivity to compulsivity, a shift occurs from positive reinforcement driving the motivated behavior to negative reinforcement driving the motivated behavior (Koob, 2004).<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a rather high-falutin way of saying that first we take drugs because it feels
really good, and then we end up taking drugs because it feels really bad when we don't.
<p>
Then he talked about how to turn lab rats into dopers, and how to make
them &quot;relapse&quot; by putting them through withdrawal and then
shooting them up with more dope. They call that &quot;Drug-induced reinstatement&quot;.
The poor rats.
<p>
Then the author talked about &quot;Stress-induced reinstatement&quot;, which means that you torment an
ex-addict rat until the stress makes him seek a pain-killing hit of dope.
<p>
Then the author stated that this was what he was really writing about:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

The thesis of this review is that a key element of the addiction process involves a profound interaction with brain stress systems and dysregulation of brain antistress systems to produce the negative emotional state that becomes the powerful motivation for drug seeking associated with compulsive use in the withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation (craving) stages of the addiction cycle. Chronic use of drugs of abuse has long been associated with exaggerated responses to stressors, and these exaggerated responses contribute to addiction (Himmelsbach, 1941). Delineation of key elements of not only hormonal but also brain stress neurocircuits have laid the foundation for new insights into the pathophysiology of addiction.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is not a &quot;new insight&quot;. People have known for centuries
that when someone is all stressed out, he is likely to take a drink or
drug to feel better.
Millions of people reach for a cigarette as soon as they feel stressed or nervous.
We also know that when opiate addicts quit their addictions, they are
even more sensitive to pain than they were before they started using drugs.
That really does make quitting tough.

<p>

Then the author gave us an instructional lecture about the brain chemicals involved in
stress. That's nice. That would get an 'A' as a high school term paper. Lots of big
long words and fancy chemical names.
<p>
Then the author said the one really intelligent thing in the whole paper:
&quot;Avoid stress while you are recovering from an addiction.&quot;
Of course we already knew that.  One of the few really valid pieces of
advice that I got when I was quitting drinking and smoking ten years
ago was &quot;Avoid stress, and learn how to deal with stress, and how
to minimize stress, so that it doesn't make you flip out and relapse.&quot;
And several of the sobriety how-to books that I've read said the same thing.
So that advice is nothing new.
<p>
I notice that this paper was funded by the U.S. Government (in 2009).
If this is the level of &quot;research&quot; into addictions that the
government is doing, then I don't expect any help from them. 
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Congratulations to the people of Egypt. Eighteen days of non-violent protests,
and they have shoved out a dictator. And congratulations to the Egyptian Army
for keeping it from turning into a bloodbath.
(Yes, I understand that about 75 people were killed, but that number is dwarfed by
what could have happened. The Chinese Army killed 900 at Tianenmen Square.)
<p>
And congratulations to President Obama, who played it cool but kept up the pressure

<p>

Hello Bob,
<p>
Thank you for the link. That is good, really good. First off, the author is
Maia Szalavitz. I've been reading her stuff for about 10 years now, ever since
I discovered that she exists. She is what I would call &quot;a friend of the sane&quot;.
She is a vocal critic of 12-Step quackery, even though she soft-pedals the
criticism of 12-Step recovery in this article (I would guess that is the price
of getting published in TIME magazine).

<p>
Maia also wrote a book a few years ago, 
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Szalavitz2" target="_blank">Help at Any Cost</i></a>.

There, she took up the thread of the web page
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank"><i>Children's Gulags: Child Abuse for Fun and Profit</i></a>
and took it much further. She traveled the country and did face-to-face interviews
with principle characters in the criminal enterprise called &quot;tough love&quot;
&quot;boot camps&quot; and &quot;youth rehabilitation&quot; facilities.
<p>
Also see
<a href="orange-letters160.html#Szalavitz" target="_blank">Maia's reporting on Straight</a>.

<p>
This TIME magazine article makes some good points, like that putting mere beginners
at dope and alcohol in with hard-core old addicts just gives the kids an education in
drugs and alcohol. It is exactly the same phenomenon as putting kids in prison, where
they will get a 4-year college course in crime from the old pros, and come out as
hardened, skilled, criminals. But of course. How could it be otherwise?

<p>
There is also the problem of labeling kids &quot;addicts&quot;. A teenager who has just been
messing around with drugs or alcohol for a while is not an addict. And addict is somebody
whose body is so habituated to a chemical that he goes into physical withdrawal without it.

<p>
What you think you are tends to be what you will become. Convincing kids that they are
addicts can make them into addicts. Convincing them that they are low, vile, selfish sinners
without any morality can make them behave like that.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

i just read your ravings about AA. i am not sure what you are saying at all. it
seems like a lot of anger just put to the pen. i will keep going to meetings to help
others when i can. i have not had to go to through any steps i did not want to go
through. years ago i just sat at an old man's kitchen table and we would talk, drink
coffee, and have other visitors stop by sometimes. we all just talked, it all came
out, we learned how to be friends, and how to have a conversation with others.
if you were to look up information on personality disorders you will find the
symptons match the character defects we talk about all the time. we have a mild form
of mental illness that often leads to alcohol abuse. we also for some strange reason
suffer from a compulsion to drink like a normal person. we become to fixed on that
we will die trying to. no one understands that strange mental obsession. if one ate
something that bad for him he would not have a problem avoiding it, even if it was
the popular favorite here- home made vegetable soup.

<p>
take a walk down by the river. let it slide. that is what we used to say in the old
hippy days- let it slide man. or, let it ride man. lots less chaos and drama then.
life was easy, fun, and we could trust one another for the most part.

let it slide man. if they are doing their best then what else could they do. if you
do not want to be a part of it, then don't.

Hello Boba,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Starting at the top, it does not matter whether I &quot;have a resentment&quot;,
or whether I am angry. That might affect the tone of my writing style, but it
does not change the facts of the matter. My &quot;having a resentment&quot; will not increase or
decrease the A.A. failure rate.
<p>
Then you advised, &quot;Let it slide.&quot; Let what slide? Foisting an old cult religion on sick
people and calling it &quot;spiritual principles&quot;? Lying to those sick people
about how well A.A. works as a cure (or not a cure, but a &quot;solution&quot;)
to alcohol addiction? Lying to sick people about the actual history of Alcoholics Anonymous?
How about
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the raping of underage girls
in A.A. groups around the country</a>? Am I supposed to
just &quot;let it slide&quot; and pretend that it isn't happening?

<p>
The fact that you had some pleasant conversations with a few people who drink too much
does not fix Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
You are right about the fact that many people who go to Alcoholics Anonymous suffer
from mental illness. See this Cult Test item:<br>
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers" target="_blank">42. Disturbed Members, Mentally Ill Followers.</a><br>
A study of Alcoholics Anonymous members found that they ranged from merely neurotic all the
way up to psychotic. So are you a psychiatrist? When did you get a medical degree? Are
you really qualified to treat mental illness?

From:  	&quot;Adele&quot;<br>
Subject:  	your take on AA<br>


<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
I came upon your writings about AA and was struck by how much time and trouble
you've put into them. You have obviously read AA literature and observed the
functioning of AA meetings closely, which is what I wish everyone would do before
criticizing any philosophy.

<p>
I have met many crazy people in AA. Also in churches, the workplace, theatre groups.
I don't think AA has any more or less crazy people than the rest of society. There
most definitely are angry, negative, and self-hating people in AA. And in the rest
of the world!

<p>
I too have a problem with anyone anywhere who believes their own hype or acts the
guru. I think any intelligent person wanting to recover from alcoholism can
recognize that Bill W &amp; Dr Bob can't have been perfect &#8212; they were human; also
white, Protestant, middle-class American men in a certain time in history, and their
attitudes and beliefs reflect that.

<p>
However, that doesn't make them evil, nor everything they ever said nonsense. I
think you can turn any philosphy into a weapon to attack yourself with, if you're so
inclined, just as you can use it to enhance your life and change a negative outlook
to a positive one.

<p>
I have experienced only positive effects on my life from AA membership of many
years. However, I do know, from long-term observation, that not everyone has that
experience, and it's certainly not their fault. AA is not for everyone. The program
has a heavy Christian slant, Bill W's writings reflect his personal opinions, he was
by no means a perfect person, etc. The program puts heavy emphasis on finding a
Higher Power. Anyone who finds these aspects too objectionable will not want to be
involved with AA. Why should they?

<p>
There are indeed some treatment centers that let themselves be perceived as
&quot;AA-sanctioned&quot; or sponsored treatment centers. This is deceptive on the part of
those places, because AA does not affiliate itself with anything. Anyone who's
angered by having AA forced on them by a treatment center should know that this not
AA's policy at all. Also, it's absurd that some courts think it's a good idea to
&quot;sentence&quot; people to go to AA meetings for a proscribed period. If AA could stop
this practice, it certainly would. How could anyone benefit from a philosophy levied
on them as a punishment?

<p>
This is the USA, and I most vehemently support free speech. You are absolutely
legally and morally entitled to your opinion, and I respect that yours is an
informed one. I just want to know WHY you put so much time and effort into writing
such a large volume of criticism of AA. What is your goal? If your opinion of AA is
that it's all evil, dangerous garbage, and a waste of time... why are you wasting
your time writing about it at such length? Why aren't you spending your time writing
about other things that you think are the opposite, that you believe in and think
are beneficial? Rather than just express rage, why not put out something positive? I
really think that would help everyone out here a lot more than just fanning the
flames of anger at imperfect people, philosphies, and institutions.

<p>
Yours most respectfully,

<p>
Adele D.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Adele,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Starting at the top, I do not stereotype A.A. members and declare that they are all bad.
In fact, I have an affectionate term for the sane ones who go to meetings to help
the newcomers:
&quot;<a href="orange-letters168.html#NRL" target="newwin939">The Newcomer Rescue League</a>&quot;.
The idea is that the sane ones will save newcomers from the bad sponsors.
(Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that way, but that's the idea.)

<p>
It does not matter whether 12-Step-oriented treatment centers are &quot;officially sanctioned&quot;,
or endorsed by the A.A. headquarters. I know that the headquarters in New York does
not endorse any treatment center, although they come very, very close to it with
Hazelden.
The fact remains that we still have many thousands of treatment centers all over the
country who are selling 12-Step cult religion as a quack cure for alcohol addiction and drug
addiction.
<p>

&quot;The program has a heavy Christian slant...&quot;</font><br>
No! It does not. Absolutely not. Alcoholics Anonymous is
positively anti-Christian, and grossly heretical.
If you talk about Jesus too much at a meeting, someone will
invariably interrupt (cross-talk is allowed) and say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Take it to church! If I wanted to hear that
garbage I'd go to church!&quot;</font>
We were just discussing that in a previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters217.html#no_Jesus" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Also read
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a> to see how
much A.A. is not Christian, or slanted towards Christianity.
The A.A. philosophy is very much in conflict with Christian philosophy.

<p>
Then you engaged in a little
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a>:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Bill W's writings reflect his personal opinions, he was
by no means a perfect person, etc.&quot;</font><br>
Actually, Bill W's writing are considered the &quot;holy scriptures&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous.
You begin every A.A. meeting by reading plastic-laminated copies of his lies from pages
58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>.
I agree that Bill was not a perfect person. Nor was he a spiritual person, or a holy man.
He was a lying criminal who used and exploited the people around him.
But he is the man who made Alcoholics Anonymous what it is.

<p>
Then you revealed one of the key characteristics of the Alcoholics Anonymous philosophy:
<font color="black">
The program puts heavy emphasis on finding a
Higher Power. Anyone who finds these aspects too objectionable will not want to be
involved with AA. Why should they?</font><br>
That is pure
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Buchmanism</a>.
Why must it be a &quot;Higher Power&quot;? Adolf Hitler was a higher power.
So was Frank Buchman. So are Satan, Beelzebub, and Lucifer.
<p>
Why can't your Power be an Inner Power? Oh, because
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Kurtz" target="_blank">
Ernest Kurtz yammers about &quot;You are not God&quot;</a>, and you cannot use your own
inner strength as your Power. &quot;The alcoholics must understand that
<a href="orange-letters164.html#not_God" target="_blank"><i>they themselves are not God!</i></a>&quot;

The A.A. &quot;Higher Power&quot; must be Something outside of yourself,
so that you are groveling before Somebody Else. You cannot be self-reliant.
A.A. teaches that
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_reliance" target="_blank">Self-Reliance is bad</a>.&quot;
<p>
Please notice that when courts sentence people to A.A. meetings, they don't bother to
ask whether someone wants to join a religion that worships an external &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
<p>
When you say,
<font color="black">
&quot;Anyone who finds these aspects too objectionable will not want to be
involved with AA. Why should they?&quot;</font>,
you are revealing that Alcoholics Anonymous really is a religion.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you don't want
to believe what we believe, then don't come to our church.&quot;</font><br>
There are plenty of coerced people, sentenced to A.A. meetings, who would love to take
you up on the offer of not going to A.A.
<p>
Besides which, what happened to
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's line about</a>,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.
All of its Twelve Steps are but suggestions.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 26.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
My goal is to get the truth out there, and let people know what they are getting into
if they decide to try the 12-Step routine as a solution to a problem.
<p>
Then you asked,
<font color="black">
&quot;Why aren't you spending your time writing
about other things that you think are the opposite, that you believe in and think
are beneficial?&quot;</font><br>
Oh, I do. Look here:

Hello Todd,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. That's an interesting allegory.
(I can't praise it too much, as it's praising me.)
The line that made me laugh was,
&quot;...as your new found friends tended the weeds around you with Miracle-Grow&reg;&quot;.
So true.
<p>
Have a good day now.
