<p>
Re your message : http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters266.html#Steve_S

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Steve,
<p>
I only have to comment on a few of those lines:


</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
1. So it was a fight over who got to own and chant to the oldest scroll? Incredible.
</font>

<p>
No, we didn't fight for it. The priesthood effectively took the Dai Gohonzon
hostage. They told SGI members that unless they left the SGI and destroyed their SGI
Gohonzon that they would not have access to the Dai Gohonzon.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Still, there was an implication that one scroll was more magical than another.
That is not Buddhism. That is some kind of occult belief.
<p>
And that kind of magical thinking easily extends itself to having holy relics
like &quot;pieces of the True Cross&quot; and &quot;dried Virgin Mother's milk&quot;
and &quot;The Shroud&quot;, and things like that. 
<p>
One thing that I think we agree on is the fact that the magic is within you, not in inanimate objects.

</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
2.) I can just see a Zen Buddhist master burning the scroll while asking, &quot;What were
you idiots thinking?&quot;
</font>

<p>
A Zen Buddhist master may well do something like that. Zen buddhism is not based on
any of Shakyamuni's transmissions, but that's another argument.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't think that chanting to a scroll is part of Buddha's teachings, either.

</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
3.) I can't help but notice the parallels to what happened to Christianity. After
existing for several hundred years, Christianity had turned into an organization
that excommunicated people, had heresy trials, and burned girls at the stake as
witches, and burned astronomers as heretics.
</font>

<p>
Unfortunately, this is what happens when priests and egos get involved &#8212; which is
why we don't have any!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Good luck with that one.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
4.) I can see some sense in the belief that to improve oneself is to improve the
world. Still, I find chanting for the happiness of others a stretch, and perhaps a
bit of ego: &quot;I'm so good that I chant for the happiness of others.&quot;
</font>

<p>
If I made you happy in some way, then you have to accept that gives me great
pleasure. I desire no recognition &#8212; only that you consider what I have said. Some
people enjoy the idea of having others dependant upon them. Again, this is incorrect
thinking.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
5.) My group leader thought I was nuts when I talked about getting enlightenment.
Why do that when you can get the good stuff?
</font>

<p>
That is truly misguided.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
6.) Ah, but does chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo &quot;activate your Buddha nature?&quot; That is
a huge assumption.
</font>

<p>
It's a japanese translation of chinese, based on original sanskrit... I guess we
could be chanting &quot;rice krispies&quot;... It is the intention behind and understanding of
the full theoretical and essential meaning of the daimoku that allows it to have
greater effect. Of course, the reason I previously said that I believe simply
chanting it without knowing all this will still help, is because it is rare for
people to come across the mantra without having it first explained to them even in
the most simple terms. But yes, there is a faith element there (back to the tooth
fairy argument)

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
7.) Alas, I remain skeptical. There was a lot more going on at the meetings that I
attended. Like subtle pressure to conform and believe in their superstitions. They
were constantly selling the practice: &quot;Just try it. Just chant for 30 days, and if
it doesn't work for you, we will all quit.&quot; They didn't quit when I did.
</font>

<p>
I can understand your doubt &#8212; It would appear you were exposed to the most
despicable slander of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, that's what it was in the USA in 1971.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
8.) Ah yes, that is the key question, isn't it? Does it actually work? And work to
do what, exactly? Phrases like &quot;activate your Buddha-nature&quot; are so vague and
high-falutin' that they could mean anything.
</font>

<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
It is the essential question! It works for me (and I'm the greatest of doubting
Thomas's) and for millions of other people. It is the most comprehensive method for
connecting on a fundamental level with humanity.

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;It works&quot;? What works? And what does it do?
<p>
You know that I am extremely skeptical about this one. My web site constantly gets letters
from A.A. members who insist that practicing an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties
and praying to the Big Dictator in the Sky &quot;really works&quot;.
It's so easy for people to delude themselves, and see whatever they wish to see.
And of course
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">observational selection</a> kicks in.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Step Eleven suggests prayer and meditation. We shouldn't be shy on this
matter of prayer. Better men than we are using it constantly.

<p>

<p>

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 100.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whether chanting or praying &quot;works&quot; is entirely subjective.
And what it is supposed to do is undefined.

</font>
<p>
Phrases like &quot;activate your Buddha-nature&quot; only sound vague and high-falutin' when
taken out of context, and without the necessary study to understand what they really
imply. However, they are not euphemisms for the negative aspects of life &#8212; unlike
other high-falutin' terms we hear every day.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
9.) Sounds good. But will that glorious day ever come? Most of Buddha's teachings
said &quot;no&quot;. Buddha said that suffering would never end, and this world would never
become Paradise.
</font>

<p>
The original Buddha, Shakyamuni often describes this &quot;saha&quot; world in the Pre Lotus
teachings. Saha meaning suffering, enduring etc... However, the Lotus Sutra, which
the Buddha revealed towards the end of his life after delivering more than 40 years
of provisional (or expedient) teachings, reveals that it is this very world that is
also the realm of tranquil light in which the Buddha's (us) dwell. If you remember
your meetings you may recall part of gongyo as reciting part of the Life Span
chapter. It is this very passage where Shakyamuni establishes that in fact, it is
this world, not some other ghostly realm, where we achieve Buddhahood, and thus turn
into the Land of Tranquil Light. This is clearly documented in the Lotus, and
covered by T'ien T'ai, Dengyo and later propagated by the Daishonin in Japan.

<p>
<font color="blue">
About &quot;the realm of tranquil light&quot;:<br>
Yes, we either achieve enlightenment in this world or not at all. And some fortunate souls are
able to change their own reality to make it like heaven on earth. But I think that for
all of the other
people, this world stays pretty much the same. Or they continue to maintain their own version of reality,
their own private heaven or hell or usually something inbetween.
It isn't like the whole planet suddenly becomes Paradise,
like some Christians imagine will happen when Jesus returns.
<p>
At least, I don't expect this planet to become Heaven for at least 10 or 15 billion more years.
After that, all bets are off, because the Sun might super-nova.


</font>
<p>
Orange &#8212; You clearly have a seeking spirit, and you clearly feel great doubt and
suspicion towards the SGI. All this is understandable given your experience. The
people you encountered have destroyed your faith in Buddhism, and this is a most
awful cause in their lives. I urge you to maintain a connection with the Lotus
Sutra. If you want find out more, and have time to listen, try abuddhistpodcast.com
 &#8212; it's down to earth and gives you some idea of how the SGI really fosters happiness
and potential in it's members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The &quot;Nichiren Shoshu&quot; guys that I was involved with in Colorado
did not &quot;destroy my faith in Buddhism&quot;.
I do not consider them to be Buddhists. They didn't practice anything like Buddhism. I couldn't even
get a straight answer to the simplest questions like,
&quot;Where are Buddha's teachings? What about the 8-Fold Path?&quot;. Nothing.
It was all, &quot;Just chant. Chant more. And more. Chant for what you want.&quot;
That isn't Buddhism. That is a strange cult
that just chants all of the time, and believes that they can make a scroll give them things if they
chant to it enough.

<p>
It's just like the crazy &quot;Christian&quot; cults that you find in
the USA who don't practice anything like Christianity.  Here in Portland we have 
<a href="orange-letters265.html#Followers" target="_blank">the Followers of Christ Church</a> people who
kill their children by refusing to take them to a doctor and get medical care when the kids are sick.
They only believe in faith healing. Every few years they kill another kid.
Those nutcases do not diminish the teachings of Jesus. They just show how crazy some people can be.

<p>
Have a great week &#8212; I have to go to work now!

For those of you being victimized by AA in New York state, here is an e-mail from
someone REQUESTING COMPLAINTS to be sent to the NY Attorney General's office! She
only wants 10-20, but I think a few more can be had then that. Download, complete

Hi Orange,

<p>
Can you please post the attached to the &quot;OP-Forum&quot; (I made reference to these
&quot;unedited&quot; &quot;Anti-Coercion, 12-Steps&quot; in an earlier posting (now buried DEEP
somewhere within it, since your forum has EXPLODED in postings, and members, etc!),
and now have them to &quot;post accordingly!

<p>
Also, nauseating as it is-I would like to send you my copy of the AAWS produced
&quot;Hope&quot; DVD (16:22-produced in 2009). I figured you could put it on either or both of
the web-sites (with appropriate commentary of course! ;). I have shown the damn
thing so many times in my DUI groups, its &quot;skipping&quot; now! (I am no longer going to
show it, as I have a better DVD from Secular Organizations for Sobriety (&quot;The
Sobriety Priority&quot;) to show the clients. They already get enough 12-Step
indoctrination by not having NON-local meetings to go to!

<p>
Have a great day!

I'm not sure about posting pictures to the forum either. I have to figure that one out.

<p>
Very interesting,
You would be welcome in AA. The only requirement for membership is a desire
to stop drinking.
You don't have to pay anything, say anything, believe anything, do anything.
In fact you can come to AA
and disagree with everything there and you're still a member if you say so.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Graham,
<p>
No, actually there are other requirements. You have to be gullible, and open to indoctrination,
and ready to accept A.A. as your new master. We just discussed the prerequisites in
<a href="orange-letters266.html#prerequisites" target="_blank">a previous letter, here</a>.
<p>
And here is what Bill Wilson had to say on the subject:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Let's look first at the case of the one who says he won't believe &#8212; the belligerant one.
He is in a state of mind which can be only described as savage. His whole philosophy of life,
in which he so gloried, is threatened. It's bad enough, he thinks, to admit alcohol has him down
for keeps. But now, still smarting from that admission, he is faced with something really impossible.
How he does cherish the thought that man, risen so majestically from a single cell in the primordial
ooze, is the spearhead of evolution and therefore the only god that his universe knows! Must he
renounce all this to save himself?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At this juncture, his A.A. sponsor usually laughs. This, the newcomer thinks, is just about the
last straw. This is the beginning of the end.
And so it is: the beginning of the end of his old life, and the beginning of his emergence into a
new one. His sponsor probably says, &quot;Take it easy. The hoop you have to jump through is a lot
wider than you think. At least I've found it so. So did a friend of mine who was a one-time
vice-president of the American Atheist Society, but he got through with room to spare.&quot;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Well,&quot; says the newcomer, &quot;I know you're telling me the truth. It's no doubt a fact that A.A.
is full of people who once believed as I do. ...&quot;<br>

<p>
By the way,
<a href="orange-letters88.html#American_Atheist" target="_blank">
there was no such thing as the &quot;American Atheist Society&quot; in existence at that time</a>.
Bill Wilson was just making up lies again.
(Click on that link.)

</font>
<p>
I live in South Africa and have never been to a meeting other than here.
Maybe one day the truth will out. I have never heard religion preached in
any meeting I've been to.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because you have not seen something does not
prove that it does not exist.
<p>
Besides, you have seen it. You are <i>in denial</i>.
Don't your meeting groups read the 12 Steps out loud at the
start of every meeting? Six of the 12 Steps talk about God. That is a cult religion.
It is
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman's cult religion</a>,
in fact.
Not even hard-core Christian churches start every church service by reading the 10 Commandments
out loud. But A.A. does  &#8212;  their 12 Commandments, that is.

<p>
A religious cult is definitely something I would not belong to. However I
accept your right to judge me and
all AA members. However, there is a God and it's not you, thank God.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Cult members never say that they are in a cult.
They do not recognize that they are in a cult. They just think that <i>those other
people</i> are in cults.  If they do realize that they are in a cult,
it's over  &#8212;  their eyes have opened and the little light bulb
went on in their heads, and they will soon quit the cult.

</font>
<p>
You will go on your merry way crusading in the name of your religious cult
and I will happily go on my way
telling people about my sobriety.

<p>
<font color="blue">
In all fairness to the sick people, also remember to tell them about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">all of the people
whom A.A. did not help, or made worse</a>.
Or

Bill Wilson and Dr Bob are not AA. They were two alcoholics. AA is and has
always been one alcoholic
talking to another in order to reduce their feelings of being different in a
world that has always left us feeling
frightened and alone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Of course Saint Bill and Saint Bob are A.A. Whose pictures are on the wall in the meeting rooms?
Whose words are read out loud at the start of every A.A. meeting? Whose books are read at
meetings? You know, the &quot;council-approved literature&quot;?
Whose insane rants and ravings are the official A.A. &quot;program&quot;?

<p>
Yes, Saint Bill and Saint Bob sure do get their pictures on the wall a lot.
<br>
(See a discussion of that picture <a href="orange-letters201.html#Bob_O" target="_blank">here</a>.)
<p>
There are more such pictures, and another discussion of how
<a href="orange-letters267.html#reverence" target="_blank">&quot;Bill Wilson isn't worshipped with reverence&quot;,
here</a>.

<p>
By the way, the claim that A.A. isn't really about Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob is another standard
A.A. bait-and-switch trick:


<ul>
<p><li>
First, the real A.A. is what Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob created. They are considered
the Saints of A.A., and their teachings are allegedly <i>The Message From God</i>.
A.A. members reverently read <i>As Bill Sees It</i> out loud at meetings.
<p><li>
But then, when you point out
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">what sick insane men Bill Wilson
and Dr. Bob really were</a>,
the A.A. promoters claim that the A.A. program is the 12 Steps and the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out what insane Buchmanite nonsense is in <i>the Book</i>,
and how
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
the 12 Steps are really just the cult practices of Dr. Frank Buchman</a>,
then the &quot;real A.A.&quot; is <i>The Fellowship</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out how many
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">con artists, psychopaths</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">rapists</a>
make up the Fellowship, they claim that the real A.A. is the teachings of Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob.
</ul>
<p>
Baloney. It's all really A.A.

I have had fun corresponding with you and just as you have the right to
continue your crusade, I have the right
to laugh at myself because the more I can laugh at myself, the more I can
find my worth.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So laugh at yourself. Or pretend to. That still doesn't help alcoholics.
</font>
<p>
I could say you're arrogant, self-righteous, self justifying etc. In fact
you are. But never mind, you remind me of
a TV evangelist. Whenever I need a comedy show, I watch them in action. You
make me laugh, not angry or resentful.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A TV evangelist? Do I tell you that you must believe what I say, and
send me your money, or else God won't like you and you will go to Hell?
Do I tell you to ignore the facts and just believe?

</font>
<p>
You live in your shoes, I live in mine and surely if I tell you that I am
happy, you should be happy for me instead of telling me
why I can't be happy if I'm a member of AA. If you concentrate on the human
beings like Bill, Bob, Buchman and so on,
you will only find human failings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well A.A. and 12-Step-promoting counselors say that A.A. works great, not that it is a catalogue of
human failings.

</font>
<p>
As always, I genuinely wish you well. I have no fight with you. You cannot
insult me however hard you may try and I am free.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I am not trying to insult you. I'm interested in telling the truth about A.A. so that desperate,
sick, people know what their choices are.

Carp eating pastry.
</center>
<p>
That brown and white lump is some old pastry that I fed to the carp.
<p>
Those guys are really something else. They have a feeding frenzy when you throw bread to them.
There are a lot of really big carp in the ponds.

<p>
I even saw one carp climb up out of the water to get a piece of bread that was on the shore,
and then turn around and crawl back into the water.
I couldn't believe it when I first saw it. My reaction was, &quot;Wow! Darwin's Evolution in action.&quot;
<p>
That answered a big question that I always had: &quot;Why would the fish
want to crawl up out of the ocean in the first place?&quot;
<p>
Now, the answer is obvious: to get more food. The plants came ashore first,
and then the insects. The plants came ashore because there was more territory to colonize,
lots of available space and sunlight,
and then the insects came ashore because there were plants to eat.
Then, there those fish were, looking up at all of that
tasty food just on the other side of the surface of the water, just out
of reach. Finally, some fish got the idea of climbing up there and getting
the food, and then returning to the water.
<p>
After that, it was just a matter of, the fish that can hold its breath
out of the water the longest gets the most food.
Eventually, some fish even grew lungs so that they could stay out of the water for
a long time. (We even still have some of those fish around. The African Lungfish
is just what it sounds like. And the famous Siamese Fighting Fish &#8212; Bettas &#8212; 
have a small lung in their heads so that they can survive in almost no water, like a mud puddle.)

Hello again, Peter,
<p>
Thanks for your work. You sure are getting a lot of articles published fast.
<p>
That article is particularly touching. I've also seen alcoholics and addicts trying so hard
to do the right thing.
It's doubly and triply hard when you are sick and broke, but some try anyway.

<p>
That isn't what A.A. teaches. Bill Wilson just constantly
attacked what he called
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#practicing" target="_blank">practicing alcoholics</a>&quot;,
and raved about how bad they were, and selfish and stupid and willful.
(Doesn't &quot;practicing alcoholic&quot; sound just like &quot;practicing homosexual&quot;?)

Subject:  	the critical orange papers<br>

<p>
Who are you and just what is your motive for writing such a critical and
unsubstantiated paper regarding AA's beginning?

<p>
I noticed two very distinct patterns in your writing, first, it is dripping with
venom that appears to be more a personal prejudice rather than a reporting of facts.
The second isn't really a pattern in your writing but rather a pattern established
by scoffers and that is that you make no reference to who you are or by what
authority your supposed expertise is derived from.

<p>
While the facts may indeed be near to what you write, because of the two facts
mentioned above your writing must be discounted as mere tripe intended to harm and
discredit an organization that has in fact helped many thousands, possibly millions
of otherwise hopelessly addicted people including myself, lead useful happy lives.
(I am recovered for nearly 32 years without so much as one relapse).

Please check out the book I wrote.Click Here.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Les,
<p>
Well, let's start with your word &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;.
My &quot;paper&quot;, as you call it, is supported
by numerous facts. Read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
There, I quote many doctors, and reference ALL of the valid randomized longitudinal controlled
studies and tests of A.A. that I have been able to find in the last 10 years.
And I think I found them all.
I even quote a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Prof. and Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who found that A.A. treatment did not work to improve the sobriety rate in alcoholics at all, and it
produced the highest death rate of any way of treating alcoholism.
So read that file, and then you can dispute my evidence, and my facts, if you care to.

<p>
The fact that you have been happy in a cult for many years is not evidence that the cult is a
good organization. That only proves that you like the cult.
Tom Cruise says lots of good things about Scientology, too.
And he says that Scientology is the only cure for alcoholism and drug addiction.
Should we believe him? Why not?

<p>
In addition, you are assuming that A.A. has done something good for the sober people. The real
evidence is that some people just finally get sick and tired of being so sick and tired, and
decide that they aren't going to die of alcohol poisoning, so they quit drinking and keep
themselves sober. (Like how I did.)
They sometimes also go to some A.A. meetings to see if A.A. has any help to
offer. Then A.A. steals the credit for their sobriety and claims that
A.A. &quot;helped them&quot;. That is not evidence that A.A. has
&quot;helped many thousands, possibly millions&quot;.

<p>
Please answer this one simple question that no A.A. member has ever answered honestly:

<p>
Agent Orange,
<p>
First let me say I am a big fan of your articles and refer to them often when trying
to reconcile the AA &quot;company line&quot; with the truth. I don't think you are always
correct, I don't think the company line is always correct, but I believe the truth
always lies somewhere in between.
<p>
Secondly let me state I am in no way a member of a cult, I go to AA for the
friendships I have there, to get a few (very few) opinions or views on the
spiritual/religious lifestyle I am trying to live to the best of my abilities, and
that sometimes, rarely, I am of some help to someone struggling to stay sober. I am
self sponsored actually I follow the step guide of Clarence Snyder who as you surely
know was the first &quot;leader&quot; to put the Big Book on the table beside the Good Book,
and claims to have documented a 93% success rate in AA. I don't know that this is
even possible but it gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside lol.I find the more I
research the more that I despise Bill Wilson more and more, for me AA is exactly
what Bob and Clarence meant for it to be a Christ based recovery group. I think my
whole life of pleasing myself and all my whims has been an example of my self-will
run riot, and I always tried to find a reason to get back to the
religion of my youth and AA if nothing else gave me the nudge and excuse to do the
un-macho act of doing just that.
<p>
I have just read Bill's story in its original format and clearly agree that it would
have been completely rewritten to be of any use in the Big Book and almost agree
that he was incapable of writing his name on the bathroom wall..................wait
for it .............................BUT how can the
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve
Traditions</i>,  <i>AA Comes of Age</i>,
 and Bill's many articles to the Grapevine which led
to <i>As Bill Sees It</i>
 all supposedly written by him be explained? I have looked
everywhere I know to including your website and can't find any explanation how a
bumbling idiot who could barely put a sentence together at the beginning of the Big
Book project turned into such an enlightened example of literature later in life
(the sarcasm was dripping off that last statement, I hope you caught it).

<p>
I hope my sentence structure, wording and such are understandable, because I really
don't want to have my e-mail dissected line by line in your response, nor do I want
to debate my personal, very personal beliefs on recovery with you, even though I
know there is no logical explanation to what I believe (sometimes an act of faith is
just that, as insane as that probably seems to most who would read this) I just do.
I also don't want to waste either of our time trying to move each other from either
the right wing or left wing to a blissfully unrealistic center. I think in some
areas we should probably just agree to disagree (even if you have more evidence to
support your argument, I'll just take my ball and go home lol), and agree not to be
disagreeable in the process.

<p>
Anyway keep up the great work I always find something new and thought invoking when
I read your articles and then spend days trying to prove or disprove what you wrote,
and I really look forward to hearing from you thanks,
<p>
Brian F.

<font color="blue">
Hello Brian,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And I won't dissect your letter line by line.
<p>
Apparently you enjoy A.A. membership. So be it.
I won't even knock it. I'm just glad to see that you still have a working brain.
<p>
About the question of authorship: We know that Bill had a lot of help in writing his things.
The story is that Joe Worth helped to write or rewrite <i>Bill's Story</i>.
Susan Smith Windows, Dr. Bob's daughter, said in a sworn affidavit that everything that 
Bill wrote had to be rewritten by other people:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Mr. Henry G. (Hank) Parkhurst, another early member of the NY group
from New Jersey, wrote the outline for the book and at least one
complete chapter (TO EMPLOYERS). An AA historian who is writing Hank
P.'s biography has reported that Bill Wilson's refusal to recognize
him (Hank) as the author of at least that chapter was one of the
precipitating factors in Hank's eventual split with AA. It is my
understanding that Bill Wilson took sole
ownership of the book as copyright holder despite his not being the
author and thus unlawfully copyrighted the book under his own name
on April 10, 1939. The true authors of this book were the members
of the Fellowship. The personal stories were written by individual
members and edited by Jim Scott (an Akron, Ohio member). Bill
Wilson also did not write the first eleven- (11) chapters. He only
wrote a lengthy life story of his own, typed by Ruth Hock. He
included some resentments against Christianity and a report about
what Ebby Thacher told him. This piece was written so poorly, that
it could only be used for the book after Joe Worth, a member of the
NY group and successful professional founder and editor of &quot;NY
Magazine&quot;, had rewritten it entirely.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith" target="_blank">See full text here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
We know that Henry Parkhurst was the unpaid co-author of the opening chapters of
<i>The Big Book</i>. Henry Parkhurst wrote the chapter <i>To Employers</i>, and also his own autobiographical story
<i>The Unbeliever</i>, and &quot;Hank&quot; also wrote the outline for the whole book.
There is no way to know how much else &quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst rewrote or contributed to.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_cheated" target="_blank">Bill Wilson cheated Henry</a>
out of any share of the royalties or credit for that book, and
that's why Henry quit A.A. in disgust.
<p>
We know that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP" target="_blank">Tom Powers was the unpaid co-author
of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i></a>.
Bill Wilson cheated Tom out of any share of the royalties on that book, and
that's why Tom quit A.A. in disgust.
There were also other unrecognized co-authors of 12X12 whose names are unknown.

<p>
I have no idea who was behind the writing of Bill's other stuff.
By the time those other books and articles got written, there was enough office staff at
A.A.W.S. and <i>The Grapevine</i> offices to do a lot of rewriting.

<p>
Have a good day now.

The Captain suggested perhaps it would help if the sailors
would change underwear occasionally.

<p>
The first mate responded, &quot;Aye, aye sir, I'll see to it immediately!&quot;

<p>
The first mate went straight to the sailors berth deck and announced, &quot;The Captain
thinks you guys smell bad and wants you to change your underwear.&quot;

<p>
He continued, &quot;Pittman, you change with Jones, McCarthy, you change with Witkowski,
and Brown, you change with Schultz.&quot;

<p>
Scroll  down

<p>
THE MORAL OF THE STORY:

<p>
Someone may come along and promise &quot;Change&quot;,
but don't count on things smelling any better.

<p>
I THINK YOU WILL FORWARD THIS !

Blog note, 20 October 2011:
<p>
Well, here we are again. Anniversary day. Now it's 11 years without a drink. How time flies
when you are goofing off.
This &quot;birthday&quot; isn't
such a big milestone as the 10th one, but it is still evidence that a lot of us are making it without
needing to have a cult religion running our lives. That is, without a &quot;support group&quot;
or a &quot;program&quot;.
<p>
Have you noticed that the number of Steppers who are predicting that I will relapse real soon now has diminished?<br>
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment99" target="_blank">
 &quot;You will still relapse. Somebody with a resentment as big
as yours can't help but go back out.&quot;</a><br>

I'm not hearing that one so much any more... I guess they got tired of waiting.

<p>
And interestingly, the 11th anniversary is &quot;disaster day&quot; for Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">The table of sobriety coins given out</a>
shows a huge drop between 10 and 11 years. The percentage of A.A. newcomers
finally getting a 10-year coin was really bad at only a pathetic 1.17%,
but 11 years was even worse: only 0.76% got the 11-year coin.
That looks like a loss of one third of their old-timers between 10 and 11 years.
No A.A. supporter has ever explained that oddity.

<p>
One reader suggested that the number of people getting 10-year coins was really inflated by people picking
up multiple 10-year coins. Some A.A. members are so proud of themselves for making it for 10 years that they
drive all over town, going to one meeting after another, and picking up another coin so that
they can hear the crowd cheering for them again and again. That is probably true.
<p>
But somehow, 11 years doesn't seem to have the same glitter or pizzaz,
so they don't bother doing that again.
So at 11 years, we see a really appalling lack of success stories.

<p>
Hey, guess what? It looks like I just entered the ranks of the &quot;One Percenters&quot;.
(Just kidding.)
 
<p>
Have a good day now.<br>

<p>
P.S.: My 11-year anniversary off of cigarettes is still 3 weeks away, but I was thinking about how many
cigarettes I haven't smoked in the last 11 years, so I grabbed a calculator and did some simple multiplication.
<p>
There are 4017 days in 11 years (including 2 leap year days). And since I was smoking about a pack a day,
that yields 80,340 cigarettes smoked in 11 years.
<p>
Yikes! The thought of smoking 80,000 cigarettes is nauseating. 
<p>
And yet, I smoked for over 30 years, so that is a lot more cigarettes than that. It's a wonder that
any of us ever survived that. The human body is amazingly tough when you come right down to it.
<p>
Have another good day.

Tell your theory to my two dead brothers. I'm alive, why? I wasn't too much
of a pussy to take a good hard look at myself.

<p>
I wonder how many people died by your bullshit

Hello Kathy,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Unfortunately, you left a lot unsaid.
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about the deaths of your brothers. You did not say what they died of, or how.
You just implied that they died because they would not &quot;take a
hard look at themselves&quot; like you say you did.

<p>
&quot;Taking a hard look at yourself&quot; does not require joining a cult religion or foisting ineffective
quack medicine on sick people, and lying to them about how well it works.
In fact, being rigorously honest with yourself works far better if you don't join a cult religion.
Then you don't have to tell lies in defense of the cult.

<p>
I have always said that about half of the alcoholics get a grip and quit drinking and save their
own lives, and the other half don't. That is just how it is, and no &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;program&quot;
changes that.
<p>
You have presented no evidence or facts to support your allegation that my statements about
Alcoholics Anonymous are &quot;bullshit&quot;. Do you have any facts to contradict mine? Or do you just have a resentment?

<p>
How many people have died because of the Alcoholics Anonymous bullshit and misinformation
and fallacies about alcohol abuse and recovery? Dr. George E. Vaillant, 
who went on to become a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., reported that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. caused a higher death
rate than any other way of treating alcoholism</a>. What about that?

<p>
By the way, the accusation that telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous causes alcoholics to
die is a very old dodge that A.A. is forever using. I have
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="_blank">a list of such accusations here</a>.
<p>
Have a good day now.

I feel sorry for you that you have so much anger toward a program that works
beautifully for so many (those willing to truly look at themselves, which is
something I am assuming you would not do- too scared of what you might see).. My
only question for you is, were you drinking the entire time you were writing this
article?  Only an angry alcoholic would spend the absurd amount of time I am certain
it took to compile all of your 'evidence' that AA is a cult. I love how the majority
of your quotes from AA literature and the like were taken completely out of context.
I hope you hit your bottom soon and become willing to do something about your
alcoholism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Amy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Alas, Alcoholics Anonymous does not &quot;work beautifully for so many&quot;.
A.A. has a sky-high failure rate, and an appalling death rate.
A.A. just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raises the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">raises the cost of hospitalizing alcoholics</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
A.A. pretends to be a solution to the problem of alcohol abuse, but it isn't.
Doing the 12 Steps and confessing all of your sins is not a cure for alcohol addiction.
<p>
I was not drinking while I wrote any of the Orange Papers. In fact, coincidentally, today is my eleventh
&quot;birthday&quot; off of alcohol. Yes, 11 years of sobriety, as of today. And I did it without any
cult religion or doing
<a href="orange-rroot030.hmtl" target="_blank">the 12 Steps to Buchmanism</a>,
or worshipping Bill Wilson, or participating in a cult religion.

<p>
Once again, we have another A.A. true believer claiming that someone must be &quot;angry&quot; to tell the
truth about Alcoholics Anonymous. That is just such a common hackneyed old line that A.A.
members are forever using to dodge the important issues.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment99" target="_blank">See the list of such accusations here</a>.
<p>
You have not addressed any of the big problems with Alcoholics Anonymous, you just claim that I must be angry
and drunk to criticize A.A. That isn't much of a defense of A.A.

<p>
You claim that my quotes from Alcoholics Anonymous Council-approved
literature were &quot;taken out of context&quot;.
Please show me even one quote that is taken out of context.

<p>
You do know what it means to
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context" target="_blank">take something out of context</a>&quot;,
don't you?
It means that you deceptively change the meaning of the words by misquoting them, by only partially quoting them.
I don't do that. Again, please show me any quote where I changed the meaning of the words
by taking something out of context.
I don't do that.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Who are you? Why are you so angry? Why waste so much time attacking anything. I
could literally feel the hate in you. Is there anything better you could do like
spread love. become conscious.  This material I read brought me back to high school
days. Meaningless and sad.

<p>
I hope you find what you're looking for. you may want to start by looking inward
rather than outreach.

Hello Zanon,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. When it rains, it pours. Yours is the second letter in a row to come
from an A.A. true believer who accuses me of being angry and having a resentment.
(<a href="orange-letters268.html#Amy_T" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)

<p>
It does not matter whether I am angry or have a resentment. That does not change the horrible
Alcoholics Anonymous failure rate. Nor does it make any of the A.A. lies and misinformation come true.

<p>
I am telling the truth about A.A., and alcoholism, and recovery, because somebody has to tell the
truth to the sick people who need to hear the truth about what might help them.

<p>
I am spreading love and consciousness. By telling the truth.
<p>
If you think I'm not telling the truth, then please answer this one simple question that no A.A.
member has ever answered honestly:

Or even several years later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
