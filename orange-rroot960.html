Bufe, Charles, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?</i>, 1998,
2nd edition.<br>
The reference to the son of an inner circle member stating that it was an
open secret that Frank Buchman was a homosexual comes from the second
edition of the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?</i>, by Charles Bufe.
After Bufe published the first edition of the book, that son in question
contacted Bufe and gave him that information to answer one of Bufe's questions
about Buchman's behavior. See page 28.

Buchman never recanted, but the Buchmanites did later deny that the
whole thing ever happened &#8212; that Buchman had ever praised Hitler.
But books written at the time disagree with them. See
<i>They Have Found A Faith</i>, by Marcus Bach, page 126.

<p>
<a name="Niebuhr"> </a>
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#Niebuhr_ret">14) Reinhold Niebuhr</a>: The thing about Niebuhr that
A.A. and N.A. members will immediately recognize is
<i><b>The Serenity Prayer</b></i>, which he wrote in 1943:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Courier">
&quot;God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that
cannot be changed, courage to change the things which should
be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the
other.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps you noticed the fact that, yes, the early A.A. members who adopted Niebuhr's
prayer also misquoted and mangled it. They turned it into this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Courier">
&quot;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I
cannot change, courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reinhold Niebuhr did not like that
mangling. His daughter explains in her book about her father,
also titled <i>The Serenity Prayer</i>,
that Reinhold Niebuhr disliked reducing the phrase
&quot;courage to change the things which should
be changed&quot; into &quot;courage to change the things I can&quot;, which implies that
A.A. members should just go around changing things without asking whether they
<i>should</i> be changed.

One more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions
or not, they may do well to examine the principles by which the
alcoholic member is trying to live. They can hardly fail to approve
these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails
somewhat in practicing them.
Nothing will help the man who is off on a spiritual tangent so

<a href="orange-rroot810.html#ftnt045_ret">45</a>)
&quot;Broker&quot;: Bill Wilson called himself &quot;a New York
stockbroker&quot; in the Foreword to the Second Edition
of the <i>Big Book</i> (on pages 'xv' through 'xvii' of the 3rd and 4th editions).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That was another of Bill Wilson's gross exaggerations &#8212; a lie, really.
Bill Wilson was never a stock broker or anything like a stock
broker. He was neither trained nor licensed
as a stock broker. He never traded stocks for other people.
He never worked on the New York Stock Exchange or any other exchange either.
Bill never worked for a brokerage firm except for one owned by a friend in
Montreal, where Bill worked for a short while as an investigator or researcher,
studying companies to determine their suitability for investment or speculation
(BB, p.4). Bill didn't last long on that job; he was fired for habitual drunkenness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What Bill Wilson really was is a <i>stock touter</i>,
a man who investigated companies and then recommended certain stocks
to investors and speculators.
When (and if) Bill's recommendations paid off, the grateful speculators
would give some of their profits to Bill.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Touting stocks resembles touting horses at the race track. See the
start of the Abbott and Costello movie <i>The Lemon-Drop Kid</i>
for an example of touting horses...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill Wilson fell in with a gang of stock market &quot;operators&quot; who ran what
Bill mistakenly called &quot;Ponzi schemes&quot;.
They were actually stock market &quot;pump-n-dump&quot; schemes,
where the gang bought up a large block of stock in some inexpensive company, and then hyped it
and promoted it and boosted its price by trading it back and forth between themselves
at ever higher prices so that it appeared, on the ticker tape, like the stock was
&quot;going to the moon&quot;.
Then, when the public was sufficiently excited about the stock, the operators
sold all of the stock, dumping it on the public at a grossly inflated price.
The operators laughed all of the way to the bank, while the public was
left holding stock that rapidly declined in value.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When they did that with General Electric stock, Bill Wilson rationalized that it was
okay because the stock price eventually went back up anyway.
(But Bill did not say that the people who got cheated in the scheme got their money back.)
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One historian called Bill Wilson &quot;a Wall Street hustler&quot;,
which sounds like a far more accurate description of Bill's
relationship to the stock market than &quot;stock broker&quot;.<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Narcissistic Legends [in Their Own Minds] can tell wonderful stories about the great
things they've done in the past. Often, the stories are huge exaggerations.
Always check.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Emotional Vampires: Dealing with People Who Drain You Dry</i>,
Albert J. Bernstein, Ph.D., page 149.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Note that Bill's successful
period on Wall Street was during the giddy bubble of the 1920s
when everything was going up with &quot;irrational exhuberance&quot;.
The investing pundits say that anybody can pick winners in a
rapidly-rising bull market when everything is going up.
It's picking winners during a grim,
declining bear market that separates the men from the boys.
After the stock market crash of 1929, Bill's game was over.

Walter Houston Clark was a very interesting person in his own right.
He was a professor of the psychology of religion at Andover Newton
Theological School in Massachutsetts and a dean at Hartford
Seminary. He also taught at Andover Newton in Newton Centre near
Boston from 1962 until his retirement in 1969. Before that,
he was dean of the School of Religious Education at the seminary.
Before that, he also taught at Bowdoin College and Middlebury
College.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Early on, Clark became interested in Frank Buchman and his Oxford Group
when he attended a revival meeting led by Buchman.
Clark developed a lifelong interest in understanding the
significance of religious experience as distinct from belief.
That interest led to his writing the book <i>The Oxford Group:
Its History and Significance</i>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The <i>New York Times</i> reported in Clark's obituary:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He explored the importance that mystical experience can have in
religion, which led to an association with Dr. Timothy Leary and
others who advocated the use of hallucinogens to expand their
consciousness. In the early 1960's, Dr. Clark took part in
religious ceremonies in which peyote, mescaline and similar
hallucinogens were taken.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He spoke out for people arrested for using LSD and other
hallucinogenic substances for what they said were solely
religious purposes.<br>

The book <i>Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</i>
was a fraud &#8212; See:
<i>A Rumor About The Jews; Reflections on Antisemitism and the
<b>Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</b></i>,
by Stephen Eric Bronner, especially pages 83 to 88.<br>
Also see: <i>A Doomsday Reader; Prophets, Predictors, and Hucksters of
Salvation</i>, edited by Ted Daniels.  Includes a chapter on the
<i>&quot;Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;</i>, pages 99-107.

<p>
In the U.S.A., the original hate-radio rabble-rouser and demagogue
Father Charles Coughlin &#8212; who invented <i>Rush-Limbaugh-style</i> hate radio
back when radio was a new medium &#8212; republished
<i>The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</i> in the USA in July of 1938,
as part of his very long tirade against the Jews.
See <i>Father Coughlin and the New Deal</i>, pp. 193-196, and
<i>Radio Priest; Charles Coughlin, The Father of Hate Radio</i>, by Donald Warren,
pages 145 to 153.<br>
And Father Coughlin was probably also receiving funds from Nazi Germany
as well as Henry Ford. See <i>Radio Priest</i>, pages 232 to 244.<br>
And Coughlin was actively disseminating Nazi propaganda:
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Some of Coughlin's writings followed speeches of Joseph Goebbels word
for word.&quot;</i></font> See: <i>Radio Priest</i>, pages 244 and 251.

Marjorie Harrison observed, 'The Group states that it &quot;never asks
for funds by either public or private appeal&quot;', but they charged
admission to the 'house parties'.<br>
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#NYT_no_funds">The <i>New York Times</i> reported</a>,
&quot;Dr. Buchman's organization tonight issued an official rejoinder
stating that it had never made a private or public appeal for funds.&quot;
(The New York Times, June 14, 1939, page 32.)<br>
Geoffrey Williamson reported the same hypocrisy in
<i>Inside Buchmanism: an independent inquiry into the Oxford Group
Movement and Moral Re-Armament</i> &#8212;
Williamson went to MRA conventions at Caux, Switzerland, and
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#appeal4funds">observed the leaders dunning the crowd for
contributions</a>.<br>
Likewise, the faithful Buchmanite and Oxford Group archivist A. J. Russell
wrote about seeing Frank Buchman writing letters to rich patrons, dunning them
for contributions, and warning them about the bad things that might happen to them
if they didn't send money:
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#shake_down">
&quot;Frank said their refusal to extend help where greatly needed
might involve them in a crop of cares they did not
foresee.&quot;</a> (<i>For Sinners Only</i>, page 200.)

See: Jack Anderson and Ronald W. May,
<i>McCarthy, The Man, The Senator, The &quot;ISM&quot;</i>
(1952), pages 174-175.<br>
On February 9, 1950, at Wheeling, West Virginia, Sen. Joe McCarthy
waved a piece of paper in the air and claimed that it was a list of
205 Communists who worked in the State Department.<br>
The next day, in Denver, Colorado, the list was &quot;205 bad security risks&quot;.<br>
The day after that, in Salt Lake City, the list had become &quot;57
card-carrying Communists&quot;.<br>
Several days later, the number was 81.<br>
McCarthy never produced any of those lists, not even when pointedly asked to do so
by the Senate subcommittees that were investigating McCarthy's charges.
Eventually, after a period of national terror that hurt a lot of people,
Joe McCarthy was censured by the U.S. Senate for bad conduct.

Howard tries to explain away his involvement with Mosley as being for

he was always strongly opposed to fascism.

In the same book, <i>Innocent Men</i>, Peter Howard told us that he
was practicing Buchmanism
&#8212; attending Oxford Group meetings (page 34),
&quot;listening to God&quot; in &quot;Guidance&quot; sessions (pages 31, 32 and 54),
&quot;making amends&quot; (pages 32-33),
and even spending a few weeks at their compound out in the country at
Hay's Mews, for the full-immersion indoctrination routine (pages 64 to 71).
And yet Peter Howard still dodged the question of
Oxford Group membership and pretended to be a neutral observer while writing his book
of praise of the Oxford Groups and Frank Buchman.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On page 41 Peter Howard even went so far as to say:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As you can see, when I sent in my &quot;Reply to Hickey&quot; I had
made up my mind on two points:<br>
<i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. That the Group were honest in their belief.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. That if their beliefs were true, nothing else
in the world mattered so much.<br>
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Nothing else in the world mattered so much&quot;?</font><br>
Yes, Howard was already a fully-sold true believer.

Howard J. Rose was grossly misquoting the Bible and distorting its
meaning, taking a quote out of context, when he cited John 16:13-14 as
a justification of Frank Buchman's doctrine of &quot;Guidance&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If you read the two chapters before that verse, you will see
that Jesus was giving a lecture to his disciples,
which included predicting part of the immediate future.
Then Jesus said in John 16:12 (which Howard J. Rose did not mention)
that He was not going to tell his disciples
the entire story just yet, or reveal the whole future to them right then, because they
would not understand it. However, Jesus said in the next few lines,
the Holy Spirit would come to the disciples later and tell them the rest
of the story and clarify everything.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It does not say a word about the
Holy Spirit coming to anybody else and revealing the future to them.
It was a gross distortion of what the book of John actually says
for Howard J. Rose to cite John 16:13-14 and claim that it
means that the Holy Spirit will come to Oxford Groupers during their
&quot;Quiet Time&quot; and reveal things <i>to them</i>, and deliver
work orders <i>to them</i>.
In those verses, Jesus said to his disciples:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
12. I have much more to say to you, but right now it would be more
than you could understand. 13. The Spirit shows what is true and will
come and guide you into the full truth.
The Spirit doesn't speak on his own. He will tell you only what he
has heard from me, and he will let you know what is going to happen.
14. The Spirit will bring glory to me by taking my message and telling it
to you.<br>

Howard J. Rose is doing it again. The citation of Jeremiah 10:2
in support of the occult practice of <i>Automatic Writing</i>
is so senseless and so irrelevant that I wonder if it was a typographical error.
What that verse actually says is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
10:2 Don't follow the custom of those nations who become frightened when
they see something strange happen in the sky.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The closest thing that I find that seems relevant is Jeremiah 36:1...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah,
the LORD said to me, &quot;Jeremiah, since the time Josiah was king, I have
been speaking to you about Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Now
get a scroll and write down everything I have told you, then read it to the
people of Judah. Maybe they will stop sinning when they hear what terrible
things I plan for them...&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It would be an extreme stretch to interpret that as instructions for
Oxford Group members to write down their &quot;Guidance from God&quot; in notebooks.

I am assuming that the intended definition of &quot;squeeze&quot; is that of coercive
extortion and demanding bribes, as in &quot;putting the squeeze on somebody&quot; by demanding bribes
and threatening dire consequences for not paying bribes or extortion fees.
<i>Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</i>
gives this definition:
&quot;<i>informal.</i> an act of threatening, intimidating, harrassing, or oppressing
a person or persons to obtain a favor, money, or an advantageous attitude or action.&quot;

Times, The (United Kingdom), May 30, 2002,
&quot;Patrick Wolrige-Gordon&quot; obituary on page 33.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Note: Wolrige-Gordon was apparently not a typographical error;
Patrick used two spellings of his name: Wolrige-Gordon, and Wolridge-Gordon.
He was elected to Parliament under the name &quot;Patrick Wolrige-Gordon&quot;, while
Patrick's father spelled the family name Wolridge-Gordon.
Also see The New York Times, Nov. 22, 1958, page 43.)<br>
</font>
Patrick Wolrige-Gordon was a British politician who got involved with
Frank Buchman's <i>Moral Re-Armament</i>, much to the detriment of his
political career. He also married Peter Howard's daughter, Anne Howard, in 1962.
MRA and Frank Buchman were held in bitter contempt by most of the British people.
The Times reported,
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;PATRICK WOLRIGE-GORDON was probably the only British MP to have lost his seat
on account of his links with the Moral Re-Armament (MRA) movement.&quot; &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The dashing young Patrick in fact became engaged to be married to the
beautiful Anne Howard, daughter of Peter Howard, one of Buchman's right-hand
men. But the gradual involvement of the MP in MRA attracted comment throughout
the country and caused some dismay in the Wolridge-Gordon family, with
Patrick's father deploring his son's involvement with Buchman's cause.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also see The New York Times obituary of Peter Howard, Feb 26, 1965, page 29, which
lists Peter Howard's three children, including the daughter Anne who was married to
&quot;Patrick Wolridge-Gordon&quot;.
