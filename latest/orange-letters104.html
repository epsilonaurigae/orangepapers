You can write what you like, Mr Orange....

<p>
But you cannot ever write anything which changes the absolute fact that
everyday AA is helping to improve the lives of lots, and lots, and
lots, of people from all over the world and from all walks of life...
And hopefully, always will.

<p>
It obviously did not work for you, and unfortunately, it is true to say
it doesn't work for everyone... I'm sure there are vast number's of
reason's for this and I will not pretend to be intelliegent enough to
know, or comprehend them all (or even a small proportion of them... )
Or, be self-righteous enough to claim that my way (the &quot;AA way&quot;) is the
only way, or even the best way... If you, or anyone else,
finds something else that work's better for you... Then a sincere best
wishes and goodluck to you.

<p>
All I do know is it is an absolute fact that AA does indeed work for
lots, and lots, and lots, of people from all over the world and from all
walks of life... And hopefully, always will.

<p>

Hello Danny,
<p>
The simple answer is that A.A. does not work to make alcoholics quit drinking. Period.
<p>
Bill Wilson was just lying to get people to join his organization when he wrote on page 58 of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;
</font>

<p>
Now if you think that A.A. works, then please answer these simple questions about how well it works:
<p>
<a name="success_rate"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">What is the real A.A. success rate</a>?<br>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many of them will pick up:
<ul>
<li> a one-year coin for sobriety?
<li> a five-year coin?
<li> a ten-year coin for sobriety?
<li> How about the 11-year coin? What percentage of the newcomers will eventually get an 11-year coin?<br>
</ul>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not very many, right?<br>

<p>
And that is all that you need to know about how much A.A. helps alcoholics.
<p>
Hint: the answers are
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
<p>
By the way, in 7 years of me asking those questions, I have not ever
had one A.A. member answer those questions honestly. Not one. Not ever.
That says something about the &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; of the A.A.
&quot;manner of living&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Paul L.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Lovely research!<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I just wanted to drop you a note about the Orange Papers.  I very much enjoy reading
the facts you present.  I earlier this year (10 months ago) attended AA meetings for
around three months.

<p>
Meeting one: I mentioned that I was leary about coming due to the religious factor,
that seemed so prominent on the web site.  I was quickly ambushed at the end of the
meeting by four &quot;older&quot; members to ensure me that religion had nothing to do with
it!

<p>
Meeting three:  was asked why I didn't attend the meeting the night before.  I
simply said, &quot; I was busy.&quot;  They responded, &quot;Busy doing what?.... getting drunk!&quot;
Followed by sarcastic snickering.

<p>
Meeting four and beyond:  Consistently made to feel guilty because I was not trying
hard enough to find my higher power.  Invited on a weekend camping trip with ten
other members (I didn't even know these people).  Started to notice the glazed over
eyes of members of more than a year.  Subtle comments made during &quot;sharing&quot; to
expose my unwillingness to surrender myself to a &quot;higher power&quot;, and believing I
could quit drinking on my own.  Started to notice the members bet. 19 and 25 getting
too involved in the group and forgetting that they are only 19 &#8212; 25 years old, they
have yet to live! They are also convinced that they need AA to stay sober.  But
that's because they have given up on themselves and are totally dependent upon the
group meetings to live.

<p>
My work began to suffer more than when I was drinking.  I actually got fired within
two months of being sober.  Prior to that I always did an excellent job, I was just
hungover.  The twelve steps and brain washing made me complacent.  I witness this in
two people I work with now! They are both AA's and have been &quot;sober &#8212; so they say&quot;
for seven years.  Both are irritating to work with because they don't let mistakes
bother them enough to even try and correct.  They live only for the day they are
working and are selfish employees.  They talk a good game, but most definitely are
the least favorite in the kitchen. (I am a chef).

<p>
I could go on... but you have hit the nail on the head.  The thing that made me
really stop, was this:  My sponsor invited me golfing to his club.  He made me pay
for everything myself, and proceeded to make fun of my golf clubs.  He was the
anti-thesis of what the program is supposed to be about.  He was 10 years sober!

<p>
Since I have stopped AA meetings, I don't even think about drinking.  I just don't.
Going to meetings everynight.  And it is true they want you to go every night in your
first year!  F-off!, I was constantly thinking about booze.  I was getting pissed
off that I couldn't have any.  But it was all the talk about booze.

<p>
I only pray now for the poor young souls lost in AA.  It would be interesting to
find the stats out on what happens to people who enter AA as a teen and continue,
and those that leave, and those that were heavy drinkers but never went to a
meeting, but managed to quit with the help of friends and family!  I have a very
good picture what has happend to those who stayed.

<p>
I do credit AA with getting me off the juice, but I credit myself for staying off
the juice.  This is the longest I have ever gone since I was 15 years old without
alcohol.  I don't pass the buck on to a mythological higher power, I pass the buck
to no one but myself!.

<p>
Thanks for a good read,

<p>
Paul L. LOL

<p>
PS.  The funniest thing is the e-mail's I get from the group.  So much for anonymity
 &#8212;  everyones e-mail address was in plain sight for everyone to see, including mine
that is my name.  I let them know this, and all I got in return was &#8212; did you ask
for your e-mail to not be seen?  I answered yes, what don't you understand about the
word anonymous!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Your observations are verified by many others. The thing about meetings making
you want to drink really stood out. I have felt the same thing, and other people have reported it too.
I'd be fine before I went to a meeting, but came out of the meeting wanting a drink.
It's easier to stay sober by not going to meetings.
<p>
And it really would be interesting to see the stats of kids who joined A.A. as teenagers, but I
don't have any source of such numbers.
<p>
And about giving A.A. credit for getting you off of booze, I would question that. You wouldn't have quit
if you hadn't wanted to quit, and A.A. didn't make you want to quit, did it?
You wanted to quit, and you decided to quit, so you both quit and went to some A.A. meetings where they
sneered at you.
<p>
Have a good day.

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
My friend and I co-host a show on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222217/http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">www.blogtalkradio.com</a>
called &quot;Shattering the Myth&quot;
and the purpose of the show is to debunk the lies and myths that human ego has
injected into &quot;the program&quot; and to expose the inconsistencies that the tenets of AA
are based on.

<p>
We discovered your website a long time ago, but would like to reference some of your
material (particularly the cult section) in an upcoming show, and wish to ask you if
you would support our use of your material as long as we are careful to mention the
website and give the proper credit.  We'd also like to invite you to listen in to
the show if you are so inclined; you could also listen at another time as the show
is recorded and posted to the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222217/http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">www.blogtalkradio.com</a>

Here's a link to the show:

<p>
In any case, thank you for your amazing website, the amount of research you put into
it, and the clarity of your arguments.  We are both intrigued by your findings and I
am regular visitor to your site.

<p>
Best regards,

Hi Dan,
<p>
Yes, of course. Use all of the material you want. The more people who are getting the information

<p>
Wow.  I just read your orange paper on
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot720.html">Up WIth People</a>&quot;
and it left me
wondering what on earth they did to you.  I know the origins of the
group were with Moral Rearmament but I also know it very quickly
transformed to be something very different by the early 70's.  I
traveled with Up WIth People in 1973 and I have absolutely no idea
what MRA even IS.  WHen I traveled, we were by definition not
politically or religiously affiliated &#8212; it was an international non-
religious group.  (No one was against the Vietnam war more than I or
most of my friends in the group.  If being in the group meant
supporting the war, we wouldn't have had a cast.)  Those
&quot;segregated&quot; (male/female) busrides were long gone, and the cast
members had no shorter hair than anyone else of the time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Marty,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Your ignorance of the real roots of UWP does not change the facts.<br>
It's good that you were against the war in the seventies. When UWP went on national TV in the sixties,
they were very pro-war, and had an act that made fun of the anti-war hippies.
And they had lots of flag-waving &quot;super-patriotic&quot; skits.
My parents cheered. Of course, my father was a lifer career sergeant in the Air Force, and very pro-war.
<p>
If you were in MRA in 1973, perhaps you knew
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#Dr_Morris_Martin_1">Dr. Morris Martin</a>, who was
with the show until 1973 as a full-time teacher. Dr. Martin was
Dr. Frank Buchman's personal secretary, and also,
surviving MRA members have said, Frank Buchman's gay lover.
And you think you weren't getting taught the Oxford Group&#8212;MRA philosophy?

I currently work in the film business and have worked with incredible
folks &#8212; Shirley MacLaine, Elizabeth Taylor, Milton Berle, Julia
Roberts, Dolly Parton, Morgan Freeman, etc. etc. etc.  And STILL, 35
years later, that year with Up WIth People was the most amazing year
of my life &#8212; and the people I met will always be my closest friends
and we'd do anything for each other.  I joined Up With People because
at 18, I &quot;wanted to give a year of my life to the people I met.&quot;
Sound corny?  Sure.  But the 60's were pretty crappy.  A lot of bad
shit was going on and in the days of protests, we wanted to do our
little part to help folks in the world get along.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So how does a song-and-dance troup that promotes the
Moral Re-Armament agenda &quot;help folks in the world get along&quot;?
There is that MRA&#8212;UWP grandiosity again. They constantly claimed to be
&quot;Remaking The World&quot; by doing one song-and-dance show after another.

<p>
Speaking of film people, did you know that someone just made a movie about UWP?
It's called &quot;Smile Until It Hurts&quot;. Look for it.
<p>
Glenn Close, who was also in the UWP cast, didn't want to appear in the movie, because she
dismissed UWP as just so much youthful foolishness.
</font>
<p>
I've always believed that prejudice and hate form out of ignorance
and intolerance for another &#8212; it's through knowing a person that
those walls break down.  We had a cast made up of people from all over
the globe, and we lived with families everywhere we went.  And people
in other countries who had never see Black people or American Indians,
etc. got to know people who were different from them.  We were able to
show that 165 people from different backgrounds, religions and
nationalities could live and work and perform together for a year,
providing an example to others in countries we visited.  Did everybody
get along all the time?  Of course not.  But we learned how to work it
out.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It's nice that UWP allowed token Negros and token Indians into the cast.
Frank Buchman always had the philosophy that everybody in the world should be the
slave of his fascist God, regardless of their race, creed, color, religion, or country of national origin.
</font>
<p>
I can honestly tell you that my cast was never pounded with &quot;moral&quot;
crap or political garbage.  Our only goal was to get to know the
people of the countries we visited and be a positive example of what
the world could be if everybody just gives each other a chance.  Not
only did we get immersed in the cultures of the places we visited, we
got to know and live with people there and get to know what they
thought, see things from their perspective, and get an education
unequaled to all my years in college put together.  In addition to
performing our show, we worked in the communities and got to
experience things most people don't experience in a lifetime &#8212; 
Astronaut Eugene Cernan showed us around NASA, I watched Dr. Debakey
perform an open heart surgery, I learned sign language from kids at a
deaf school.  It saddens me to see folks make fun of something that
was the most positive experience of my life.  Moral Armament sounds
funky as hell &#8212; no way would I have joined UWP if that was still the
driving force in '73.  I hate to think that folks still hold MRA
against UWP since it hasn't had anything to do with MRA for 40 years.
And the Orange Papers make it seem like that's still what UWP is all
about.

<p>
Just my dos pesos.

<p>
Marty E.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Marty. You have had your say. The fact remains that UWP was a just
another front for MRA, and just another part of its publicity machine.
UWP was created by and controlled by MRA.  And UWP was financed by major
corporations that profitted from the Vietnam War.
<p>
The fact that you really enjoyed traveling around with the UWP show doesn't change
the fact that the goal of the organization was to promote Frank Buchman's philosophy.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Enjoy your site overall<br>

<p>
I like your website and what it does to tell the truth about AA.  You
do a better job than most sites I have seen.

<p>
One aspect that I would like to comment on is the incessant references
to the W administration.  I am not a fan of the Bush administration
and what they have done to increase/abuse executive power in this
country but it really feels like the reader of your site is getting
beat over the head with your politics.  This is especially true in the
propaganda/debating techniques section.  I know you spent a lot of
time on your work, and it shows but some of the political correlations
seem lazy.

<p>
I think it distracts from the main idea of the site, which is to
expose AA and all of their nonsense.  Why drag politics into this and
attenuate your well thought out points?  Plus, I think we need to get
as many people into the anti-AA fold, conservatives or not.

Hello Matt,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments, and the problem is solved. G. W. Bush is gone,
and all of the political cartoonists are hurting for material now.
<p>
The reason that I have mentioned political things in the past is because I cannot compartmentalize the world
and restrict my interests to just one area and say, &quot;I will care about this issue, but I won't care about that.&quot;
I care about both 100,000 Americans dying of alcoholism, and 100,000
innocent Iraqis dying in a needless war.
As far as I'm concerned, there are no &quot;outside issues&quot;.
It's all the real world, and we are in it.

<p>
But I won't flog a dead horse, so I don't think there will be many more mentions of what's-his-name.

Have a good day.

<p>
Hi

<p>
The rather long subject header just refers to a TV I just watched in England
about 'who was the greatest TV detective?', starting with Sherlock Holmes
and onwards. Anyway one of the most significant serious crime detective
series was called 'Prime Suspect' which starred Helen Mirren and was very
hard-hitting. I didn't remember this at the time but a sub-plot was that she
was progressively suffering from a drink problem, which the show's narrator
proudly announced 'maybe she'll go to AA' or words to that effect.
Hmmm. Sorry to be the bearer of such depressing info but it appears the
stranglehold of the 12 steps and AA in particular are not just confined to
TV writers on your side of the pond.

I would love to know your story. Anyone with that much hatred fostered by self
righteous &quot;knowitallism &quot;must be in enormous inner pain and narcissistic as well.
Perhaps you should address what might be wrong with YOU instead of me. I'm a useful
and productive happy member of my community and family today as a direct result of
the AA program and its SUGGESTIONS. I am not a cult member but call it what you
like.Today I can be of service to those around me and love you as well. May I have
that right.

Not really wanting to dig deeply into your babbling am I correct in assuming you are

Hey Orange,

<p>
Stumbled across your website while trying to do a google search.

<p>
Wow &#8212; you really have a huge issue with AA.  I am curious why that is so.  You
probably have posted your reasons on your site, but I have not read everything on
there.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ksmrk,
<p>
The simple answer to your curious question is, &quot;Because A.A. does not work, and harms more alcoholics than it helps.&quot;
<p>
Read the file on

I am sure you get a ton of hate emails from AA members who jealously guard their
association with AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>
Just wanted to let you know that I am sober for 9 months now (and reasonably sane)
and AA has worked for me where nothing else has.  I have come across many people who
are able to take what they need and leave the rest.  I agree with most of what AA
offers and professes &#8212; some precepts more strongly than others.  BUT... I am sober
and it is because of AA.

<p>

My wish for any alcoholic is that they are able to find what works for them... AA or

<p>
<font color="blue">
I wish the best for alcoholics too. That's why I tell the truth about the various &quot;treatments&quot; or &quot;solutions&quot;

This addiction sucks, and I would not begrudge anyone relief from alcoholism just

Subject:  	It works !<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
The reality is that AA has worked for many people where nothing else has.
Something like that can't be 'bagged' altogether.

<p>
AA does offer a fairly common-sense spiritual solution which people can
adapt for themselves.  It is not prescriptive.  &quot;God&quot; is something for the
individual to understand/define for himself.

<p>
AA also offers a community, something which is fairly essential for most
people to function happily in any society.

<p>
AA doesn't cost much to operate and is self-supporting, an admirable thing.

<p>
AA also works by attaction. It doesn't proselytise or inflict itself on
those who don't want it. Some individuals might in their misguided
understanding of the AA principles but the organisation itself doesn't
espouse this kind of conduct. AA works on the basis of consent and free
will to participate in the Fellowship. People participate because they
choose to and the sobriety and support they therefore gain is of huge
individual and social benefit.

<p>
<a name="Bills_tobacco"> </a>
<a name="tobacco"> </a>
With regard to some of your comments about smoking, well smoking wasn't
really recognised as a major health problem until the last 1970's and
1980's.    Smoking doesn't have such an immediately deleterious effect as
too much alcohol, so this is understandable.  AA focused on alcoholism
because that was the MAIN problem and one that had to be tackled before
anything else.

<p>
Many people these days who get free of alcohol go on to deal with other
addictions such as nicotine or other drugs, or other compulsive behaviours
such as gambling.

<p>
We understand addiction/compulsion differently in this day and age but that
doesn't stop the AA program from working.  In fact I believe that Bill
Wilson and his colleagues at the time AA commenced showed a highly intuitive
but accurate understanding of addiction &#8212; physical, mental and spiritual.

<p>
So, it works and harms none.  People can make their own choices about
attending, using the 12 Steps.

<p>
Best wishes ~

<p>
Kate

A.A. is most assuredly <i>not</i> a program of &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot;.

<p>
<li>
Your minimization and denial of the issue of tobacco is revealing. The harmful effects of tobacco were
actually well known a long time ago. Mark Twain complained about how his doctor gave him a hard time about smoking
too much, and demanded that he cut down. It isn't like it's a recent medical discovery and neither Bill Wilson nor God
could have known how bad tobacco is.
<p>
And tobacco kills about four times as many Americans as alcohol, every year, so it is hardly a minor &quot;outside issue&quot;.

Dear orange,

I could not beleive this wonderfull site. This gave me a lot of
insights and darker sides of AA and NA . I would like to introduce my self
as a drug user from chennai in india. I have an organization called IVDU
<i>inner voice of drug users</i>, we fight for the rights of drug users and abuse
the drug users going through american policy propaganda.
<p>
Of lately i heard
that local NA members were planning to lobby a ruling party's politician.
This is a good eye opener for us, we can argue on why the govt should 
help such organizations. There are a number of rehablitation centres or
simply drug rehabs run by these AA and NA members.
<p>
i can get some stuff on
the abuses from here would you be interested to have it on your web site or
if there is some thing like orange papers for NA please guide me so that
these dirty people who call themselves clean can be exposed.

Dear orange,
<p>
          Thanks a lot, i am one of the guy directly affected by the 12
steps group called NA. Over here these guys wreck havoc amongst the drug
users and alcoholics in the treatment industry. Out here there are no
regulations. any one can register and open a treatment centre. this is where
all the atrocities happen there are people who lost lives because of the
inhumane and negligence, these so called therapeutic communities are the AA
and NA.
<p>
 There is also a court case proceeding going on on a NA member, who
owns a rehab called sumana good will home, One guy died of burns, no one
knows what happened, actually on the day the patient was burnt, he had his
family there to see him in the rehab, but the rehab staff did not allow the
family to see    the patient. the family didn't know that their loved one is
suffering with pain of burn injuries. They sent the family away telling that
the patient is unconscious.
<p>
 But the truth came out when the patient died.
Autopsy report says that the burns occurred much before the rehab staff
claimed.
 So the family registered a complaint and a case was lodged. We are
following it.
<p>
 These guys believe in tough love and in the name of tough
love, there are multiple horror stories. i myself have been in a rehab like
that run by a church priest named Father Rev. Desmond daniels.  i have been
through hell. I have to stop this orange. I will do it with
our Registered Non-profit.

Dear Orange,

<p>
Love your web site.  I too became involved in AA 30 years ago back when I
was a crazed young drug taking, booze drinking kid.  What I found was
sanctimonious, cult like figures who demand total devotion, which to me
seemed suspect.  I always rejected any kind of religion and because I was
basically told I was powerless and stupid my whole life I didn't need that
reinforced.   So the whole god/higher power concept really escaped me and
still does.  I understand having to separate yourself from some bad
influences. I did take some good concepts away like admit when your wrong
and make amends to those you hurt.  I've learned that I'm not an alcoholic,
I was going through a period of letting myself be influenced by some not so
nice people.  I like the buzz I get from wine &#8212; that's why I drink it!  I
don't want to live in a bubble and that's what AA was, a lock step must do
or fail bubble of self righteousness &#8212; one must learn to live in the REAL
world.

You have put many of my thoughts into words.  Thank you.  Several days ago I
dropped out of AA after ~6 months.  This was my second experience with AA
and I had forgotten how ineffective it is.  Actually, it is much much worse
than ineffective &#8212; it is dangerous.  I was attending a daily morning meeting

don't blame them &#8212; they are scared to hell.)  That 6 months was a nightmare.
I may try to record a video about the experience &#8212; for my mental health.  May

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
You page is full of naive generalizations and biased, skeptical,
hateful opinion with no basis in fact; your website potentially
damages suffering alcoholics who could recover in AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Dirk,
<p>
There it is again, the standard A.A. line about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are doing a great disservice to those who are seeking sobriety.&quot;
</font><br>
<a href="orange-letters103.html#disservice">Look here for more of that</a>.
<p>
A.A. does not work. I am not just generalizing. Even one of your leaders, a member of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., discovered through his own testing that A.A. was a failure that
just raised the death rate in alcoholics.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.&quot;
</font><br>
== Dr. George E. Vaillant, currently a member of the A.A. Board of
Trustees, describing the treatment of alcoholism with Alcoholics
Anonymous, in <i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns,
and Paths to Recovery</i>, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA,
1983, pages 283-286.
</blockquote>

<p>
While trying to prove that A.A. worked great, he accidentally proved that A.A. was a failure that harmed
more alcoholics than it helped.
There is much more on that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">here</a>.

</font>
<p>
My guess is you are a frustrated alcoholic who could not do the work
in AA necessary to stay sober, or that you have a friend or relative
for whom AA has failed. &quot;Rarely have we seen a person fail who has
thoroughly followed our path&quot; &#8212; you obviously do not understand what
&quot;thoroughly&quot; means. It's a lot more that just showing up at meetings.
Before you spew your harmful rants, you should go to a few dozens
meetings and talk to sober people there to find out the truth about
this amazing program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong guess. I have 8 years clean and sober, and I am quite happy about it.
<p>
I understand what &quot;thoroughly&quot; means. It's a word game:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail to quit drinking in Alcoholics Anonymous, who has thoroughly quit drinking
by using his own intelligence and will power, and then gave the credit to A.A.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
</font>
<p>
Also, there is a huge difference, as you would know if you spent time
with alcoholics, between those who are dry and those who have true
recovery/sobriety. Those who have true recovery in AA are happy and
productive and they find fulfillment through working with other
alcoholics who still suffer from this fatal disease.

<p>

Sober 28 years in AA

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your 28 years.
<p>
I have spent enough time in A.A. and N.A. to learn what they are,
and I've spent a lot more time with alcoholics than you know.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
I have been reading information from the Orange Pages about AA and I am not sure who
wrote this and nothing is really said about the author so I can determine
reliability.  Could you please give me some information on the author and how
&quot;he/she&quot; came to believe AA was a type of cult?

<p>
Thank you and I appreciate anything you could give me.  I am looking for reasons why
or why not to attend AA.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>

Hello Debbie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer. I'm very backlogged on answering the email.
<p>
The best way to check credibility is to pick out some of the quotes that you find to be the
most interesting, and verify them, and see whether
I am quoting honestly and accurately. You will find that almost everything I say is backed up by
a lot of quotes from various doctors, theologians, or other authorities, so verify some quotes.

Dear Mr Orange
<p>
a very interesting study. I wonder what made you go into this, in such depth?<br>
I had been reading it as part of my college work (research on therapies)<br>
<p>
...eric<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi Eric,

<p>
Thanks for the letter. Why such depth? Well, first off, that is just my nature. I've always been
that way. When I was a kid I wanted to know absolutely everything in the world that there was to know.
As you can guess, before I grew up, I discovered that that was physically impossible.
There is just too much stuff to know.
(The age of the Rennaisance Man is long gone.)
<p>
Nevertheless, I'm not satisfied with superficial knowledge. I want to know all of the gory details
and learn as much as I can.

<p>

Hey Orange,

<p>
Happy thanksgiving!

<p>
Do you have any interest in, or do you think there would be any value in an orange papers group on here?

<p>
One of my newer patients told her sponsor something rather mild about
my views on treatment, something along the lines of &quot;he's not a
huge fan of AA but has been sober for 23 years&quot; and her sponsor
remarked that I must be a dry drunk or else had a &quot;bad experience&quot;....

<p>
I reassured her that, no there was no bad experience, I just gradually
un-brainwashed myself via education and personal/professional work
experience and that I am quite happy these days.

<p>
She was surprised to learn that 'dry drunk' was not an actual legitimate
mental condition! Most people I see are relieved to find out that it is
merely a made up condition to describe what basically amounts to a
negative attitude, and let's see, last time I checked former problem
drinkers didn't have the market cornered on bad attitudes! But, like
many AA beliefs, much of the individual's character is pathologized and
ego-centrically steered back to &quot;alcoholism&quot; rather than common
characteristics that many people have to one degree or another.

<p>
Many of my AA patients are surprised that there is no alcohol-ISM anywhere
in the DSM-IV... only alcohol abuse/dependence, nor any mention of disease.

<p>
Anyway, hope you have a great day!

<p>

Hi Allan,

<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to get to it. Obviously, I
don't poke around in my Facebook mailbox very often.  And that's the first
reason why I kind of shy away from the idea of setting up a group on Facebook.
It would be a funny kind of group if I rarely visited my own group.

<p>

Thanks for the story on the dry drunk. I am also occasionally surprised
by people who believe that a &quot;dry drunk&quot; condition is a real
psychiatric problem, or real threat to their mental health.  It's really
amazing how pervasive the mythology of the 12-Step organization is.

<p>
Oh well, have a happy New Year.

<p>
I've got 10 years off alcohol.

<p>
8 off tobacco

<p>
6 off caffeine

<p>
About 5 years of good diet and exercise.

<p>
I did AA for about 4 years. Church ministry for 7. I do a lot of spiritual
work. I've always thought that's what's keeping me sober. I was really ready
to quit, though. Other friends also quit with various spiritual methods. A
few have died.

<p>
I still smoke pot off and on.

<p>
The spiritual work has given me a life's purpose.

<p>
I can see some validity to your argument. I was ready. Just turned 50 a
couple days ago.
