So many people have different opinions about the subject or addiction, but it seems
to me that change is in the air?! That many people are demanding something better
than AA. When the truth starts to become: people w/out treatment do better (I
believe it) because between the times I would binge &amp; the times I wanted to be sober
(I was better w/out AA) doing it alone. I believe one reason I got so sick at AA is
because it took me so far down the wrong path in relationship to (my truth &amp; the
truth) &amp; left me lost on the trail.
After the love-bombing (one-two years) AA did
turn abusive on me &amp; abandon me (during the last year).

<p>
I have found my way back to
the path of reality.
I don't worship either of you like people do AA, but I know
both of you saved my life from AA. All the things AA was saying &amp; doing to me
(verbal crazy making like Patrica Evans talks about) and then denying doing  were
items that both of you have exposed the truth to the light. The truth is where
sanity lives.

<p>
PS: I do not know if I sent this to Mike? but this is what a Dr. put my sister on
after she finally quit her psych meds (I have nothing against meds if they work &amp;
they are the right ones, but I do have something against meds if they are screwing a
person up worse!) My sister has been on them a month &amp; she notices a huge
improvement. I have been trying them for a week &amp; feel better. You don't take them
forever maybe 3-6 months. Just wanted to share.

Hi Anne,
<p>
It's good to hear from you. Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.
I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better. It brightens
up the morning cup of coffee to hear that I was able to help in some small way.
<p>
I totally agree about the meds &#8212; if they are helping the patient, then that is good.
If they are hurting the patient, then discontinue the medications and find something
better. And that is just what competent doctors do.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

Hi Orange,

<p>
I've been trawling through your site again with the intention of doing some
amateur proof-reading.

<p>
Here's a couple of typos/spelling mistakes I have noticed.

<p>
In your essay 'Heresy of the 12 Steps', you have Bangladesh spelt
Bengladesh, likewise Chechniya should be spelt Chechnya.

<p>
In 'The Bait and Switch Con Game', in your description of Bait and Switch
no. 32, you have a  quote from 'Pass it on'. 'Pysical' should be spelt
'physical'.

<p>
I hope all is well.

Subject:  	Hello and Thanks<br>
Sender:  	Simon<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I've been reading your excellent work for a few weeks. In truth, I was
first here about 18 months ago. At that time I was fully embroilled in
AA, racking up a few months sober, getting drunk again, in and out of
treatment, hating 12-step meetings but dragging myself along 2 or 3 times
a week. I was desperate to stay sober and, though I just couldn't see
how the 12-steps had anything to do with staying sober, I believed what
I was being told by health professionals, counsellors, family, friends
and of course other steppers; that AA was the only way and that it would
work if I worked it, and that if I didn't work it I would die. I sat in
endless meetings staring at those faded 12 step scrolls desperately
trying to understand what the steps had to do with staying sober. I
think also that I wanted to find somewhere where I &quot;belonged&quot;. I'd never
really felt that I belonged anywhere before. When I found I didn't
belong in the rooms either I became seriously depressed.

<p>
When I first visited your site back then I still believed that AA had to
be right and that I was the problem (after all that's what I was being
told by &quot;professionals&quot;), I admit I was angry with you. I wanted your
research to be flawed (of course it's not), or I wanted to conclude that
you were nasty, mad, resentful, not really an addict/alcoholic, dry
drunk, etc. etc. After all you are regularly accused of all these things
by 12-steppers, many of whom seem not to have given your site more than
a cursory glance (not even your autobiographical notes). I see now of
course that you're a decent, intelligent, compassionate guy (and an
animal lover too) who dares to tell the truth about the 12 step cartel
which is failing addicts and society so shamefully (shamelessly?).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Simon,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>
I went to my last AA meeting about 9 months ago. I never really decided
to stop going. I just found myself doing some other good stuff in my
life which was clearly going to help me stay sober and couldn't find the
time for tedious, depressing meetings. In fact until a few weeks ago I
still found myself thinking, with some guilt &quot;Perhaps I should get to a
meeting sometime.&quot; Now I know I will never go to a meeting again. In
fact to do so would undoubtedly jeopardise my sobriety. Coming to your
site has helped me reach that decision, so thanks for that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are welcome. Personally, I think that going to another meeting
would be just an unnecessary pain.  I have a hard time silently sitting
through all of the opening lies, like &quot;RARELY have we seen
a person fail....&quot;

</font>
<p>
One experience you related did particularly strike a chord, so I thought
I'd mention it. I can't find the comment in your letters section now,
but you'll be able to date it because you wrote it on your 5th sober
anniversary. You were wondering whether to go to your first NA meeting
in ages to collect a 5 year chip (did you go?). You just couldn't bear
the thought of people taking the credit, on behalf of NA, for your clean
time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I never went and got that coin or keytag. Or any others, ever again.
I finally managed to let go of my attachment to drunk junk.
Then, at the 7-year point, a friend who is an ex-member sent me his 7-year coin, just for
the hell of it. I suppose that might be the last one, ever.

</font>
<p>
Now I sat in meetings for more years than I care to remember, looking
miserable, bored and anxious (because that's how meetings made me feel).
Then, as I mentioned, I found other things in life that lifted my
negativity and helped me to stay sober. In one of the last meetings I
attended some guy noticed my happier disposition and commented on it.
&quot;You look happier these days.&quot; I said &quot;Yes, I am, thanks.&quot; You can guess
his response. &quot;You see. This program works.&quot; I was angry at the time.
Not any more, It helped me realise just how totally irrelevant the
program is to my sobriety.

<p>
Incidentally, I don't think chips, coins, keyrings are handed out so
much here in the UK. One has to go to certain specific meetings to
collect them. The only one I have is a Cocaine Anonymous newcomer's
keyring. Now I've put a whole lot of nasty chemicals into my body over
the years but amazingly have never taken cocaine, despite its apparent
ubiquity here in London (detectable in the river Thames). I was in a
treatment centre and attendance at all 12 step meetings was mandatory.
Even people there for eating disorders, traumatic disorders or just
depression were pretty much forced to attend. So I was pushed up at the
end of the meeting to collect my keyring and a round of applause. How
crazy. In the view of the 12 step evangelists in the treatment industry
there is no problem that cannot be solved by the program. That's very
sinister, not to mention the vast amounts of money, both public and
private being poured into ineffective recovery programs. Still, better
for me not to get on to the subject of the treatment industry scandal.
I'll be here typing all day. Another time maybe.

Snake oil would supposedly cure anything.
Of course, it was highly questionable just how many snakes were actually in that
&quot;snake oil&quot;...)

Hi

<p>
I just read this excerpt of your  writing on amazon:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005043/http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/R1BOV3EQEHHA3B" target="newwin31">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/R1BOV3EQEHHA3B</a><br>
and
I must say it expressed exactly what I felt 8 years ago at an AA meeting
and yesterday at an SLAA (sex and love addicts).  The room was full of
women who, in my opinion, are in desperate need of thorough
psychological or psychiatric help, myself included.  And all they did
was &quot;share&quot; for five minutes, repeat the indoctrination steps, and give
up to a higher power.
<p>
First I thought it was only sad, but today I
think it's actually dangerous. I wrote an e-mail to the chairwoman but
she probably will not understand what my objections were.
<p>
Anyway, I
enrolled in a program of a scientifically based psychological institute,
which helped me cure my OCD. No groups, no higher power, just working
hard at leaving destructive patterns.

<p>
I am gonna read your website to avoid making the mistake going to AA,
NA, SLAA or whatever anymore. I am glad both at AA and SLAA one meeting
was enough for me to see what they are all about.  I am 8 years clean
and sober now, with the help of plain old cognitive therapy.

<p>
Keep up the good work.

Just stumbled upon your site looking to prove to a friend that
Bill Wilson wrote most of the Big Book, not the so called 100 drunks.
I'm talking about the first 150 pages. I think you proved me correct.

<p>
Yes. Henry Parkhurst wrote the &quot;To Employers&quot;

<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Joe_Worth" target="newwin32">Joe Worth</a>
may have helped to co-write &quot;Bill's Story&quot;,

</font>
<p>
Holy crap! What a web book. I'm sober 20 years and credit the fact that
I made friends that don't drink to long term sobriety. It's too bad there
is so much BS along the way in AA. I have not gone to many meetings in
the last 15 years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, friends who don't drink are a big help. First off, you don't have to explain
to them why you aren't drinking. They already know. Then they don't expect you
to drink, and they don't think you are strange if you don't drink with them.
It just makes things a lot easier.

I recently started going to OA meetings because my eating is messed up.
(Sugar was my first addiction, if that's possible.) OA is even more
messed up because most of the people are FAT. I never saw a drunk at an
AA meeting, but lots of fatties at OA. I think I can lose weight out of
spite by going to those meetings, and I might just make some formerly
fat friends. Unfortunately very few thin OA's don't believe that they
got thin by putting down the fork. They are more into the cult than AA's.
