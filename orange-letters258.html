Hi Orange

<p>
A friend just sent me an e-mail of the sand sculptures at Cannon Beach.  A quick
look on Google maps ahowed me it's just up the road from you.  Have you seen it?
Some amazing sculptures.

<p>
One caught my eye (attached).  Have you been moonlighting as a sand sculpture
model?...lol

<p>

No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we're looking
for the source of our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we should test
them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power.

Hello Ben,
<p>
Thanks for the note. Alas, I haven't been to Cannon Beach in over 30 years now. I used to live down that
way, in Coos Bay, but that was a long, long time ago.
<p>
Now, Cannon Beach is actually quite far away when you are riding a bicycle. But Portland has an annual
event, &quot;Sand in the City&quot;, that is also very impressive.
They fill up Pioneer Courthouse Square with sand and do the same thing.
Teams of sand sculptors work all day to produce such things.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Hi Orange.
<p>
I wrote to you a few months back, and have since read most of the
letters. Before I got to your site, I was entrenched in AA, in the belief it's AA
or drink-and-die. What blew me out of the water, was what you had to say about Bill
Wilson being a 13th stepper, a sexual predator in AA.
<p>
That alone, is what has caused me so  much pain, and confusion. A lot of the pain is
a sense of betrayal. And, I got a lot of pain when trying to talk to AA friends
about it. Either 'I don't believe it' or 'well, Bill was human. YOU are...resentful,
judgemental, angry, bitter.' take your pick.
<p>
These responses really upset me. It's like my incestuous family all over again.
And, these are responses from WOMEN.

<p>
One guy just dismissed you completely as 'some anti AA nut'. When I was telling this
guy about Bill, his sexual behaviour, and how it discredits the steps, he said 'god
wrote the steps.' Excuse me?
<p>
I have a few people i really like, one is in aa, and I haven't told them about any
of this, because i couldn't bear any more of the same denials, minimisations, and
accusations.
<p>
I've read your letters, and am horrified by how many AA true believers say of Bill
'well, he was human. so what?'

<p>
I've been to meetings since finding out, but I feel such sickness in my gut, when
people go on about the steps, and the Big Book, and 'the program.'
<p>
I've tried a few Smart meetings. I just don't want yet another way of analysing
things, and yet another person telling me how to live my life.
<p>
Since I was 23, and first went for counseling and AA, I've been told how to live.
I miss the fellowship, but it was a kind of false sense of connection. By that, I
mean that people in AA left me alone. I would get asked to share a lot, because
there's less women than men. I'd feel some sense of connection by listening and
sharing, and yet no one would come up to me afterwards, and I'd go home alone. I
don't know why it was so hard to mix and mingle.

<p>
In 1987, I had a mental breakdown after a very abusive drug and alcohol rehab. (not
12 step based.) This, after the sexual abuse by a drug and alcohol counselor. Plus
abuse and trauma growing up. So, in 1987 I went back to AA, and was extremely
traumatised. I got the message about medication being wrong. At 2 years sober, I was
very skinny (too disturbed to eat), and quite psychotic. I was hospitalised, and put
on medication for the first time. I was reluctant at first, but it brought my
anxiety levels down from 'through the roof'.

<p>
I've been on medication ever since, anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Is this
why i get left alone? some people say AA is 'loving and supportive' but I don't have
that experience at all. since i came back from a bust 5 years ago, I've been left
alone. except for one woman, that is, in 5 years, who offered support. It's like
there's a big moat around me.

<p>
Going back to the 80's and 90's, I was hospitalised a lot. One time, a memory landed
me in the acute ward of a public psychiatric hospital. I went to the AA meeting on
the grounds. They asked me to share, so I said where i was and that I was having a
really hard time. well, no one came up to me after the meeting. That really hurt at
the time.

<p>
I was left alone a lot, since '87, and got away from AA altogether. I heard a rumour
that i was drinking. I stayed sober on my own for four years. Went back to meetings,
and eventually drank again. It's no big deal, but in AA it's a huge deal. I feel
that for the rest of my life, I'll be 'one of those that kept relapsing'. One of
THOSE.

<p>
Just a few things. You get lots of letters where true believers say that they don't
think AA is the only way to stay sober. I don't believe them. I think there's a lot
of 'It's AA or drink-and-die or go crazy.'
<p>
Another thing they say is that the 12 steps are only suggestions. No, they're not.
There is huge pressure to 'do the steps.' Huge! That's why I never talked about them
from the floor.

<p>
I'm thoroughly disgusted about 13th stepping. I was 13th stepped by my drug and
alcohol counselor, who was sober in AA. He was in his 60's and i was 26. It did a
great deal of harm. The day he left my flat after doing the deed, I sat on my bed in
a state of shock for several hours. Shortly after that, I went on an all-out binge,
planning never to try and recover again. I lasted 6 weeks, and nearly attempted
suicide.  That's when I ended up in detox, and at the crazy drug and alcohol rehab.

<p>
If anything, I want to stay sober so that no one can control and abuse me anymore.
Bill Wilson's got nothing to say to me about how to  live!!! I had an uncomfortable
talk with my sponsor. She used to be mostly pretty good. Didn't go on about the
steps. But, with this Bill Wilson thing, we've parted ways.

<p>
Take care. W.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Wendy,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and a moving story. I'm sorry about all of the suffering that you 
have been going through. The health-care system has failed you badly. But I'm glad to hear
that you are doing better now.

<p>
The way that the Steppers reject you when you mention parts of the A.A. history that they don't
want to hear about is really typical of cults.
<ul>
<li> First they deny it and insist that it's wrong, and you are misinformed.
<li> Then they minimize and deny and say that it's no big deal.
<li> Then they attack you and call you evil and subversive and up to no good, and
say that you are crazy to even think such a thing.
<li> Then they cease communication and run away.
</ul>

<p>
And that is common to most all cults, too, not just A.A. You can get the same routine from the
Scientologists or the Moonies if you tell them the ugly truths about their cult and their founder.
When you criticize Scientology, the Scientologists will start loudly screaming
<i><b>&quot;What are your crimes?!&quot;</b></i> at you, as if you must be guilty
of horrible crimes to want to say something bad about Scientology.

<p>
This is nothing new.  Dr. Jeffrey Schaler described it so well quite a while ago:
<p>
<a name="Schaler_cult_busting"> </a>
<!-- a href="http://www.cris.com/~kenr1/commonsense/12steps/cult_busting.shtml" -->
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b><i>Cult Busting</i></b>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One way of testing the cult nature of a group is by challenging
the ideology binding the group together. We can discover something
about the nature of a group by how well its members tolerate
opposition to the ideology that holds the group together. How
well do members tolerate difference of opinion, opinion that
challenges the very ideological heart of the group?
<p>
Members of the cult are like a colony of insects when disturbed.
A frenzy of activity and protective measures are executed when
core ideologies are challenged. The stronger the evidence challenging
the truthfulness of the group ideology, the more likely members
of the cult are to either lash out in a more or less predictable
fashion, fall apart, or disband into separate cult colonies.

Oh well, have a good day now.

Hello Richard,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Congratulations on your sobriety. I'm glad to hear that you are abstaining
from drinking alcohol.
You did it, and you are continuing to do it. Nobody and nothing is doing it for you.
Congratulations. Well done.

<p>
I have an open mind, but not so open that my brains fall out.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Doing the practices of an old pro-Nazi cult religion</a>
from the nineteen-thirties does not make people quit drinking.
<p>
When you say that you don't know how it works, that means that it doesn't really work.
When it is impossible to explain how Action A could cause Event B, the most likely answer is that there
is no connection between the two things.
Like the rooster crowing does not really make the sun rise.
And attending meetings of an old cult religion and confessing your sins doesn't really make alcoholics
quit drinking.
<p>
What really makes alcoholics quit drinking is that they just get sick and tired of being so sick and
tired, and they decide to stop doing it, and then they do quit.
A.A. has nothing to do with it. A.A. just steals the credit for the people who were going to quit anyway.

<p>
Worst, A.A. is downright harmful, increasing binge drinking, and increasing the death rate.
We just discussed that in a previous letter, so I'll just point you to it

I heard this many years ago  and it recently came to mind.  I may not have it
correct and you may refine it.  &quot;I stopped drinking and went to AA meetings.  Soon I
started drinking again.  I stopped drinking again and went to AA meetings again and
I started drinking again.  This happened repeatedly.  Finally at an AA  meeting I
was told if you keep doing what you have been doing you will continue to drink....
so I stopped going to AA meetings.&quot;

Yes, I quite agree. It's kind of amazing how A.A. can yammer about &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, and how
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing again and again, and expecting different results,&quot;

Well,
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">the phobia induction</a>

So they quickly suppress the thought and return to their comforting fairy tale

A Radical New Definition of Addiction Creates a Big Storm | Drugs

<p>
A sweeping new definition of addiction stakes out controversial
positions that many, including the powerful psychiatric lobby, are
likely to argue with.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the tip. I just had to post a comment.
<p>

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">

ASAM &#8212;  the American Society for Addiction Medicine, was founded by Dr. Ruth Fox in order to promote the Alcoholics Anonymous quack cure for alcoholism. Dr. Fox liked to torture alcoholics by giving them antabuse and then making them drink alcohol. She insisted that all detoxing alcoholics had to get this treatment, even after she nearly killed a couple of them. Dr. Ruth Fox also liked to give alcoholics LSD because it made them more compliant.

<p>

The most recent president of ASAM was Dr. G. Douglas Talbott, who ran the Talbott-Marsh Treatment Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Talbott was sued out of the business for false imprisonment and false diagnosis of a doctor who was not an alcoholic.
<p>

In May, 1999, just after Talbott stepped down as president of ASAM, a jury
awarded Dr. Leonard Masters, of Jacksonville Florida, a judgment of $1.3
million against Talbott, his daughter-in-law Morrison, and other Talbott
associates for malpractice, fraud, and false imprisonment, based on Masters'
stay with Talbott in 1994. Testifying at Masters' trial that he was not in
fact alcohol dependent, as he had been diagnosed by Talbott et al., was Anne
Geller, the president of ASAM prior to Talbott. Talbott's attorneys quickly
settled with the plaintiff before the jury decided on punitive damages
against Talbott and his colleagues (an amount which is usually a multiple of
the compensatory damages that had already been awarded).
<p>



Despite this legal setback, Talbott has faced no professional repercussions.
Indeed, the ASAM has neglected to discuss the case at all in the year since
the Masters' decision in its newsletter or at its Web site. And ASAM and
Talbott continue to bask in their roles as the premier medical advocates for
and caretakers of addicted individuals.
<p>



What you will not get from the news reports is that the judge was so
impressed with Talbott's ability to intimidate those who testified against
him that:
<ol>
<li> No witnesses were sworn in by name!
Witnesses were introduced as &quot;the doctor from Pennsylvania&quot;
or the &quot;veterinarian from North Carolina&quot;!
Thats all... no name. Sometimes the
doctor's wives got to testify to confirm the threats made to the families.
</li><li> After the trial the trial transcripts were &quot;sealed&quot;. Perhaps to protect
the witnesses, but this move, unfortunately, also protects the public from
ever knowing the abuses that the witnesses spelled out to the jury.
</li></ol>
<p>

Talbott also has a bad track record for driving his patients &#8212;  other doctors and nurses &#8212; to suicide.
<p>

That is the kind of organization that we are talking about here.
<p>
Oh, and ASAM still has not condemned Dr. Talbott or his practices.
<p>

Now ASAM thinks they are going to define addiction?

Christopher: &quot;I just looked it up. Good work! The question is &#8212;
will the APA be bullied into reflecting this in the DSM? One would hope
not. Science &#8212;  not emotion!&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
I really hope not too. It looks like such a naked grab for more money.
If the definition of addiction expands, and the patients have a disease
over which they have no control, then obviously those poor slobs need
more expensive treatment that will get paid for by the government or
HMO or somebody...

there's your suicide rate right there. Keep at it. Unfortunately for this cause &#8212;

<p>
Thoughtful stuff to be sure, I am aware the program was pirated from the
oxford group.   I am also aware that alcohol is only mentioned in the first
step.   Basically, AA postulates that spirituality is the fix for the
emotional problems that caused alcoholics to obsess about drinking, so they
took someone else's spiritual boot camp.    I personally don't believe in a
traditional Christian God, and neither do most of the people I know.

<p>
However I do think the 7 deadly sins are indeed the cause of some trouble.
They are separate from other sins because they are simply forms of
selfishness &#8212; they are not deadly at all despite their name.    The &quot;deadly&quot;
part is a misnomer.  They are also not unique to Christianity;  Buddhists
and Muslims also share the idea that these pursuits are harmlful.  I have to
check about Hindus.

<p>
I definitely think its desirable to be hard working, unselfish, humble,
etc.   Those are the qualities I admired in my grandparents.   they used to
call t character.

I didn't however, notice some of those contradictions you pointed out in the
literature.    There is definitely some questionable language used in the
literature, that's a fact.   I didn't notice how rigid some of those
concepts were stated to be since the book repeatedly says they are not
rigid.   Odd contradiction.   I can say with certainty that I don't find the
practice to be rigid at all, many people just do whatever they want.

Hello again, Brandon,
<p>
About the Seven Deadly Sins: Yes, The Oxford Group assumed that drinking alcohol was
a sin, and so was most everything else too, like smoking a cigarette, or wearing make-up,
or having sex, or being poor.
And Bill Wilson just copied their religion, lock, stock, and barrel.
That's why Step Four is a <i>moral</i> inventory.
And that's why Bill Wilson raved about
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">the Seven Deadly Sins
in <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i></a>.

<p>
Alas, there is not a shred of evidence to support such crazy beliefs.
Even common sense and a little observation of the human race
will tell you that sex and sloth and gluttony do not lead to alcoholism.
They may lead to obesity, but not alcoholism.

<p>
&quot;Selfishness&quot; is also not the cause of alcoholism. Now selfishness plays a part in it,
I'm sure, but still, the real causes of alcoholism are things like mental illness,
child abuse, emotional damage, chronic stress,
chronic pain from other illnesses, malnutrition,
and even the pain from how cigarette smoking is killing you. Attacking
&quot;selfishness&quot; as the prime villian in alcoholism is just flat-out
insane. But Bill Wilson was having his fun,
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">putting alcoholics down again</a>.

<p>
(Haven't you noticed how Bill Wilson hated alcoholics, and constantly slandered them?
While A.A. says that they want to reduce the stigma of alcoholism,
they actually work to increase the stigma. That's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#increase_stigma" target="_blank">another bait-and-switch trick</a>.)

<p>
A reality check
shows that A.A. just does not work as a cure for alcoholism or any other addictions.
Neither the Oxford Group nor Alcoholics Anonymous have been at all successful
in getting alcoholics to quit drinking by using such a moralistic approach.
Bill Wilson's entire business venture of selling the Oxford Group religion as
a cure for alcoholism was a failure. Well, it was a failure as a cure for alcoholism,
but it was quite profitable for Bill Wilson.
(And it is still very profitable for the treatment centers today.)

<p>
&#8212;  Which leads to hypocrisy. While Bill Wilson was ranting and raving about how selfish
all of those alcoholics were,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">he stole all of the A.A. money for himself</a>.
(As well as
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
and 
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">the women</a>,
and 
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">the glory, and the fame</a>,
and the credit.)
<p>
And hypocrisy isn't one of the Seven Deadly Sins, either.
Neither is theft. Nor is lying. Nor is hatred. As a moral code, the Seven Deadly Sins are a failure.
The Seven Deadly Sins are really just an attack on some human emotions.

Yes, other religions also criticize things like selfishness and sloth and gluttony, but
that does not mean that the Seven Deadly Sins are an okay standard, or that they cause alcoholism.
<p>

 And
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's sermon</a>
about how pride leads to alcoholism is the ravings of a certified lunatic.

<p>
About the rigidity: You noticed that people were not following the rigid rules, they were
just doing whatever they wanted to do. Yes. And that discredits the entire A.A.
program. If people can just quit drinking by doing whatever they want to do,
instead of following Bill Wilson's rules, why do A.A. recruiters continue
to tell the newcomers that they must follow the A.A. program exactly or they will die?
Why continue to claim that the 12 Steps work as a cure for alcoholism when most A.A.
members just do whatever they want to do?

<p>
Have a good day now.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) is classing
addictions as a brain disorder and disease. They claim years of
research and scores of medical experts who back the claim of the
disease model of addiction. Who is the ASAM really? Who are all these
experts and where are the results of their findings published?

Hi Orange,

<p>

&quot;Fodder for thought, this is directly lifted from the ASAM website;

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h3>Short Definition of Addiction</h3>
<p>
Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and
related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological,
psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an
individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other
behaviors.

<p>
Addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in
behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with
one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional
response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse
and remission. Without treatment or engagement in recovery activities, addiction is
progressive and can result in disability or premature death.

NIDA appears to be as big a proponent of the &quot;addiction as a disease&quot; theory, with a
Dr. Nora Valkow of NIDA (who is in the 2007 HBO &quot;Addiction&quot; documentary series).
There is all this screaming about &quot;addiction is a &quot;brain disease&quot;, but I have yet to
hear ANY MD at ANY level state: a.) here is the medically accepted definition of
what &quot;disease&quot; is (something that is taught in medical school for example!), and b.)
here is HOW &quot;addiction&quot; meets the &quot;disease definition&quot; criteria!

<p>
WHEN will THAT ever occur?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You make some really valid points there. The medical research that
shows that addiction is a &quot;brain disease&quot;, rather than a poor lifestyle choice, is zero.
At least, I haven't heard of any either, and I've been looking for a long time now.
And I've invited people, especially Steppers who believe in the disease theory, to send
me what they have. And I got nothing.

<p>
I get the same old repeated propaganda about how Dr. Silkworth said that it's &quot;a disease&quot;
&#8212;  &quot;a compulsion combined with an allergy&quot; &#8212; which is not the
definition of a disease.
And I get the token doctors who are promoters of the 12-Step cure
parroting the same old slogans and the standard party line, but
I've never seen anything resembling valid medical information that shows that
&quot;alcoholism&quot; is a &quot;disease&quot;.
No real research, no clinical tests, nothing.
<p>
It sure is a strange situation. Imagine if we treated cancer by citing the holy book of a religious
cult from the nineteen-thirties.
<p>
I'll have to investigate Dr. Valkow further. Thanks for the tip.

In Mein Kampf, Hitler wrote:

<blockquote>
But it remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood, and
their fighting comrades, the Marxists, to impute responsibility for the downfall [of
Germany in WWI] precisely to the man who alone had shown a superhuman will and
energy in his effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and to save
the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. By placing responsibility
for the loss of the world war on the shoulders of Ludendorff they took away the
weapon of moral right from the only adversary dangerous enough to be likely to
succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to Justice. All this was
inspired by the principle &#8212; which is quite true in itself &#8212; that in the big lie
there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation
are always more easily corrupted in the deeper stata of their emotional nature than
consciously or voluntarily, and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they
more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves
often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to
large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal
untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort
the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be
brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to
think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always
leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known
to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of
lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest
purposes.
<p>
From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how
falsehood and calumny can be exploited. Is not their very existence founded on one
great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, whereas in reality they are
a race? And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has
branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true.
He (Schopenhauer) called the Jew &quot;The Great Master of Lies.&quot; Those who do not
realize the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be
able to lend a hand in helping Truth to prevail.

Clearly, Hitler is not advocating the use of the &quot;Big Lie,&quot; and, far from creating
it, he in fact is ascribing the &quot;Big Lie&quot; technique to the Jews and Marxists. The
&quot;Big Lie&quot; technique is Hitler's in the same fashion that Halley's Comet is Halley's

Hello SJL,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed, because the vast masses of a nation are in the depths of their hearts more easily deceived than they are consciously and intentionally bad. The primitive simplicity of their minds renders them more easy victims of a big lie than a small one, because they themselves often tell little lies but would be ashamed to tell big ones. Such a form of lying would never enter their heads. They would never credit others with the possibility of such great impudence as the complete reversal of facts. Even explanations would long leave them in doubt and hesitation, and any trifling reason would dispose them to accept a thing as true. Something therefore always remains and sticks from the most imprudent of lies, a fact which all bodies and individuals concerned in the art of lying in this world know only too well, and therefore they stop at nothing to achieve this end.&quot;<br>

This one repeats the statement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Clearly, Hitler is not advocating the use of the &quot;Big Lie,&quot; and, far from creating it, he in fact is ascribing the &quot;Big Lie&quot; technique to the Jews and Marxists. The &quot;Big Lie&quot; technique is Hitler's in the same fashion that Halley's Comet is Halley's &#8212;  not because either man was the inventor, but rather because he was the discoverer.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>

</ul>

<p>
Notice the slightly different wording between those quotes.
The quotes begin with &quot;the size&quot;, or &quot;the greatness&quot;.
That is the same word in German: <i>die Gr&ouml;sse</i>.  Both are correct translations,
although the choice of which word to use gives the translations a different feel.
This is a very common problem with translations. It's the curse of translators.
Sometimes you have either of two English words to use, and sometimes no
word is quite correct. There are some German words that have no really correct English
equivalent. In a large translation job, you will have lots of situations where you have
several almost-correct words available, but no word that is quite right.
And in other situations, you just have to choose which of several possible words
seems the most appropriate.

<p>
I have been trying to get my hands on a German-language version of <i>Mein Kampf</i>,
to find the page number for that quote, but haven't gotten an original German copy yet.
And it turns out that I cannot download the full German-language version of <i>Mein Kampf</i>
from the Internet
because the state of Bavaria owns the copyright on <i>Mein Kampf</i>,
and they are using the copyright to prevent any further publication of
Hitler's book. The copyright will not expire until 2015.


<p>
I never said that Adolf Hitler invented the <i>Big Lie</i> technique. I said that he used it.
This is what I wrote in that
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank"><i>Propaganda Techniques</i> web page</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Big Lie is a technique that Adolf Hitler used with great success. The idea is that you just keep repeating the same lie over and over, in spite of all arguments or evidence to the contrary, until people believe it. Massive repetition is essential. (Think: &quot;Why do they keep running the same stupid commercials on TV, over and over and over again, ad nauseum?&quot;)<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm sure that people have been lying since shortly after they began to talk.
Hitler did not invent or discover that.
I can just see some caveman saying, &quot;Hey! I didn't steal your food. I didn't screw your woman.
No, not me.&quot;
The <i>Big Lie</i> technique is just a matter of telling really huge whoppers and repeating them endlessly,
until people believe them.

<p>
Like, for instance:
Ronald Reagan's &quot;Trickle-Down&quot; theory of economics:
&quot;If the rich people are allowed to get really, really, really rich,
then they will share the wealth with the rest of us by hiring us as their servants,
and we will all be happy.&quot;
<p>
Or, as 
John Maynard Keynes said,
&quot;Capitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men
for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all.&quot;


<p>
Yes, Hitler accused the Jews of lying. That is called &quot;projection&quot;. Projection is
a psychological technique where someone who is guilty of a sin or crime accuses others
of doing what he is doing. That is common behavior in cult leaders.
In <i>Mein Kampf</i>, Hitler lied like a rug, so he accused the Jews of lying like rugs.
<p>
Speaking of which, Hitler also used projection when he accused the Jews of following the
evil plans in the book
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Protocols" target="_blank"><i>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i></a>.
That forged document laid out plans for using lying and deceit to take over the world.
Well, it was Hitler, not the Jews, who used the techniques and plans in <i>The Protocols</i>
to try to take over the world.


<p>
Lastly, no, I am not the victim of some Zionist propagandists.
Hitler was so bad that the Zionists do
not have to make up false quotes about Hitler in order to make Hitler look bad.
Hitler did a fine job of that himself.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Another AAA (Atheist AAer) article:<br>

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222331/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/28/my-take-an-atheist-at-aa/?hpt=hp_c2" target="_blank">
http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/28/my-take-an-atheist-at-aa/?hpt=hp_c2</a>

<p>
BTW, it's funny that AA assumes that if you're an Atheist you
automatically assume you have a &quot;Godcode&quot;, to borrow from the video
game culture.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the tip.
<p>
Yes, that &quot;Godcode&quot; thing is standard Wilsonism. In
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
Bill Wilson made up the grandiose lie that
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">
he had gotten an education at a wonderful engineering school</a>
where he was taught that Man is God. (Just like how Bill Wilson also wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>
that
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#stock_broker" target="_blank">he was a stock broker</a>.)
<p>
Bill told the story this way: One day in the fall of 1934,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">Ebby Thacher</a>,
a fellow Burr and Burton Seminary alumnus, as well as an old drinking buddy
and a &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot;,
showed up sober and eager to recruit Bill Wilson for the Oxford Group cult.
Bill described their conversation this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then I asked him, &quot;What's this all about? You say that you
aren't drinking. But you also say you aren't on the water wagon, either.
What's up?&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Well,&quot; said Ebby, &quot;I've got religion.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What a crusher that was &#8212; Ebby and religion! Maybe his alcoholic insanity
had become religious insanity. It was an awful letdown. I had been
educated at a wonderful engineering college where somehow I had gathered
the impression that man was God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 58-59.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That wasn't true at all. Bill Wilson was not educated at
&quot;a wonderful engineering college&quot; &#8212; Bill flunked the
MIT entrance exams and didn't even get in.
So the engineering college that Bill didn't attend didn't teach him that
&quot;man was God&quot;.
<p>
Instead, Bill Wilson went to a small military academy in Vermont where he excelled at
baseball and failed to graduate.
<p>
And of course engineering schools do not really teach that Man is God.
They teach that Mother Nature is a merciless taskmaster, and if you don't do everything
just right, then your bridges will fall down, your airplanes will crash, and your
ships will sink.

<p>
So Bill says that you think you are God if you don't believe
in Bill Wilson's fascist version of God?
That is the ravings of a certified lunatic. (Not to mention a compulsive liar.)
<p>
And now we have a bunch of junior lunatics walking around parroting Bill's bull, and
claiming to be the experts on addiction. As the author of this article reported, the
recruiters often use this logical fallacy,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#frame_argument" target="_blank">framing the argument in false terms</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And not infrequently, they said, &quot;So you think you're the biggest,
most important thing in the universe?&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But Bill Wilson was not even being original. Frank Buchman and his Oxford Group cult
recruiters used the same technique, and Bill learned it from them.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Please read this article, and post it to the forum, so we can all BITCH SLAP this
alcoholic &quot;journalist&quot;! Clearly, she either does not know of your site, or is biased
against it, so she needs to be confronted as such! And there is no better ANTI-AA
AUTHORITY then YOU, Orange!

<p>
CHARGE! ;)

<font color="blue">
Hi again, John,
<p>
Yes, we were just talking about that article in the previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters258.html#John_M" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Talking about bitch-slapping her, what gets me about the story is how
she accurately reports how intolerant and bigotted the other A.A. members are, and how
they accuse her of thinking that she is &quot;the biggest, most important thing in the universe&quot;
because she doesn't believe in their superstitions,
and yet, she still has only good things to say about A.A., and praises it as accepting all.
What the heck? Talk about blindness.
What part of religious bigotry does she not understand?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
