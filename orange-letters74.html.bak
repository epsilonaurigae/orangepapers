Subject:  	Invitation to an open meeting in Sag Harbor, New York<br>

<p>

Hi A. Orange

<p>

How about seeing what a real open meeting is about, where in fact there are
atheists, agnostics, Buddhists, evangelicals and all manner of spiritual
beliefs represented every Friday night in a tolerant, compassionate and safe
place to grow and share?

<p>

Come on A. Orange, test the hypothesis...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Michael,
<p>
Apparently you haven't read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction to the web site, here</a>.
I have been to a zillion A.A. and N.A. meetings, including one where one nice lady
shared what she thought spirituality means, in a sensible and humble manner,
immediately followed by a nutcase who raved about how the 12 Steps are a gift from God and
he is overwhelmed by what a genius Bill Wilson was to have invented 12 perfect steps that
could <i>solve all of the problems of the world</i>.

<p>
Worst of all, even the nicest meetings are started by reading Bill Wilson's official lies from
pages 58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>. It seems like A.A. just cannot and will not start
a meeting by really telling the truth.

<p>
I don't need to go to any more meetings to see &quot;the real A.A.&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Date:  	Sun, September 24, 2006 7:47 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Steve B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	To Whom it May Concern<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

First let me compliment you on your web site. It is by far the most
comprehensive dissection of A.A. that I have ever come across.

<p>

However, what you may not understand is that some alcoholics need to be
controlled because they just cannot control themselves. They are truly
incapable of thinking for themselves and are often very rebellious. They
do not want to be told that they have to give up their present higher
power (the lizard-mind addiction monster). And if there isn't something
to replace it then they will feel lost and eventually go back to their
addiction monster. For some it's like trying to take a security blanket
away from a child, so you have to spoon feed them a program that will
essentially hold their hand for the rest of their lives. This is much
better than spending years in prison for vehicular manslaughter for them
and especially for their possible future victims. Even if you have to
brain wash these addicts in believing in the Easter bunny to get them to
stop drinking and/or using, this is for their own good and you would be
pressed to find any law abiding citizen that would have something
against doing what ever it takes to get these people to stop the
insanity.

<p>

I agree that there should be some professional evaluation to determine
any possible brain damage, mental retardation, schizophrenia,
psychopathy and so forth among addicts to determine the best treatment
for that individual. However this should be the responsibility of the
courts. And then if no mental illness is found they should be mandated
to enter treatment given a chose between a faith-based program, such as
A.A., and a non-faith based program such as Hampstead Hospital Rational
Recovery Program.

<p>

What your site is doing is denouncing a program without coming up with
any alternative program. Nor do you offer any education about
alcoholism, such as why some people are predisposed to becoming
alcoholics.

<p>

There is a good book out by Jerry Dorsman,
titled &quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Dorsman">How to Quit Drinking
Without AA</a>&quot;. I am not affiliated with the book at all, I just happened
to have read it and found that it was what helped me.

<p>

Let me also say that I have not read your entire site (you have a lot of
material) so I might be wrong about you not having an education page. So
I'm still reading your page on my spare time. I am curious to know how
long it has taken you to comprise your web site.

<p>

Hope you did not mind this critique.
<p>
Thanks, Steve

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
No, I don't mind a critique at all. I welcome all kinds of thoughts and inputs, especially when
somebody is actually thinking, rather than just parrotting cult dogma.
<p>
Starting at the top, I have a lot of big questions about the whole concept of alcoholics needing
supervision and somebody to tell them what to do. Has there been any real research on this subject?
While it may seem sensible to supervise newly-detoxed alcoholics and prevent them from drinking,
does it actually work to produce greater long-term sobriety?
<p>
Have there really been any <i>randomized longitudinal controlled studies</i> to test whether
tight control and supervision works to <i>make</i> alcoholics get and stay sober?
<p>
This question is of course a lot more than just of academic importance. It's a life-or-death issue
for a lot of people.
<p>
What I have seen is not encouraging. It seems like those who are going to relapse do so anyway.
Some of them might wait until they get out of &quot;the program&quot;, but they still relapse anyway.

<p>
My own father provides a case study. He crawled back from Mexico with &quot;burning veins&quot;.
He had been living off of his military retirement checks down there for a few years,
living like a king and killing himself with huge quantities of cheap rotgut whiskey.
When he finally came back to the USA, he had so much alcohol
in his blood that it was literally burning the insides of his veins.
<p>
He ended up in a Christian monastery in Arizona where they taught him to yammer slogans about Jesus,
&quot;getting closer to Him&quot;, and all of that.
He stayed there for two years, living a real monastic life. Then he left to go get a straight job
in the outside world. He stopped in at a bar to get a drink to bolster his nerves for the job
interview, and that was that. He never made it to the job interview. (He made it back to Mexico
for another couple of years of suicidal drinking.)
He didn't last one day outside, on his own, supervising himeself.
The monastery may have taught him to stay sober while he had a boss who constantly
supervised him and told him not to drink,
but that monastic program apparently did nothing for teaching him to supervise himself,
and keep himself sober.
<p>
A.A. has the same problem. A.A. cannot supervise people 24x7.
A bossy, dogmatic, hard-core Stepper supervisor is no guarantee of sobriety.
In fact, when all is said and done,
A.A. still produces no more sobriety than the other people get who go it alone and do it all on their own.

<p>
I just have not seen any good research on the subject of rigid control and supervision, one way or the other
&#8212; especially not tests that follow the subjects for a year or two to see whether they <i>stay</i> sober
after the rigid supervision ends.
<p>
I can only guess that while a short program of regimented life may be helpful to keep people
from relapsing during the first few months when they are new to sobriety and shakey, in the
long run, it doesn't work, or at least it doesn't improve on the situation any.
<p>
All of the so-called alcoholism treatment programs have the same problem: They get a small temporary
success rate in getting people to quit drinking for a month or two, followed by the &quot;graduates&quot;
relapsing left and right, until at the one-year point, there is no difference between those
alcoholics who got &quot;treatment&quot;, and those who didn't.

<p>
So what is the answer for the people who simply will always relapse if they are not strictly regimented
and controlled?
Concentration camps for alcoholics, where they will spend the rest of their lives?
That question is not a joke. Really, do we let them kill themselves,
or do we imprison them for their own good?
Do we really believe in freedom?

<p>
Oh, and rigid supervision does not mean that newly-detoxed alcoholics should get cult dogma
and A.A. misinformation passed off as &quot;education about alcoholism&quot;.
The A.A. beliefs about alcoholism are grossly wrong, and should not be shoved on anybody,
under any guise.

<p>
I know about the book &quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Dorsman">How to Quit Drinking
Without AA</a>&quot;. I added it to the bibliography a couple of years ago.
(Click on the book name.) I read it so
long ago that I have basically forgotten what it said. My own notes on it say that it is good,
and gives another slant on alcoholism, although I don't use its recommended techniques.

<p>
About complaining that I criticize existing programs without supplying an alternative:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First, I am not required to supply an alternative. I can criticize
and denounce completely useless quack cures for cancer and AIDS
without having to supply a working cure, can't I? Is alcoholism any different there?
We should all denounce quackery, whenever and whereever we see it.
And we don't have to provide an alternative treatment.

<p>
<li> Secondly, we (correspondents and I) are constantly talking about
what else works, and what has helped people,
and what kinds of things people did to get and stay sober. The letters section is loaded with
people's stories about what is working for them, and I'm always inviting more.
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works">Look here</a> for one list of such discussions.
</ol>

<p>

Your statement that alcoholics should be given a choice between a faith-based program like A.A., 
or Rational Recovery, is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy">
false dichotomy</a>.
That is, it's a false choice. Alcoholics Anonymous is not a faith-based program, it
is a superstitious dishonest cult religion. Things like the Catholic Calix and St. Vincent DePaul programs
are faith-based approaches to the problem.
A.A. is a cult that is based on lies. There is a huge difference there.

<p>
Likewise, you wrote,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Nor do you offer any education about
alcoholism, such as why some people are predisposed to becoming
alcoholics.&quot;
</font>
<p>

Jeez Loise! How many times do I have to say it?
We have talked endlessly about the
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">genetic factors</a>,
psychological factors, child abuse, bitter divorces, deaths, and other negative life experiences,
and how those things do or might contribute to alcoholism.
We have had quite a long discussion about what causes alcoholism, and it is far from over.
<p>
I've been working on this web site for almost 6 years now, from the first rudimentary paper
about Alcoholics Anonymous that turned into a long paper that turned into the original postings
on Apple's &quot;AA Deprogramming&quot; web site, to my own successive web sites.
(And I don't know when it will end.)
<p>
Have a good day.

Date:  	Mon, September 25, 2006 11:08 am<br>
From:  	h.<br>
Subject:  	this and that<br>

<p>

Dear Orange:

<p>

Just a few thoughts.

<p>

I am sure that I repeat myself.

<p>

AA is about &quot;dis empowerment&quot;.  When one joins AA, a person surrenders personal
autonomy.  The question begged is:  What does AA gain?  The question needs to be
asked:  Qui bono?  Does AA need people to be vulnerable?  It is not a question of AA
zealotry; it is a question of AA being a patholical organization which needs
&quot;weakness&quot;?

<p>

AA gains &#8212; a great deal.

<p>

A sponsor gains.  A sponsor when they help someone else, help themselves.  The
sponsor is the driver; not, the newcomer.  It is not a case of the sponsor saying:
these are your choices:  doing it on your own; choosing amoung options; and these
are several of your options:  AA, SMART, SOS, LifeRing, etc.  That is not done.  The
concept of informed consent does not exist.
<p>
Thus, a sponsor needs sponsor someone; for his own needs.  There are no
qualifications worthy of the name in order to be a sponsor.

<p>

Does AA have guidelines?

<p>

What is the relatonship between the SAT industry and AA?

<p>

Who is the driver?

<p>

I must say that I think that AA is a pathological oranization which uses human
vulnerabity to get new members.  I do not consider it necessary to call it a &quot;cult&quot;

<p>

It is, imho, a patholical organization which has a gained a reputation for
&quot;helping suffering alcoholics&quot;.  But, the means that are employed are
quite obvious forms of emotional blackmail.  The methods employed are, quite
clearly, geared to the most vulnerable.

<p>

That may go some way toward describing why 5% remain after one year.

<p>

Thank you for your site!!!  It is a breath of fresh air.

<p>

The current state of the SAT industry reminds me of leeches.  At one time, the
medical profession believed in bleeding; in the fulness of time, 12 step and AA
may go the way of leeches.!  Perhaps wrong death lawsuits may change matters.

<p>

Owing to the state of things, I must be anonymous.

<p>

Call me    &quot;H&quot; only.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, H.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That's some stuff to think about.
<p>
Have a good day.

I left AA because I realised I could not change it but I can help others see

As for Orange I can't speak for him, but I don't think he is that interested

some hand-written scribblings on some old piece of paper?  What on earth is he talking about?
<p>
The five percent number came from quite a variety of sources:
<ol>
<li> Bill Wilson's secretary
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Nell_Wing4">Nell Wing wrote</a> that A.A. &quot;could only help 5%&quot;.
<li> Lois Wilson's secretary
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses">Francis Hartigan reported</a> that Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob calculated
that they had only a 5% success rate in recruiting and sobering up alcoholics.
<li> The Australian A.A. leader said that they too had a 95% dropout rate in the first year &#8212;
that only 5% remained after a year.
<li> Professor George E. Vaillant, who is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">likewise reported</a>
that only 5% of his A.A.-treated patients
got sober and stayed sober through the 8-year duration of his study.
</ol>
<p>
The fact that 10 of that guy's friends got sober and stayed sober (for 1 year)
is not an indication of the A.A. success rate. That is what you call a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#semiattached">Semi-Attached Figure</a>.
The writer did not mention how many failures there were. There were ten successes, but how many
hundreds of failures happened at the same time?
The writer ignores that.
The same question applies to the &quot;30 people from 3 meetings&quot;.
How many dropouts and relapses did those 3 A.A. groups have during the 3 years
that the 30 people were sober?

<p>
Pointing to a few success stories does not establish a <i>rate</i>. A <i>rate</i> is &quot;something
per something else&quot;, like miles per hour, or sober successes per 100 newcomers.
<p>
Thanks for the input. And have a good day.

<p>

Dear Sir, I have just found your papers online about AA. And although I have not
read it in its entirety (perhaps in your papers you answer my question)  I have
been wondering what prompted you to write such a thorough and in depth article,
expos&eacute; &#8212; into the beginnings of AA?

<p>

Sincerely, Scott S.

Hello Scott,
<p>
The funny answer is that I didn't really intend to write such a web site. I only intended
to write one paper, much like a term paper, maybe 30 or 40 pages double-spaced,
about Alcoholics Anonymous and why it is inappropriate
to use A.A. (or N.A.) as &quot;treatment&quot; for alcoholism. The thing just kind of grew and grew.

Date:  	Wed, September 27, 2006 3:08 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;John M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	adios for now; originally &quot;is this socially harmful&quot;<br>

<p>

Hi, I'll apologize in advance for the length of this letter, but at
least you won't have to write a lengthy reply!  I have my alcoholism
back under control for the first time in five years.  Prior to this I
had had 19 years of sobriety without using A.A. (I got clean in a
residential 12 month, non-12 step therapy program).  I started
relapsing five years ago and now have had a total of four relapses
each of only a few months duration and each progressively shorter
than the one before.  My last relapse was almost six months ago  and
only lasted a week; though I almost managed to kill myself the last
day by falling and hitting my head so hard.  I have never been big on
AA. and so probably would not have stayed whether I heard of you or
not; (actually I ran into your website by plugging in &quot;Anti-
Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; which shows you where my head was at).
<p>
I have
already &quot;qualified&quot; in a prior letter so that other readers could not
dismiss me as not really an alcoholic so do not need to be
redundant.  I want to comment on what I have learned about myself and
my experience for the benefit of others.  Much of what I have learned
revolves around what you call the &quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">lizard brain</a>&quot; model. I will
henceforth refer to my base brain thoughts as &quot;LB&quot; . (this sounds
anthropomorphic but I do realize that LB is an integral part of me
and not some &quot;devil made me do it&quot; outside force but for the sake of
simplicity I will refer to LB as if it were a distinct non-integrated
part of my psych).
<p>
When I got out of rehab I was 25 years old and I
intentionally started finding and doing things that I enjoyed to do
(AA was not one of them), I have lots of interests and many of them
revolved around physical activities; running, the beach, going to the
gym, hiking, traveling, meditating and playing piano, to name just a
few; most of these are incompatible with being drunk or with smoking
which I also quit on my own when I was 26. After a few years of
living with the only slogan AA says worth remembering; &quot;Don't drink
no matter what&quot;, LB started to realize that the only pleasures he was
going to get were these new &quot;fun&quot; activities.  I also went out to
clubs,bars, discos etc. almost immediately after getting out of rehab
to meet people and never had any desire to drink as LB was kept under
control with the promise of &quot;sex and a good time&quot;.
<p>
Like I said
after two years LB seemed to have gone into hibernation in regards to
both alcohol and tobacco (which I haven't had a craving for in 22
years) and had to make do with new pleasures; I was to the point
where I could have bathed in alcohol and it would never have occured
to me to drink.  But LB is patient.  after 19 years of not drinking I
was in Italy and the waiter brought over an after dinner shot of
something along with dessert and LB went berserk; after 19 years
surely I could have one little shot etc... and this time I did.  The
problem was that it was no big deal.  I didn't go on a spree or get
so drunk I was kicked out of Italy or anything; I actually didn't
have another drink for several weeks when I had &quot;two shots&quot; and LB
was patiently fucking me over because it was several months before LB
had me back as a full blown &quot;drunk every night&quot; alcoholic; but the
full blown period only lasted a couple of weeks and ironically I
think that I have to thank LB for this; since drinking was
incompatible with my other joys in life LB played it safe and I only
drank just before I went to bed and got as fucked up as I could and
went to sleep to sleep it off.  Each time I got to the point that I
drank before just going to bed was the last drinking day of the
relapse; this was because I couldn't do the other things in life that
LB got joy out of (not to the intense degree of alcohol but at a much
steadier supply).
<p>
Then I would go for a year or more and relapse
again; it took me four relapses to figure out the problem; when I
first quit drinking I knew that there was no way that I could have
only one drink and stop there.  LB was clever and patient; after 19
years of sobriety he introduced the concept of &quot;controlled
drinking&quot;.  This I believe is the reason for the three additional
relapses; it took me almost five years to realize it was only an
illusion of control and it got me to the same place after a month or
so; complete alcoholism.
<p>
Now that I know this I am back to where I
was before I started relapsing; I don't think about drinking alcohol
anymore than it would occur to me to drink clorox. Life is good; I am
back to an agreement with LB, he has to make do with the smaller
doses of pleasure that are a day to day occurence because he will
kill both of us if he insists that I drink.  I feel that my battle is
once again over and done with.  I don't believe that A.A. is socially
good for you even if you don't believe the bullshit as you are doing
nothing to keep either you or LB entertained and furthermore you are
sitting around in a room doing nothing but discussing the one thing
you should be trying to get over.
<p>
Like I said I will probably not be writing to you anymore, though I
will continue to read your website; you are doing a great service to
people helping them understand themselves and what can and can't help
them.  I can't resist a few comments parting comments;
<p>
<ul>
<li> 1) Dry
Drunks; if a drunk is defined as someone who is perpetually under the
influence of alcohol then surely a &quot;dry drunk&quot; must be someone who is
perpetually thinking about alcohol (sound like any group you know
of?),
<p>
<li> 2) There are no coincidences; I had no idea that you were into
ducks and swans until I was reading your letters one day just after I
had first quit going to meetings and had spent the hour that I would
have been at the meeting watching a pair of bluejays chasing away
every bird that came by their tree including a hawk, and thinking to
myself that this had given me more pleasure than any hour of AA could
possibly have. Then I looked up your site and you were talking about
the
&quot;<a href="orange-letters56.html#daily_meeting">daily meeting</a>&quot;
down by the river. In AA this would have been
perceived of as divine intervention; but no, it was merely a flukey
coincidence, these things happen all the time.
<p>
<li> 3) Birthdays in AA;
talk about giving away your fundamentalist roots, I wasn't &quot;born
again&quot; when I quit drinking. I celebrate &quot;anniversaries&quot; of sobriety.

<p>
<li> And finally 4) Spirituality; although you address this in your papers
about seances etc.. I don't think you state clearly enough that the
word has a significantly different meaning since the late sixties
than it did in the 1930's.  In neither case does it rule out
religion, but prior to the late 1960's spiritualism generally
referred to an adherent of &quot;spiritualism&quot; complete with a belief
system of divine and spiritual intervention, seances, ouiji boards,
ectoplasm etc.   After the late 60's the term generally started
referring to a belief  in the more mystical aspects that all
religions share; a &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;, a feeling of belonging or
of  at being &quot;one&quot; with nature and other people, and sometimes an
annoying (to me at least) belief in new age philosophy. It does not
refer to God directing your every thought, action etc..  I don't know
if  AA actually uses this change of meaning as a bait and switch
consciously or not but they certainly don't emphasize the different
meaning that William Wilson (and my grandmother) had with the word
than most people today have.

</ul>
<p>

Finally and oddly; I happen to be gay,
I went to about an equal number of straight versus gay meetings those
first three months; when I see people from straight meetings they
usually act like they have no idea who I am or if they do talk to me
it is in a very condescending way, most of the gay AA members seem
genuinely pleased to see me and hear that I am fine.  Can't figure
out why except that maybe growing up in a society that tells you so
many hateful lies about yourself make gay AA members a little less
able to swallow any totalitarian generalizations like those offered
in AA.
<p>
Well like I said it's long but you won't be hearing from me again
(maybe I'll run a short anniversary letter to you but  am actually
trying my best to intentionally forget the date as I think people put
too much significance on it.
<p>
Thanks for assisting me in clearing up my thinking; Be good and keep
your LB full with the many pleasures of life.
<p>

Hi John,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations on your victories. It sounds good.
And thanks for the compliments.
<p>
That is a very perceptive point you make about the changing meaning of the word &quot;spirituality&quot;.
Of course the psychedelic revolution of the sixties changed the meaning of the word.
I sort of knew that, but it didn't consciously occur to me just how different the word has become.
Bill Wilson and the A.A. members of the 'thirties just were not coming from the same place
as the Baby Boomers are, and the word doesn't mean the same thing to all of us.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#ouija">Bill Wilson's spiritism</a>
&#8212; complete with ouija boards and spirit rapping &#8212;
strikes me as the worst sort of superstitious nonsense, and not &quot;spiritual&quot; at all.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

From:  	&quot;susan m.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: A.A.'s approach<br>

<p>

To:  A. Orange,

<p>

Happened totally by accident upon your &quot;<a href="orange-letters22.html">Letters22</a>.&quot;

<p>

Oddly enough, I've been going to A.A. for two months.  This has not been my first
time there.  I've relapsed many times.

<p>

Within the past week, I've had an uncomfortable feeling while reading the B.B.  I
initially needed the freedom to interpret God or a Higher Power, as I understood
him.  I still need it.  I'm involved presently in a Step Study within A.A.  It is
Week Five and we are at the Chapter in the BB entitled &quot;More on Alcoholism.&quot;  One
of our Step Study questions asks us to stress whether we are either going to live
with God in our lives or not.  We have to answer yes or no.

<p>

I'm feeling pressured by this.  I don't want to become 'religious.'  Well, to be
completely honest, (an A.A. trait, LOL,) I dont' 'think' I want to become involved
in an organized religion per se, but the bottom line is that I want the time and
the understanding (my own,) to think further on it and conclude what I believe.  I
don't want a certain page in any book telling me I must decide to turn my life
over to God right there and then.

<p>

It has truly been feeling liking I'm being asked to become a Bible Thumper and no,
I don't, thank you very much.

<p>

In saying this, I do find peace amongst the rooms of A.A.  As long as I can think
of a Higher Power in the vein I wish, (which for me is non-religious, but
spiritual) I am fine.  But asking for my complete will?  My gut has been telling
me NO.

<p>

So, interesting that I came across your site by accident.  I was googling to learn
more about a T-Bill (in financial terms,) and it took me to your Letters22 page!
Coincidence?  I feel there's got to be some relevance in the fact I stumbled upon
your site!  Either I'm being lead into some evil anti-A.A. den, or the God of my
understanding is 'showing'  me  (by way of your site,) it's okay to question Bill
W.!!

<p>

Bottom line,  I am writing because I wanted to ask you something.  I hope you
don't mind giving me an answer.  Are you an alcoholic, and if so, have you
yourself tried A.A.?

<p>

Thank you.

<p>

Susan M.

Subject:  	freedom from AA &#8212; thanks for the help!<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
As I write, I am presently celebrating my zero-and-540 (18 months without a
meeting... can't give up the cheesy slogans).  I should say it is something
of an accomplishment because I am now alcohol and drug free for 15 years and
much of that time was spent around AA.  At 21, I could see that my
alcoholism was not a passing phase that I would grow out of.  I never felt
'powerless' about my lifestyle and the decisions that I made around
drinking,  but once I had a few in me, all bets were off.  Whenever I
started drinking, it's like a switch would flip.  I would crave alcohol the
way a starving man craves food.  I could occasionally resist the craving
just as a prisoner on hunger strike might resist food (brain overriding the
body), but over the long haul, the craving would always win.  I was a
college student, I loved the lifestyle, I had a lot of fun and I didn't want
the party to stop.  Consequently, I spent a long time trying to convince
myself that I could beat the craving and drink in a socially acceptable
manner.  By the time I hit 21, I was convinced otherwise.  I knew that the
physical craving would only be relieved by total abstinence from alcohol.  I
came to that conclusion entirely on my own.  Nobody ever suggested that I
quit drinking or seek out treatment.  At my age, most people figured that I
was just in a phase and would emerge soon enough as a responsible adult.
I'm glad I stopped when I did and cringe at the thought of what might have
been.  Anyway, both of my parents stopped drinking in AA long ago.  Neither
of them were actively going to meetings when I asked for help, but they
thought it would be a good idea for me to go to AA so that I could
meet sober people who would support me in my decision not to drink.  I
didn't want to go.  I had read a little about AA and saw that it was a
'spiritual' program which did not interest or make sense to me at all.
I had never considered myself an atheist, but I didn't feel that an
imaginary friend was what I needed to solve my problems.  To make a long
story short, I went to a meeting shortly after I stopped drinking and
continued to go for the next 13 years with varying levels of
involvement.  Fortunately, I am one of those lucky souls who never had a
relapse.  I attribute my success to having drawn my own conclusions without
having any reservations whatsoever.

<p>
The reason I am writing is that I see a lot of people bashing you and your
website.  Granted, you are a tad bitter about certain subjects, but I find
your rants to be both refreshing and entertaining.  I have enjoyed many
hours reading the orange papers and the letter correspondence that
accompanies them.  Keep up the good work.  I have literally been to
thousands of meetings.  I have worked the steps with a Big
Book thumping sponsor. I have sponsored people.  I have been involved in the
service structure.  I have made coffee.  I have chaired meetings.  I have
volunteered at jails and institutions.  I have been to conferences and
conventions.  I've also been the guy who sits in the back and says nothing.
I've been the guy that openly dissents from the standard dogma.  I've been
the guy who dares to have a life without utter abandonment to AA.  I can
tell you that many of the negatives presented in the orange papers are
consistent with what I've seen in my AA tenure.  Unfortunately, AA does harm
some people.  I've seen people ridiculed for not believing what they have
been 'suggested' to believe.  I've seen people degraded for not doing the
things have been 'suggested' to them.  I have seen AA's holier-than-thou
attitudes chase people away. These suffering alcoholics are probably better
off without AA, but in the meantime, they have been demoralized more then
they were prior to arriving at AA.  I've seen sponsors give out advice on
subjects that they have no business advising people on.  I've seen more
cases of the self-fulfilling prophesy than I can count.  People are told
that their life can 'hardly be a success' without a higher power.  People
are told that the precursor to relapse is a decline in meeting attendance.
Guess what?  Some people are never going to believe in a personal higher
power that can solve their problems.  Some people are never going to fit in
at meetings no matter how 'open minded'  they are and how much they 'keep
coming back'.   I know that members and meetings have their own
personalities, but it is very rare that a newcomer will hear something along
these lines: &quot;You know what?  AA doesn't have all the answers and this might
not be right for you.  Maybe you should try an alternative to the 12 steps.
Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;  Instead, 99.9% of the time, the
newcomer is simply told that hard work, honesty, service and a willingness
to believe in a higher power is all that is required.

<p>
My eyes were opened in January of 2003.  I was working on my taxes and was
wondering if the dollars that I put in the meeting basket could be claimed
as a charitable deduction.  I decided to look on the intranet.  This was the
first time I had ever keyed 'alcoholics anonymous' into a search engine.  I
found all kinds of articles on AA, both pro and con.  Among the articles
that I chose to read was the orange papers.  In the orange papers, I found
many of my own dissenting thoughts written out in cyberspace.  I had read
all of the conference approved AA 'history' books, but never anything that
provided a dissenting point of view.  From my beginnings in AA, I internally
challenged the spiritual approach to recovery, but for the most part kept my
ideas to myself.  I had done all of the steps and gone to big book studies
over the years, but never felt quite right about it.  When sponsoring
people, I couldn't make myself present the 'AA message' in good conscience.
I often told people that they should find a spiritual sponsor if
spirituality was something that was important to them.  I always seemed to
gravitate towards people that weren't AA extremists.  Whenever I shared, I
could only talk about real life experiences.  I never got that 'inner peace
of knowing God'.  During a two year stint as my home group's GSR, I had the
privilege of meeting many of AA's finest.  To this day, I think the AA
service elite are some of the most dysfunctional people I have ever met.  At
the time, I liked to refer to them as acquaintances of circumstance.  Why
would someone who has double digit sobriety still go to a meeting every day,
sponsor 10+ people and spend 3 out of 4 weekends at some type of service
function?  I understand being grateful for sobriety and giving back, but at
what point does a person need to get on with life?  Where's the balance?
Why is it so important that the 12 step religion be spread to all ends of
the earth and why is it that a select few dictate exactly how it be done?

<p>
I eventually left AA.  All along, my motivation for going was to have a
sober support group.  At 15 years, many of my friends had moved on (family
life, etc) and at the risk of sounding condescending, the newcomers were a
little rough around the edges to be my new sober pals.  That being said, the
social aspect of AA wasn't what it once was for me.  In addition, I never
genuinely bought into the 'solution'.  I tried to tell myself that AA's
steps were just suggestions.  I lived by the motto 'take what you need and
leave the rest'.  AA's most sacred text said otherwise.  Almost every
meeting I've ever attended is started with a prayer and a reading of 'How it
Works'.  It is pretty hard to interpret &quot;There is one who has all
power...that one is God...may you find him now!&quot; as a suggestion.  The
chapters that precede this statement tell me that an alcoholic must decide
between almost certain death and a spiritual way of life.  How can I
disagree with such a basic tenet of the program and still call myself a
member of AA?  This would equate to a Catholic who doesn't believe that
Jesus Christ was the messiah.  For a while, I stuck around AA and tried to
pitch an alternative message.  This made the true believers angry.  I was
'diluting' message.  Finally, I had had enough.  I left.  I'm happy.  Maybe
I'll return someday, but I doubt it.

Subject:  	12 step programs<br>

<p>

A. Orange &#8212;

<p>

I just read your article called the &quot;effectiveness of twelve step
treatment.&quot;  Although I've been in NA for over ten years, no physical
relapses, I agree with some of what you propose. Statistical arguments,
though, are always capable of being skewed to prove a point or start
from a fallacious premise or limited sample, so I don't give that too
much weight. And the examples you gave based on your Murphy's Law
corollary, &quot;The thing you seek always seems to be in the last place that
you look,&quot; seems a bit simplistic.  I did go to a D&amp;A rehab facility for
28 days.  I have gone to many meeting over the years and tried to
conduct myself in accordance with certain principles and guidelines that
really anyone could put to use in their lives.  I also try to weed out
the AA and NA bullcrap, too.  But it was the first &quot;place I looked&quot; and
it has been, so far, the last &quot;place&quot; I looked, BECAUSE IT HAS WORKED
for me.  I was not a person who was going to go into to some
&quot;spontaneous remission&quot; any time soon.  I needed something to encourage
me, to tell me it was going to be allright, even when things looked
their darkest.  That was not going to happen &quot;spontaneously&quot; for me.  My
so-called &quot;remission&quot; is the result of a type of treatment that for me
worked, called NA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I disagree about what has worked for you.
What really worked was your will power &#8212; the strength of your resolve to just not
dope or drink any more.
The 12-Step program would obviously be totally useless if you had not decided to quit your unhealthy habits,
and then really done it.
<p>
Why did you go into a treatment program? Because you had already decided to change your life for the better.
THAT is the magic that does it.
</font>
<p>

But I still find your article most fascinating, because at heart I'm
still somewhat of a rebel and a skeptic, even when it comes to NA.  But
I can't knock what works, so there isn't much point in seeking something
else, is there?  I don't know, maybe there is.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">assuming a cause-and-effect relationship</a>
where none exists.
</font>
<p>


It is true that NA
doesn't work for everyone &#8212; but I've seen many aspects of that story:
people who it DOES really work for, that when they put some effort into
their own treatment, they can have great non-spontaneous success &#8212; they
were most certainly NOT going to get better &quot;anyway.&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are still doing it. You do not know whether they would have quit in some other program,
or by going it alone. People do just suddenly quit their self-destructive habits when they
get fed up with the suffering and pain. You did. I did. Millions of people do.
</font>
<p>



And others, even
if they do seemingly put the effort into their NA or AA &quot;treatment,&quot;
were not going to go into &quot;spontaneous remission&quot; &#8212; and they don't &#8212; and
they either continue to suffer or they find something other than 12 step
recovery that does work for them &#8212; that's great.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are confusing the issues. If they go to treatment, then by definition, their recovery
is not &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;.
Spontaneous remission is when people just recover, all on their own, without any
&quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;program&quot;.
</font>
<p>

And then there are
those, as you point out, that go to NA or AA and were going to get
better anyway, &quot;spontaneously&quot; but believe it was because of the 12
steps.  Is this such a bad thing?  No one really knows the percentages
of how many addicts fall into what category &#8212; and does it really matter?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it matters immensely, because quacks and fake healers are taking in over $6 billion per year
for &quot;treating&quot; alcoholism and drug addiction with cult religion.
That is felony fraud, and sucks real money out of the health care system.
</font>
<p>

I do what works.  But your right, if it's not working for me any more &#8212;
I should not be so closed-minded that I can't conceive of trying
something else.  It's just that, up 'till now, I haven't had to.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you don't know what works.
</font>
<p>

I might add, for your benefit, that your view of powerlessness is a bit
misguided.  Sure some people may use that as an &quot;excuse&quot; to drink more,
after they have relapsed once.  But that's not about powerlessness, it's
about the power of addiction.  Addicts are indeed powerless over the
addictive substances that they crave: drugs (which includes alcohol),
and other behaviors. When it comes to these things, &quot;will power&quot; alone
just does not work.  That's the whole point.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And that is simply not true. That is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless">Bill Wilson's baloney</a>
about how you can't quit drinking
without joining his cult and surrendering yourself to &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
</font>
<p>

<a name="disservice"> </a>
They get into trouble as
soon as they start thinking that they can have some sort of &quot;control&quot;
over their drug use, whether it be pain-killers, booze, pot, coke,
heroin, whatever, even gambling, sex, food, etc..  Telling addicts that
simply their own will power will conquer their addiction does them a
great disservice.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Prove that statement. Show me the evidence. I mean really.
<a href="orange-letters73.html#disservice">Once again, I am hearing the standard Stepper line</a>
about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are doing a great disservice to those who are seeking sobriety&quot;</font>,
without a shred of evidence to back up that statement.
<p>
What medical study or survey showed that addicts cannot use their will power to quit doping or drinking?
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Now whether they will <b>choose</b> to do so is another question &#8212; a very different question.</i>
</font>
<p>
And who established that telling the truth to addicts is doing them a disservice?<br>
I mean really, where did that come from, besides
from the very common, very usual, cult dogma that says that
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_no_truth">You can't tell the truth</a>&quot;?
</font>
<p>

However, addicts ARE NOT powerless over many aspects
of their life, just like anyone else.  Think of it like this: I am (as
are you) POWERLESS over the weather.  I can't make it stop raining
anytime I want it to.  But that doesn't mean that I'm so powerless that
I have to be an idiot and stand out in the rain and get soaked.  There
ARE different things I can do to keep from getting wet.  I can open up
my umbrella, if I have one.  I can ask someone else if I can share their
umbrella, if I don't have one and they do.  I can come inside, under
shelter, out of the rain.  I have the power to do SOMETHING other than
to just stand there and get drenched.  So it is for some addicts.  Their
suffering from active addiction is like the rain.  They see the shelter
of NA or AA and they come in, out of the rain, so to speak, and they
don't have to suffer any more.  Or they may see the shelter of some
other kind of treatment or program that is not 12 step based.  Or
religion, or psychiatry.  If those things work for them, that's great.
Either way, they have the power to avail themselves of these solutions.
They are certainly NOT powerless to do something about their drinking.
That's NOT what 12 step recovery says. And anyone who tells you
otherwise is disingenuous about powerlessness.

<p>

John L.,<br>
Malvern, PA

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, addicts can &quot;come in out of the rain&quot; by just not
consuming any more drugs or drinks. (And by quitting smoking.) It's very simple.

<p>
It was
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless">Bill Wilson, the A.A. founder, who promoted the
&quot;powerless&quot; concept</a>.
He was the &quot;disingenuous&quot; character who said that you were powerless over alcohol,
and just couldn't help but relapse now and then because you would suffer
from strange &quot;mental blank spots&quot;
where your &quot;defenses against drinking&quot; would give way before some silly thought,
and you would just start drinking and be off on a binge before you even knew what was happening.
<p>
So the <i>ONLY</i> answer was to join a cult religion and surrender to God, and hope that God
feels like saving your worthless ass.

<p>
And again, you are assuming that 12-Step programs actually work and make people recover.
That is a false assumption.
<p>
Show me the evidence. Show me the data. What is the recovery rate in Narcotics Anonymous, or Alcoholics
Anonymous? How many success stories (clean and sober for oh, say, 5 years) do you get out of each
1000 newcomers? How does that compare to the normal spontaneous remission rate in addictions?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

S. A. Orange &#8212;

<p>
When I read your article earlier today about &quot;effectiveness of the 12
steps, etc.&quot;, I thought you were actually a serious scholar, or at least
very good at faking it.  But now I just read your Orange jokes,
Ungroupism, etc.  Funny, but profoundly sad at the same time.  You come
off as an angry, isolated individual.  And seemingly an asantaclauseist
or some kind of agnostic, at any rate.  Please don't be ridiculing the
power of Santa Clausian prayer.  It works!  And cleaning out one's
garage is very therapeutic.  Cleaning out one's cluttered mind, maybe
more so.  But be careful of those old gasoline and oil rags, you may end
up with spontaneous combustion, I mean remission.

<p>
In truth, you sound like a rather closed-minded &quot;tearer-downer&quot; (r),
rather than a &quot;builder-upper (r).&quot;   I'll admit you writings are
moderately entertaining, in a sort of perverse way.  So keep up the
mediocre work.

I understand it perfectly. I simply reject the Alcoholics Anonymous dogma.

Addicts have no will power ON THEIR OWN, that's the whole point.  That's
what addiction is.  I know this to be true.  I have no will power.  And

I didn't &quot;decide&quot; anything of the kind.  Left to my own devices, I would
have kept using.  And you are doing a great disservice when you try and
pass that &quot;will power&quot; baloney off as some kind of truth.  Yes, some
people have lots of will power &#8212; they're not addicts.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And so what magic do you imagine made you quit drinking and doping?<br>
 Was it confessing your sins to your sponsor?<br>
Was it declaring yourself to be insane?<br>
 Was it begging &quot;Higher Power&quot; to remove your &quot;defects of character&quot;?<br>
Just what is the essential thing that A.A. supplies?<br>
<p>
You haven't even declared that doing the Twelve Steps saved you and made you quit drinking.
Or are you going to declare that the 12 Steps are superfluous, just &quot;suggestions&quot; that you don't
need to follow? Maybe just attending A.A. meetings is what you think the magical cure is?
 
</font>
<p>

I didn't need Bill Wilson or anybody else to tell me that I am an addict
&#8212; that is I fall into addictive behaviors compulsively and obsessively.
I know this deep down in my heart, and I knew this long before I stopped
using.  Now maybe I didn't want to believe it, but that doesn't mean it
wasn't true.  I have no will power over certain things.  That's what
being an addict is. If someone stops on their &quot;own will power&quot; &#8212; well
guess what &#8212; they weren't really an addict now were they?  No they
weren't.

Of course a person can be a real addict and then quit his addiction. People do it every day.
I am just one of many.
In fact, there are so many of us do-it-yourselfers
 that only Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous claim that real addicts can't
quit on their own.
<p>
Doctors know about it, and they write about it.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School says</a>
 that more than half of all alcoholics eventually quit drinking, but only
 about ten percent of them ever get &quot;treatment&quot;.
Harvard says that 80% of the successful quitters do it alone,
 on their own, without any &quot;support group&quot;,
and they do just fine, thank you.
</font>
<p>


  Maybe they were a problem drinker or a binger, etc., but a
true addict doesn't just suddenly stop being addicted to drugs and
alcohol.  It is certainly not that easy.  Sorry to be the one to break

and &quot;wrong&quot; &#8212; so what.  It's the results that count.  I don't give a

yourself, apparently.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Evidence? I've got lots of evidence. Real evidence from real medical doctors who found that

I am always amazed at how people like you hide behind bogus names.  Why

it helps one person, that's a good thing.  But it's not a cult, and
you're right it doesn't work for everybody.  Just like all medications
don't work the same for everybody.  Isn't there room for various
approaches to recovery from addiction?  Of course there is.  You
probably believed the Da Vinci Code was true, I'll bet.

<font color="blue">
A.A. does not help people.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. kills more people than it helps</a>.
And I do care about &quot;how many&quot;.
<p>
And yes,
<a href="orange-cult.html">A.A. is a cult</a>,
and you are proving that right now.
To claim that you don't care about the true facts like how many people A.A. actually helps or hurts
is itself evidence of cultish behavior.
<p>
Lastly, you complain about my pen name? Isn't Alcoholics Anonymous supposed to encourage <i>anonymity</i>?

Our relations with the general public should
be characterized by personal anonymity. We think A.A. ought to
avoid sensational advertising. Our names and pictures as A.A.
members ought not to be broadcast, filmed, or publicly printed.

<p>
So are all of the A.A. members &quot;hiding behind bogus names&quot;?

<p>

But please don't answer.  If you'd like, I'll just admit that you're
right &#8212; I give up, you're the Great Debunker.  Happy?  Now please crawl
back into your destructive little hole.

<p>

Have a day,

<p>
