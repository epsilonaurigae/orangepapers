<h2><li> Idolatry</h2>
<p>
Possibly the greatest heresy in the A.A. dogma is this bit of idolatry:
In the Alcoholics Anonymous program, you can use anything for
your &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot;.

A.A. has lots of stories of people using a bedpan, a teacup, a
doorknob, a stone, a teddy bear, a mountain, a motorcycle, or
<i>&quot;Good Orderly Direction&quot;</i> for their &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
You can pray to any Golden Calf, stone idol, or Higher-Powered item
of Household Hardware that you like.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_group" target="_blank">
You can even use your local A.A. group itself as your 'God'</a>
if you wish.
One of the more ridiculous
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#cult_speak" target="_blank">word redefinitions</a> that A.A.
offers us is, you can
make the word &quot;G.O.D.&quot; mean &quot;<b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>runks&quot;.
<p>
<font color="black"><i>
Another 12-Step organization, Cocaine Anonymous, even twists this into
&quot;G.O.D. = a <b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>rug
addicts&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font>
</i></font>
<br>
So of course, in Narcotics Anonymous, &quot;G.O.D.&quot; can be a Group Of Dopers.

<p>
A.A. founder Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I must quickly assure you that A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest
for faith. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your 'higher power.'
Here's a very large group who have solved their alcohol problem.
In this respect they are certainly a power greater than you, who have not even
come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in them.
Even this minimum of faith will be enough.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 27.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most Christians are more accustomed to the idea of The Father,
The Son, and The Holy Ghost. Not very many of them will
enjoy praying to a group of drunkards, and
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>Seeking and Doing the Will of Drunkards</i></font>.

And I can't imagine Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, or Native Americans
being too happy with such a &quot;Higher Power&quot;, either.
<p>
And &quot;having faith&quot; in a Group Of Drunkards is really stupid.
What am I supposed to believe? That they won't relapse and drink some more?
That they have a special hotline to God and are really expert on spiritual matters?
That I can trust them with my life and my soul?

<p>
In addition, the Twelve Steps talk about &quot;God <i>as we understood Him</i>&quot;.
Members are allegedly free to define God however they imagine or understand
&quot;Him&quot; to be. Bill Wilson told A.A. recruiters to
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or atheist,
make it emphatic that <i>he does not have to agree with your conception of God.</i>
He can choose any conception he likes, provided it makes sense to him.
The main thing is that he be willing to believe in a Power greater than
himself and that he live by spiritual principles.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, Chapter 7,
<i>Working With Others</i>, page 93.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What is that deceptive double-talk?
<ul>
<li>
Atheists, who do not believe in the existence of a God,
don't have to agree with the recruiter's conception of God, but they
must believe in a spiritual &quot;Higher Power&quot;, which, by definition,
atheists don't.
<li>
How could an atheist possibly have a &quot;conception&quot; of a
God Who will deliver miracles on demand when by definition he does
not believe in the existence of any such thing?
<li>
And the atheists certainly won't be willing to believe in what they don't
believe, so Bill's &quot;main thing&quot; isn't going to work for them.
</ul>

<p>
And what about,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He can choose any conception [of God or 'Higher Power' that] he
likes, provided it makes sense to him.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
Oh really?
</font>
<ul>
<li>
What if the prospective recruit is insane &#8212; a wet-brained nutcase who thinks
that worshipping Satan as his Higher Power will solve all of his problems?
Will the A.A. 12-Step program still work for him?
<li>
What if the newcomer is a pagan who wants to worship Wotan, Thor, and
Loki?
<li> What if the prospect is a Neo-Nazi who wants to use Adolf Hitler as his
<i>Higher Power</i>?
</ul>
<p>
Such examples are of course absurd, but so is the statement that you
can use any kind of a &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot; you
want, and that He will nevertheless perform a miracle for you &#8212; save
you from death by alcoholism.

<p>
Bill Wilson emphatically repeated that doctrine in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook
">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Despite the living example of my friend [a sober Ebby Thacher]
there remained in me the vestiges of my old prejudice. The
word God still aroused a certain antipathy. When the thought was
expressed that there might be a God personal to me this feeling
was intensified. I didn't like the idea. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said,
<i>&quot;Why don't you choose your own conception of God?&quot;</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That statement hit me hard. It melted the icy intellectual
mountain in whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years.
I stood in the sunlight at last.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>It was only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power
greater than myself. Nothing more was required of me to make my
beginning.</i> I saw that growth could start from that point.
Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what
I saw in my friend. Would I have it? Of course I would!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus was I convinced that God is concerned with us humans
when we want Him enough. At long last I saw, I felt, I believed.
Scales of pride and prejudice fell from my eyes. A new world
came into view.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>

<p>
That is obviously insane:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It's only necessary that I believe whatever I wish to believe, to get
what I want. My new delusion will care about me.&quot;</i>

By the way, there was
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">no &quot;icy intellectual
mountain&quot; in Bill Wilson's life</a>.
That was just a phony act he put on to make his religious conversion
seem much more miraculous.
All of Bill Wilson's stories about being an intellectual, or an atheist,
or a scientist, were complete fabrications, and totally untrue &#8212;
a complete reversal of reality.
The truth is, Bill Wilson was actually just a superstitious unintellectual
flunk-out who put on airs of having been all kinds of things that he never was,
like a stock broker or a scientist or an intellectual or a holy man.  Or
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#no_infidelity" target="_blank">a faithful husband
who didn't cheat on his wife</a>.

</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Also, Bill's language about &quot;Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what I saw in my friend&quot;
was completely deceptive. Ebby Thacher relapsed all of his life and died a burned-out drunkard, being kept in a drunk
farm for the last years of his life.
You really don't want to build what he had.

The A.A. auxiliary for the other family members,
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Al_Anon" target="_blank">Al-Anon</a>&quot;,
also teaches that we can choose any &quot;God&quot; we want. Al-Anon
propaganda even goes so far as to say that we can hire and fire

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I realized the God of my parents had come in a very small box, not expansive enough for
me. I fired that God and hired a new one. My new Higher Power is much bigger than the old
one. He doesn't live in a box. He lives in me and around me. He loves me, cares for me, and
accepts me just as I am &#8212; a work of art in progress.<br>

<p>
<a name="syncretism"> </a>
But who decides which versions of God are acceptable to an A.A. 12-Step program?
The sponsors? Where did they get their theological training?
What seminary did they attend?
Do theology lessons come packaged in bottles labeled &quot;Jim Beam&quot; and &quot;Jack Daniels&quot;?
<p>
Bill Wilson's goal was ostensibly to be ecumenical,
universal and all-embracing, to avoid religious conflict, but his
solution to the problem was hardly sound theology.
Something that tries to be everything to everybody ends up being
nothing to anybody.
<p>
<blockquote>

It's like reducing religion to a bland pablum that is not offensive to anyone, no matter what their morality
or lack thereof.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="miracles"> </a>
In addition, Bill soon contradicted himself.
Just any old conception of &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot;
will not do at all. The A.A. God cannot be just
any spiritual &quot;Power greater than yourself&quot;.
The Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;God&quot;

be a meddling, micro-managing, order-dictating, prayer-answering,
message-sending, wish-granting, miracle-delivering

deliver miracles on demand, then

<li> You won't get any power over alcohol, and your unmanageable life
won't get managed in Step One, and
<li> you won't get restored to sanity in Step Two, and
<li> God won't take care of your will and your life for you in Step Three, and
<li> your many &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; won't get removed in Step Seven, and
<li> &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot; won't talk to you in

<h2>Joke</h2>

<p>
I went to A.A., and they told me that I could use <i>anything</i>
for my &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
even a doorknob or a bedpan. I decided to have a <i>real</i>
higher-powered &quot;Higher Power&quot;, so
I got on my knees and began praying to Miraculous Microwave.
<p>
All of a sudden, a brilliant light
appeared inside it and blazed out through the holes in the front,
and the oven began smoking,
and a loud deep bass voice inside it growled, &quot;ZOOOOL!&quot;
<p>
Bill Murphy the Ghostbuster walked in and said, &quot;Hmmmm... You don't usually see
such behavior in a major household appliance.&quot;

<h2><li> Any &quot;Higher Power&quot; will restore you to sanity</h2>
<p> 
The idea that you can surrender to <i>any</i> &quot;Higher Power&quot;
and it will be wonderful spirituality is nonsense. What if someone believes
that Satan is the Master of This World, and that evil rules this world?
How will surrendering to Satan and Evil work out?
<p>
Or, what if someone believes that Reverend Sun Myung Moon really is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ?
Or Bagwan Shree Rajneesh is God. Or Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada?
Or Lafayette Ronald Hubbard is the Savior of Mankind?
<p>
Will the A.A. sponsors instruct such a believer in
&quot;the correct beliefs&quot;, and &quot;the correct faith&quot;, or will they
say that the beginner's strange &quot;Higher Power&quot; is really okay, and will produce
great results?
<p>
So, will Satan or Moon or Rajneesh or Prabhupada or Hubbard <i>really</i>
get people sober and deliver miracles on demand and correctly guide people in Step Eleven?
<p>
Remember that A.A. claims that any Higher Power is okay, as long as it makes sense to the newcomer:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or atheist,
make it emphatic that <i>he does not have to agree with your conception of God.</i>

<p>

But what if the newcomer is insane? Lots of them are, you know.  The A.A. Step Two even says:<br>
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>[We] Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b>&quot;
</font><br>
</center>
<p>
So what &quot;Higher Power&quot; is restoring that insane person to sanity?<br>
And how could an insane person choose the correct Higher Power to restore him to sanity before he gets sane?

<p>
Please let me repeat that, it's so important:
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>
How could an insane person choose the correct Higher Power to restore
him to sanity before he gets sane?
</b></font>
<p>
A.A. says that an insane person can wisely chose the correct god to save him.

<h2><li> Selling Your Soul To The Devil</h2>
<p>
The A.A. story about your relationship with God is also rather curious.
The way that Bill Wilson tells the story, you must
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#prayer3" target="_blank">surrender yourself utterly</a>
to your Higher Power (Who is supposed to be God, but Who might be a doorknob or a bedpan,
or a <i>Group Of Drunks</i>, or something else),
and be His slave, and do His bidding every day forever after.
Every day, you must do Step 11, hearing the voice of God to get work orders and
the power to carry out those orders. And then you go do what the voices in your
head tell you to do.
<p>
In return, He will do some magic tricks for you and take away your desire
to drink alcohol, and also grant a few other wishes,
starting with restoring you to &quot;sanity&quot; and taking care of your will
and your life for you, and then removing all of your &quot;defects
of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;.

Maker, <i>as we understood Him</i>: &quot;God, I offer myself to
Thee &#8212; to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy
will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may
bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love,
and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!&quot; We thought
well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that

I can't help but notice that the last time I heard about that
particular bargain, the Higher Power's name was not spelled
&quot;G-O-D&quot;, it was spelled &quot;S-A-T-A-N&quot;
or &quot;D-E-V-I-L&quot;.
You were supposed to sell your soul to the Big Horned Creature with
the cloven feet in a Faustian trade for getting your list of wishes
granted, and then you ended up being a sycophant slave of that
Scaly Creature, doing His Will forever after, and living in
His <i>&quot;new and wonderful world&quot;</i>

<p>
One thing that the preachers told me about that Evil One is that he is
very clever and lies a lot. They say that Old Beelzebub, the Lord of the
Netherworld, isn't above claiming to be, and appearing to be,
God or the Angel of Light or some other Higher Power, while he
bargains with you...

So I can't help but wonder, if you sell your

Speaking of dealing, some of the early A.A. members seem to have thought
that the &quot;spiritual&quot; program was a business deal, too. A.A.
number three, Bill Dotson, is quoted in the <i>Big Book</i> chapter
<i>A Vision For You</i> as saying this to Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">   
&quot;The way you fellows put this spiritual stuff makes sense.
I'm ready to do business. I guess the old folks were right after all.&quot;<br>

It makes sense to me...&quot;</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson repeated the &quot;deal&quot; description of the A.A. program
again while reminiscing about how he wrote the <i>Big Book</i>
and the Twelve Steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this
book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a
six-step program then. <br>
...<br>
The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of
concrete principles
that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out
of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps
which people wiggled out of. <br>

<i>&quot;Yeh, don't you just hate it when they manage to wiggle out of the

and then the damned fool manages to
wiggle out of the contract at the last minute, just because of
some darned nitpicking little legal technicality.
It's really enough to frost your ass, even in Hell.

This is how Bill Wilson described men joining Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many a man, yet dazed from his hospital experience, has stepped over the
threshold of that home into freedom. Many an alcoholic who entered there
came away with an answer.
<font color="#9F0000">He succumbed to that gay crowd inside</font>, who
laughed at their own misfortunes and understood his. Impressed by those
who visited him at the hospital,
<font color="#9F0000">he capitulated entirely</font>
when, later, in an upper room of this house, he heard the story of some
man whose experience closely tallied with his own.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, Chapter 11,
<i>A Vision For You</i>, page 160.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Since when do you &quot;succumb&quot; and &quot;capitulate&quot; to a
cure for a disease?</i> You don't.
What Bill is describing is men surrendering their minds and souls, not men getting cured of a disease.

A.A. resembles Satan-worship much more than it resembles Christianity.
A.A. is like selling your soul to the Devil in trade for sobriety.
You turn your will and your life over to Satan in Step three, in a Faustian
bargain where Satan will make you quit drinking.  And then you must
Seek and Do the Will of Satan every day in Step 11 for the rest of your life, and Satan will
supposedly keep you from drinking.
The Steps inbetween, where you list and confess your sins and wrongs and moral
shortcomings, and list all of the people whom you have offended,
entertain Satan and give Him many good laughs, and also make
you believe that you really are low and evil and unworthy.
And then you promise to lure newcomers in, and get more followers for Satan,
by hiding the truth and not discussing any theological issues:
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Don't raise such issues, no matter what your own convictions are.&quot;</i>
</font>
And you tell the newcomers that they can have <i>anything</i> as their &quot;god&quot;,
it's all okay. And you jabber
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;We are not saints&quot;</i>
</font>
as an excuse for any and all misbehavior.
<p>
Honestly, did Jesus Christ teach his followers that they should hide the
truth from the newcomers, to lure them in, and only reveal the real
nature of the church later? Did Jesus say,
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Don't tell the prospects about the God stuff. Save that for later,
after we have lured them in. There will be plenty of time to reveal the
'spiritual' nature of our fellowship later on.

My schoolmate

deficiencies. We made a list of people whom I had hurt or toward whom
I felt resentment.<br>

relationship with my Creator; that I would have the elements of a way of
living which answered all my problems. &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>

Steps One, Two and Three opened doors to profound and meaningful changes.
The effects of being raised in an alcoholic family seemed as fixed in me as my eye color.
Two traits come to mind &#8212; turning to emotionally unavailable people for support,
and engaging in self-doubt and self-hate. With the help of my sponsor,
I now see that these and other traits, not other people, are the source of my
anguish.<br>

That insight, however, was only the beginning.

Isn't it rather odd how that authoress claims that it doesn't matter who or what your

&quot;Don't bother your pretty little head with worrying about precisely

</i></font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Also notice the broken logic:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Why? Because of Step Two. A Power greater than myself can help me.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
That is just so much bull droppings.
Step Two does not say that a &quot;Higher Power&quot; <i>CAN</i> help you and <i>WILL</i> help you.
Step Two says:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>2. [We] Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</b>
</font>

<p>
Just because you
<font color="#9F0000"><b><i>believe</i></b></font>
that some unnamed ghost or demon or miscellaneous &quot;Higher Power&quot; spirit
<font color="#9F0000"><b><i>could</i></b></font> make you sane doesn't guarantee
that he really <font color="#9F0000"><b><i>can</i></b></font>
do it and that he <font color="#9F0000"><b><i>actually will</i></b></font> do it.
The authoress pulled a quick switch there, and substituted her own beliefs and
wishful thinking for facts.
She also switched the declared action of Step Two from &quot;restore us to sanity&quot;
to &quot;help me&quot;.

<p>
Besides, Step Two is just a crazy piece of heretical nonsense

<a name="demand_miracle"> </a>
<a name="miracles_on_demand"> </a>
<h2><li> Miracles On Demand</h2>
<p>
One of the biggest heresies in the Twelve Steps is the
demand for a miracle in Step Seven:
<p>
<center>
<font size="+2" color="#4f007f">
[We] &quot;Humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;
</font>
</center>
<p>
No matter how humbly we ask for it, and no
matter whether we do it on our knees,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#knees" target="_blank">like the original version
of Step Seven said</a>,
it is still a
<b><i>demand</i></b> for a miracle, not just a polite request. We have
made absolutely no preparations for taking care of ourselves
and solving our own problems ourselves should
God decide not to grant us that miracle.
There is no Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;Plan B.&quot;

<p>
Bill Wilson became even more demanding in his so-called
&quot;Seventh Step Prayer&quot; &#8212; Bill wanted <i>every defect
removed</i>, and he wanted strength too,
and Bill didn't even say please or thank you:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When ready, we say something like this,
&quot;My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad.
I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character
which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows.
Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding. Amen.&quot;
We have then completed <i>Step Seven</i>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, page 76.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, Bill might have been done with Step 7, but was God done?
Is God going to grant Bill's demands and make Bill into a strong, defect-free slave?

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Also notice how Bill Wilson actually tried to con God &#8212; Bill argued that
God should remove all of Bill's defects so that Bill would
be a more useful slave for God.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
God has to do it, or He will blow the whole 12-Step program.
Step Seven is the heart of the entire A.A. self-improvement
routine: You just wait for God to fix you. Literally. The rest of the
steps involve making lists of all of your faults, wrongs, sins, defects
of character, and moral shortcomings, and
making more lists of all of the people you have harmed, and making
amends, and wallowing in guilt, confessing your sins,
and admitting that you are powerless and insane,
but no other step actually deals with fixing yourself.

<p>
What if God says,
<font color="blue">
&quot;No. You made your bed, now you lie in it...&quot;?<br>
&quot;Besides, what have you done for Me lately? Go fix yourself.&quot;
</font>
<p>
If God doesn't fix you, then you are screwed.
<p>
If God won't fulfill Bill Wilson's demands, and work Bill's Steps like Bill Wilson says,
then your goose is cooked and you are in trouble.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>'But let's not think about that.
Let's all just &quot;come to believe&quot; that God will fix us
and make us quit drinking just because we humbly &quot;pray&quot; that He do it.'</i>
</font>

<p>
And He will, Bill Wilson says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor.<br>
...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it.<br>
...<br>
We have not even sworn off.  Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Bill Wilson, recovery from alcoholism is effortless.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It just comes.&quot;</i></font>
We don't have to do a thing. Our problems are magically solved
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;without any thought or effort on our part.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
That is obviously
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">completely delusional nonsense</a>.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>(No effort? Don't we have to go to a life-long series of A.A. meetings,
and <i>&quot;Work The Steps&quot;</i> constantly,
and &quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#vision_of_God" target="_blank">Seek And Do
God's Will</a>&quot; every day?  That's a lot of effort.)</i>
</font>

<p>
Remember,
<ul>
<li>
we declared in Step One that we were powerless over alcohol,
<li>
and in Step Two, we declared that we were insane,
<li>
and in Step Three we gave away our wills,
<li>
so in Step Seven we demand a miracle &#8212;
we demand that God actually change us,
and take away the desire to drink,
or else we will drink ourselves to death.
</ul>
<p>
That is very much like this temptation of Christ in Matthew 4.5:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then the Devil took Jesus to Jerusalem, the Holy City,
set him on the highest point of the Temple, and said to him,
&quot;If you are God's Son, throw yourself down, for the
scripture says,<br>

You do not throw yourself off of a precipice, demanding that God save
you before you hit bottom and go &quot;splat!&quot;,
and you don't demand that God keep you
from drinking, or else you will kill yourself on booze.
<p>
<a name="Wiley_1"> </a>
But the pro-A.A. literature still insists that we should do that.
We find something
very similar passed off as a wonderful &quot;leap of faith&quot; in the
book <i>Power Recovery, The Twelve Steps for a New Generation</i>,
by James Wiley:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font size="+1"><i>A Leap of Faith</i><br>
</font>
&quot;I heard a noise in the kitchen, and turned to see my two-year-old
son on top of the kitchen counter, teetering at the edge,&quot;
said Mike G. &quot;My heart almost stopped. 'Daddy!' he called,
and stretched out his arms and leaped into space. I lunged forward
and caught him in my arms. Later I thought: 'He had no fear of
falling. He never doubted for an instant that I would catch him.
How wonderful!' I thought, 'A true leap of faith. If only I could make
such a leap of faith to my God.'&quot;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
You, like Mike's little boy, may have the courage to go ahead and
make that leap of faith. But even if you still have doubts, go
ahead and risk it. &quot;If you don't believe it, do it anyway,&quot;
said Bill T.<br>

New Generation</i>, by James Wiley, page 46.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What insidious nonsense.
The Bible just specifically told us not to play games like that.
<p>
Worse yet, according to the standard A.A. dogma, we can have any
God or home-made &quot;god&quot;
we wish. Our &quot;Higher Power&quot; can be any
&quot;Power greater than ourselves&quot;,
or any &quot;God as we understood Him&quot;.
Our new god can even be a bedpan or a doorknob or a Golden Calf or a stone idol or our new
 &quot;G.O.D.&quot; that is a &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;.
<p>
Then, according to Mr. Wiley, we are supposed to
faithfully believe that our personal made-up version of God is totally real and correct
and all-powerful and able to deliver miracles,
and we are supposed to believe it so fervently that we will
make a &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; and jump off of a
spiritual cliff, betting our lives and our souls that our home-made
god will catch us before we hit bottom and die.</i>
<p>
And then they pass off that suicidally stupid behavior as wonderful &quot;faith&quot;.
Faith in what?
<ul>
<li> Faith in our own imagination?
<li> Faith in our superstitions?
<li> Faith in a Golden Calf or a doorknob?
<li> Faith in our own delusions of grandeur? (<font color="#9F0000">&quot;I'm so great that I can create a god.&quot;</font>)
</ul>
<p>
How is any of that compatible with the teachings of Jesus Christ?
(Or compatible with the teachings of Mohammed, or Buddha, or Seneca, or
Confucius, or Soloman or Moses?)

<a name="miracle_demands"> </a>
<br>
Speaking of demanding miracles, if we get nit-picking
about it, six of the twelve steps actually
demand miracles from God:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Step One says that we are powerless over alcohol, so God
must control our drinking for us, or else we will die. And Step One also
says that our lives are unmanageable (meaning: we cannot manage our own lives),
so by implication,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane" target="_blank">God must manage our lives for us</a>.
<li> Step Two says that we are insane, and that only God can
restore us to sanity, so we are demanding that God do that for us, too.
<li> Step Three says that we are turning our wills and our lives
over to the care of God, so God has to work for us and take care
of us from then on, or it blows the whole 12-Step game.
<li> Step Seven demands that God remove all of our &quot;defects of
character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;. And Bill Wilson
also wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">
God will also remove our desire for drink</a> &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;That is the miracle of it. &nbsp; ...
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.&quot;</i>
</font>
<!----------
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.)</font>
------------------>
<li> Then, in Step Eleven, we pray for God to make us understand
Him better, and to give us our work orders for the day, and then to give
us the power to carry out those orders.
One of the fundamental beliefs of both Buchmanism and A.A. is that God
will reveal himself to us if we truly seek Him, so He had better do it.
<li> And finally, in Step Twelve God is supposed to give us a
&quot;spiritual experience&quot; or a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;
as our reward for having done the preceding eleven steps.
</ul>
<p>
And should God refuse to do any of those tasks for us,
then it ruins the whole Twelve-Step program.
If God won't play along, and <i>Work The Steps</i> for us, and do what we wish,
then how can the Twelve-Step program possibly work?
<p>
The simple undeniable answer is,
<center>
<font color="#9F0000">
<h3><i><b>&quot;It can't.&quot;</b></i></font></h3>
</center>
<p>
The whole Alcoholics Anonymous
program depends on God micro-managing both our lives and the world
around us, and granting our wishes and
making everything turn out okay just the way that Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson
said that He would
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">if we followed their instructions</a>.
<p>
And we are supposed to believe that we are incapable of doing any of that stuff for
ourselves, and God must do <i>all of it</i> for us. We are supposed to believe
that we are completely powerless, helpless, insane, and unable to manage our own lives, and
that only by having God make good little robots or puppets out of us can we live good lives. 
<p>
The A.A. slogan is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I pray to God every day that I never get the idea that I can
run my own life.&quot;<br>
</font>

And the other slogan is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let Go and Let God.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<center><table border="6" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" width="99%">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

It's interesting to see how cleverly both Buchmanism and
Alcoholics Anonymous hide their demanding nature.
The A.A. true believer will insist that he doesn't make demands of
God, that in fact he does just the opposite &#8212; that he devotes his
whole life seeking and doing the will of God.
He says that he wants to be a perfect servant of God.
But the entire A.A. program makes constant demands of God, interrupted
only by Step Eleven's offer to do some work for God in return.
The A.A. program is entirely based on the superstitious idea that God
will become our servant and take care of us and give us what we want:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have no other explanation for the many good things that have
happened to me since I have been in A.A. &#8212; they came to me
from a Greater Power.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
<i>Rum, Radio, and Rebellion</i>, page 367.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That reminds me of
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#blasphemy" target="_blank">a criticism of Frank Buchman's doctrines</a>
before World War II:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I count it blasphemy for Dr. Buchman, or anybody else, to pretend to
testify to what God has done for him while humanity is at this moment
perishing.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Rev. John Haynes Holmes, quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>, July 16, 1934, page 9.
</font>
</blockquote>
</font></td></tr></table></center>


<p><br>
In fact, A.A. has it exactly backwards: Many Christian
believers will do something like give
up drinking alcohol for Lent. They do not say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God: you
must take away my desire to drink or
else I will drink myself into a stupor every night of Lent.&quot;
</font>
No, they say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;I can control my
actions. I will voluntarily give up the pleasure of drinking
alcohol for Lent, to show my devotion to God.&quot;
</font>

<p>
And to say that ordinary people can control their drinking,
and give it up for Lent, but
alcoholics cannot, is baloney, and a cop-out. It is just
<i>spiritual laziness</i>, demanding that
God fix what the alcoholic could fix by himself.

And the
alcoholics most assuredly can fix their
problems themselves &#8212; there are millions of them doing it,
including me, and doing it without the
insanity of the A.A. Twelve Steps.
<font color="blue">
(Admittedly, it's hard. Nobody said it would be easy. But there is
an infinite difference between &quot;hard&quot; and
&quot;impossible.&quot;)
</font>
In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific" target="_blank">more people recover
from alcoholism without A.A. and the Twelve Steps than do it with them</a>,
several times over.

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#NIAAA_NES" target="_blank">The National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health reported</a>
that 75% of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do
so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab)
programs and AA.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard
Medical School says</a> that 80% of the people who successfully
quit drinking for a year or more do it <i>alone</i>,
without <b><i>any</i></b> therapy program or support group.
A.A. won't tell you that; that's one of the biggest dirty little
secrets that A.A. has &#8212; that A.A. is actually unnecessary.
A.A. dogma says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Nobody can do it alone.&quot;
</font>
The truth is, the vast majority of the people who recover do it that way.

<p>
<a name="Geo_Bush"> </a>
As a matter of fact, the former President of the United States,
George W. Bush, says that he just quit drinking
when the consequences of heavy drinking and doping got to be too much. He
says he didn't use A.A.. And this time, I believe him. Guess where
George B. would be today, if he had had a sponsor who said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;George,
don't let anything get in front of your recovery. Just keep coming to
the meetings, and doing The Steps, and don't let some outside interest
like politics interfere with your recovery.&quot;
</font>
He'd still be sitting in a church basement in Texas, talking to the
walls about how unhappy he is.
<p>
Question: Shouldn't the A.A. faithful be calling
George W. Bush a &quot;dry drunk&quot;?
He quit drinking without doing the Twelve Steps, and that is
the A.A. formula for becoming a bitterly unhappy
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#dry_drunk" target="_blank">dry drunk</a> who
is a seething cauldron of anger, resentments, and uncontrolled
aggressiveness.
So what do the A.A. enthusiasts have to say about that?

<a name="Pharisees"> </a>
<br>
The Bible has more to say about miracles on demand: Matthew 12.38:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then some teachers of the law and some Pharisees spoke up.
&quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;we want to see you perform
a miracle.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;How evil and godless are the people of this day!&quot;
Jesus exclaimed. &quot;You ask me for a miracle? No!&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Matthew 16:1 says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Pharisees and Sadducees came and, to test him, asked him to show them a sign
from heaven. He said to them in reply, &quot;In the evening you say, 'Tomorrow will be
fair, for the sky is red'; and, in the morning, 'Today will be stormy,
for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to judge the appearance
of the sky, but you cannot judge the signs of the times. An evil and unfaithful
generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of
Jonah.&quot; Then he left them and went away.<br>

Jesus just didn't like people demanding miracles and signs, did he?

I have to comment:<br>
Yes, God can do anything.<br>
But where, true believers,
does it say that <b><i>God will do anything for you</i></b>?<br>
<font color="blue">
<b>When did God become <i>your</i> slave?</b><br>
When did God become like Aladdin's Genie
who has to grant you three wishes when you rub his lamp?<br>
</font>
<p>

Countless millions of other people on this planet are suffering and
dying from all kinds of things, particularly starvation and diseases,
and God won't do just any old special favor for them.
God lets them die. Sixty thousand people die of starvation every day
on this planet, and most of them are children.
That's just how it is.
Millions of people are dying of AIDS in Africa.
It's beyond being an epidemic &#8212; entire regions of Africa
are being depopulated.
Those people are far too poor to be able to afford drugs like AZT;
their entire countries are too poor; it's totally out of the question;
so they die without medicines.
And God just lets them die, in spite of their prayers.
<p>
But somehow, you 12-Steppers think that you are so special that
you rate God's favors when they don't?
What makes you think you are so special?
<ul>
<li> Drinking and drugging too much?
<li> Brain damage?
<li> Having white skin?
<li> Imagining that only you and your group are doing the Will of God,
and everyone else in the world isn't?
</ul>
<font color="green">
Inquiring minds want to know.
</font>

<p>
And mind you, that is not a criticism of God. It is a criticism of
the stupidity of people.
In the rather hokey movie <i>Oh God!</i> where George Burns played God,
he had at least one great line, in which God said simply,
<font color="blue">
<b>&quot;I don't do cheap magic tricks.&quot;</b>
</font>
<p>
That one simple line answers so much. Isn't it enough that the Lord created
the entire physical Universe in a blindingly brilliant flash of light?
Must the Lord also hang around this backwater planet and do cheap
magic tricks to amuse the local yokels?
<p>
If you can accept the idea that the Lord simply does not do cheap
magic tricks, then you can accept the idea that God doesn't play
Santa Claus, and God doesn't deliver miracles on demand. You can
understand how
<ul>
<li> the Lord did not rescue Job in the Old Testament of the Bible,
<li> and God did not save the Jews in Auschwitz, and
<li> God did not even save Jesus when he was crucified.
<li> God did not save the starving children in Bangladesh or Biafra or Ethiopia, and
<li> God did not save the World Trade Center, and
<li> God will not save the Africans with AIDS.
</ul>
That's a tough one to accept, but that's just the way it is.

<p>
But if you do come to terms with that idea, the idea that God is
not Santa Claus and does not grant wishes like a Genie who just
popped out of a bottle, then it really blows a big hole in the
theology of Alcoholics Anonymous. All of the people
in meetings yammering about how their &quot;Higher Power&quot; is giving them
a bunch of wonderful things becomes ludicrous. All of this talk about
getting the goodies becomes childish nonsense and wishful thinking:
<font color="#4f007f">

People who imagine that God will grant all of their wishes and solve all of their

There, Jesus prayed and asked, <i>TWICE</i>, to be spared from the agony of death by crucifixion.
The answer was &quot;No.&quot; God did not grant that wish.

Nevertheless, the A.A. true believers imagine that they will get all of

And those of us who try to be sane and reasonable in our religious beliefs
get really tired of the moronic, superstitious, childish
<i>Santa Claus spirituality</i> of the
the A.A. true believers who think that they can get whatever
they want just by praying for it &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Just incant the name of your favorite Higher Power three times, loudly,
and then read your Christmas wish list out loud, and Santa Claus will soon bring you
all of the goodies.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
And lest you have any doubts, Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Step Eleven suggests prayer and meditation. We shouldn't be shy on this
matter of prayer. Better men than we are using it constantly.
It works, if we have the proper attitude and work at it.<br>
<font size="-1" face="Times">The <i>Big Book</i>, pages 85-86.</font>
<p>
It works &#8212; it really does.<br>
<font size="-1" face="Times">The <i>Big Book</i>, page 88.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson wrote on page 87,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are careful never to pray for our own selfish ends&quot;</font>,
but the giddy believers who are getting the goodies ignore that,
and happily brag at meetings about all of the wonderful stuff that
God has given them lately, like this...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have no other explanation for the many good things that have
happened to me since I have been in A.A. &#8212; they came to me

<font color="blue">
(Those good things couldn't have been caused by quitting drinking?
They couldn't have been caused by no longer constantly shooting yourself
in the foot by always being drunk at the wrong times?
They couldn't possibly have been caused by being clear-headed, healthy,
and able to work and get stuff done &#8212; just for a change?)

<p>
And then the enthusiastic believers pray for even more goodies, as if
God is their Divine Butler, on call day and night, always eager to solve all
of their problems for them.

Unbelievable as it may seem, some 12-Step pundits see no problem
with the Santa-Claus praying. The following religious advice comes
from the sages of Al-Anon, in their official publication:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Many times at our own, as well as at AA meetings, I have heard
people talk of &quot;gimme prayers&quot; as if they were worthless.
Speaking only for myself, I believe they could not be more wrong
because I cannot think God considers any prayer worthless.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Just as most children creep before they walk, and walk
before they run, so we progress spiritually from &quot;gimme&quot;
prayers to selfless ones where we ask only to know God's Will
and to follow it. No one says the child is wasting his time creeping
&#8212; he's just learning, just as we have to learn to pray.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Furthermore, I cannot see that it is wrong to ask for material
help, when the Lord's Prayer itself contains our plea for daily
bread. I believe we get beyond the point of asking for purely
material things just as some of our members are able to
<font color="blue">
thank God for their having married an alcoholic and thus learning about
our program.</font><br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Al-Anon's favorite forum editorials</i>, pages 63-64.</font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Al-Anon actually says that Al-Anon is so wonderful that it was worth
it to marry an alcoholic and go through Hell just so that you would
be forced to join Bill Wilson's version of Frank Buchman's fascist
cult religion.
You should be grateful to alcohol for having messed up your family's lives.<br>
<p>

<a name="narcissistic"> </a>
<li> And greedily praying for all of the things on your wish list is
just good practice in praying, they say.
You are allegedly just getting used to praying, and learning
to be a passive dependent and learning to expect some
<i>&quot;Higher Power&quot;</i> to give you everything you want...<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
That is some grossly heretical superstitious nonsense, of course.
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is totally
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic</a>
for someone to expect Big Daddy, <i>Big God</i>, or <i>&quot;Higher Power&quot;</i>
to take care of
her and grant all of her wishes, as if she were a little child and
God was the stern but loving parent who will bring gifts to His child
when she is good.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
As Dr. Charlotte Kasl pointed out in
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Kasl" target="_blank">her book</a>,
<i>Many Roads, One Journey: Moving Beyond the 12 Steps</i>,
that is a descent into infantile narcissism, where people regress to being helpless
(&quot;powerless&quot;) babies who lay in their beds and wait for their
all-powerful (&quot;Higher Power&quot;) Mommies and Daddies to grant
all of their wishes and satisfy their every demand just because they cry.<br>

<li>
It is an attempt to return to infancy, where the baby
lays helplessly on his backside and waits for Big Mommy and Big Daddy
to satisfy all of his desires (and screams if they are slow about it).
</ul>

<p>
Time to grow up and learn to stand on your own two feet, and not
expect Santa Clause to bring the goodies.

<p>
<li>
And Al-Anon says:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God never considers any prayer to be worthless.&quot;</font>

I find it amusing that the Hazelden Foundation 12-step religious propaganda says that
Al-Anon is all wrong and is practicing black magic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The wrong kinds of prayer can be a form of black magic, for when we seek to use
a supernatural force to help us achieve our goals, it ceases to be
supernatural and becomes superhuman. To make God into a servant
is to place him under our superhuman power. Yet is this not exactly
what we have long been taught to do? To get down on our knees and
pray for God to go to work for us?<br>

<h2><li> Pretentions of Faith Healing</h2>
<p>
Many newcomers to A.A. find the oldtimers instructing them to
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">stop taking their
doctor-prescribed medications</a> and just trust the 12 Steps to heal them, no matter
what their aliment is.
That is faith healing, pure and simple, just as insane as those Christian cults that
don't believe in going to doctors for medical care when they are sick, even deathly ill.
A.A. has caused many deaths by telling sick people not to take their doctor-prescribed medications.

<p>
A.A. and the other 12-Step organizations, especially Al-Anon, jabber slogans like,
<ul>
<li> &quot;Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
<li> &quot;You won't have 'real sobriety' if you take medications.&quot;</a>
<li> &quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#God_anything" target="_blank">God can do anything</a>.
You don't need medications.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you take medications to treat an addiction,
<a href="orange-big_lie.html#substituting" target="_blank">you are just substituting one drug for another</a>.&quot;
<li> &quot;Medications just treat the surface symptoms. The Twelve Steps will get
at the underlying causes.&quot;
<li> &quot;Doctors who prescribe drugs don't know anything about
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">using spirituality to cure spiritual diseases</a>.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no chemical solution to a spiritual problem.&quot;
<li>
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#substituting" target="_blank">
 &quot;A word of caution: The use of other mood-altering medications, like
tranquilizers, can be very dangerous to a recovering addict and only
a band-aid on the real problem for a non-addict.&quot;</a>

</ul>

<p>
A.A. members who insist that the 12 Steps will heal any disease are actually attributing
magical powers to the 12 Steps. Those Steps have no such powers.
The 12 Steps are Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion practices for recruiting and converting
newcomers. They have no healing powers. Attempting to use the 12 Steps to do magical
healings is essentially an attempt at practicing black magic.

<p>
A.A. also arrogates unto itself healing powers like those of Jesus Christ. But nowhere in
the Bible does it say that if you practice the 12 Steps, you will get healing powers.
And demanding that God heal people just because they are A.A. members doing the 12 Steps
is another example of the A.A. heresy:
&quot;<a href="#miracles_on_demand" target="_blank">Miracles On Demand</a>&quot;.

<p>
Here is a long list of 
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">A.A. &quot;No Meds&quot; Horror Stories</a>,
where the A.A. &quot;no medications&quot; doctrine produced very bad results.

<h2><li> Occult Practices</h2>
<p>

Many churches will object to the occult practices inherent in Alcoholics
Anonymous.
<p>
Essentially, Step Eleven demands that the A.A. follower &quot;channel&quot;
God. (Yes, channelling, just like Shirley MacLaine taught.)
The A.A. member is supposed to just sit quietly, and pray and meditate until 
he hears God talking to him.
Then he assumes that his own internal mental noise,
the voices in his head, are <b><i>The Voice of God</i></b>,
talking to him and giving him religious instruction and marching orders:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Note the contradiction here: The standard A.A. dogma says that you
can use anything you wish for your Higher Power &#8212; a doorknob, a
teddy bear, a bedpan, a motorcycle, or
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_group" target="_blank">your A.A. group</a>
{G.O.D. == &quot;a <b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>runks&quot;}.
But when you practice Step Eleven, and pray to
<i>Doorknob Almighty</i> or <i>Baal Bedpan</i>,
<i>&quot;God&quot;</i> answers back... Hmmm....)

Bill Wilson learned this particular technique from

whose Oxford Groups would sit silently during the

listen for God to give them messages.

So, if we practice the Twelve Steps enough, we will supposedly end up in a

and telling us what to do, all day long.

We may get into trouble by doing all kinds of absurd things and
believing all kinds of absurd ideas

<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance_criticisms" target="_blank">The same criticisms</a>
of the doctrine of <i>Guidance</i> that theologians and clergy
leveled at Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups apply to Alcoholics Anonymous:
<ul>
<li> The person who is under <i>Guidance</i> discards his
rational thinking mind and just
follows impulses that he receives from he knows not where.
He abandons intelligent planning of his life in favor of following
sudden impulses that just come from somewhere &#8212; hopefully, but not
necessarily, from a good source.
His life often becomes erratic and impulsive, following now this moment's
<i>Guidance</i>, and now that,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#break_appointments" target="_blank">breaking appointments and commitments on
a whim</a>.
<p>
<li> And of course, there is the unavoidable question of &quot;What is the real
source of this <i>'Guidance'</i>? &#8212; God? The subconscious mind?
Or one's favorite demon?&quot;
<p>
<li> There is simply no Biblical support for this psychic practice.
<p>
<li> Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham,
said in his criticism of the Oxford Groups:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Groupism discloses in its conception of 'Guidance' precisely the same error
as that which infects its conception of 'witness'.
<font color="#9F0000">It 'seeks a sign'.</font>
It insists on something precise, concrete, calculable.
Its temper of mind is rather Pharisaic than Christian. It seeks proofs
of Divine action in what is abnormal, amazing, even miraculous.
Its view of inspiration is mechanical, and its treatment of Scripture
literalist. Thus it comes about that, even in the process of exalting
the genuinely Christian conception of the 'guided life', it perverts
and lowers it.<br>

for reason and common sense or for principles and conscience.
No suggestion is ever made that we should substitute 'guidance' for our

In other words, that in man which he shares with other

If you really &quot;have faith&quot; and truly believe that God is guiding you
in your every activity and inserting thoughts into your head all day long,
then you should have no problem with making another &quot;leap of faith&quot;
and walking across freeways blindfolded, trusting that the Lord will tell you
when to go and where to place your feet...
If the Lord is capable of giving you infallible <i>Guidance</i> in all
important matters, then surely the Lord can be trusted to tell you how
to safely cross busy highways and freeways.

<p>
In Buchmanism, the best of the human mind is thrown into the trash can,
while the lower centers of the animal brain are retained.
Rational thought and intelligent thinking &#8212; the best of what separates us from the
lower animals &#8212; are distrusted and discarded,
while the optical centers, which even toads and snakes have, are still trusted to
do their jobs properly. If anything, Frank Buchman got it all backwards.
Carried to its logical conclusion, Buchmanism would reduce us to being dumb, stupid,
unthinking animals who just mindlessly obey orders, or into brainless robots that are
under external control.

<p>
The Buchmanite practice of constantly seeking <i>Guidance</i> for every decision
reminds me of those people who, in the nineteen-sixties, became obsessed with the
<i>I Ching</i>, and used it to make every decision in their lives.
<p>
One consults the <i>I Ching</i> by drawing straws or throwing coins, the
outcome of which determines which pages of the book one should read to get guidance,
advice, and vague, suggestive platitudes (<i>&quot;Perseverence furthers&quot;</i>).
<p>
Some people who are knowledgeable
about the <i>I Ching</i> say that you are not supposed to consult it more than
a few times in your life &#8212; that it was never intended to be a daily guide in
all matters.
<p>
It is easy to see that someone who uses the <i>I Ching</i> and the random outcome
of coin tosses to determine his whole life is misguided and obsessed with the occult.
What is less obvious is that someone
who uses <i>mainstream</i> religions (even Christianity and the Bible)
in the same manner is making the same error.
<p>
Frank Buchman's <i>Guidance</i> and Bill Wilson's <i>Eleventh Step</i>
are also undoubtedly that same error.

When God wasn't talkative enough, the A.A. founders Bill Wilson
and Dr. Robert Smith turned to
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Ouija" target="_blank">the Ouija board</a>
to get more messages from the spirits.
The official A.A. biography of Bill Wilson and history of
Alcoholics Anonymous, <i>PASS IT ON</i>, tells us, on pages 275 to 280,
how both Bill and Bob pursued their interest in spiritism during the 1940's.
They believed that it demonstrated the existence of the
&quot;Higher Power&quot; so central to their A.A. program.
<p>
<i>PASS IT ON</i> says:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;One of Bill's persistent fascinations and involvements
was with psychic phenomena.&quot;
</font>
It speaks of his
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;belief in clairvoyance
and other extrasensory manifestations&quot;
</font>
and his belief in his own psychic ability.
<font size="-1">(Page 275.)</font>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;This was not a mere pastime. It was a passion directly
related to AA which went on for many years.&quot;

<font size="-1">(Page 280.)</font>

Likewise, Susan Cheever reported,

time &quot;spooking,&quot; invoking the spirits of the

Thus, shortly after the Wilsons moved into their Bedford Hills
home, Bill and friends began to hold regular &quot;spook sessions&quot;,
complete
with mysterious messages on a Ouija board, spirit rapping, and channelling
of spirits. Bill Wilson even set aside
one downstairs room as the &quot;spook room&quot; where the s&eacute;ances
were held. (It is still there. You can go visit the house
<i>&quot;Stepping Stones&quot;</i> and see the spook room,
downstairs to the left, complete with book shelves loaded with
occult books.)
<p>

UPDATE: Feb. 2012: Alas, the latest news is that the managers of Stepping Stones
refurbished and refurnished the room, and got rid of all evidence of spooking.

Bill Wilson fancied himself an &quot;adept&quot;, &quot;gifted&quot;
in the psychic sense, and he served as a medium for a variety of
discarnate entities who chose
to speak through him in s&eacute;ances and &quot;spook sessions.&quot;
One account published in the official A.A. history book,
<i>PASS IT ON</i>,
tells of a pre-breakfast conversation that Bill had with a trio
of ghosts
&#8212; whom Bill Wilson claimed were three distinct long-dead Nantucket
citizens &#8212; during a trip to Nantucket in 1944.
<font size="-1">(Pages 276-278.)</font>
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Actually, that conversation with the old ghosts of Nantucket
looks suspiciously like
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Nantucket" target="_blank">a faked psychic stunt</a>.)
</font>

<p>
Henrietta Seiberling wrote that
Wilson also practiced
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#auto_writing" target="_blank">automatic
writing</a>, which is supposed to be a way of receiving the
thoughts of a dead person.
How it works is, you relax and clear your mind, and then just write down
whatever comes into your head. Then you imagine that your writings are
messages from departed people or other spirits.
Bill imagined that he wrote dictation from a Catholic priest who
had lived in the 1600 period in Barcelona, Spain.
<p>
In the official A.A. history book <i>'PASS IT ON'</i>, Bill Wilson described the
&quot;spook sessions&quot; this way:

<a name="evil_spirits"> </a>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The ouija board got moving in earnest. What followed was the fairly usual
experience &#8212; it was a strange m&eacute;lange of Aristotle, St. Francis, diverse
archangels with odd names, deceased friends &#8212; some in purgatory and others doing
nicely, thank you! There were malign and mischievous ones of all descriptions,
telling of vices quite beyond my ken, even as former alcoholics. Then, the seemingly
virtuous entities would elbow them out with messages of comfort, information,
advice &#8212; and sometimes just sheer nonsense.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill would lie on the couch in the living room, semi-withdrawn, but not in a trance,
and &quot;receive&quot; messages, sometimes a word at a time, sometimes a letter at
a time. Anne B., neighbor and &quot;spook&quot; circle regular, would write the
material on a pad. Lois describes one of the more dramatic of these sessions:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Bill would lie down on the couch. He would 'get' these things. He kept doing
it every week or so. Each time, certain people would 'come in.' Sometimes, it would
be new ones, and they'd carry on some story. There would be long sentences; word
by word would come through. This time, instead of word by word, it was letter by
letter. Anne put them down letter by letter.&quot;<br>

Bill Wilson declared that the A.A. involvement with the occult was extensive and commonplace,
not a rare or exceptional thing. In a lengthy letter to Rev. Sam Shoemaker in 1958, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>

Throughout A.A., we find a large amount of psychic phenomena, nearly all
of it spontaneous. Alcoholic after alcoholic tells me of such experiences

Bill enthusiastically wrote to his Catholic Priest friend,
Father Ed Dowling, telling about the help and guidance he was
receiving from spirits of the dead while writing his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and
Twelve Traditions</i> (July 17, 1952):

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...Bill adds,
&quot;But I have good help &#8212; of that I am certain. Both over here and over there.&quot;
The &quot;over there&quot; refers to the spirit world. Bill slipped in this voice
from the other side like this was an everyday happening. It was, he said, the voice
of Boniface, an apostle from England to Germany, Bavaria, and France, who reformed
old church structures, and as bishop with powers from Rome, set up new monasteries
and bishoprics. Amazing, that Bill with hangups on the hierarchical church was
open to receiving help from a dead bishop.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Sanserif,Courier">
One turned up the other day calling himself Boniface. Said he was a
Benedictine missionary and English. Had been a man of learning, knew
missionary work and a lot about structures. I think he said this all
the more modestly but that was the gist of it. I'd never heard of
this gentleman but he checked out pretty well in the Encyclopedia. If
this one is who he says he is &#8212; and of course there is no certain way
of knowing &#8212; would this be licit contact in your book?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
He checked with Dowling to discern the spirit. Bill ended this letter by saying
that he is &quot;coming back to earth&quot; (from Boniface) and that Harper was
interested in publishing the book.<font size="-1"><sup>106</sup></font><br>

The reason that <i>&quot;their exact names checked out&quot;</i>
was probably because
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Nantucket" target="_blank">it was a faked psychic stunt</a>.
<p>
And so was the stunt with Boniface.
<p>
All that Bill Wilson had to do was go to either the public
library in New York City or the library at Columbia University, and find
an old manuscript or book of the sermons of Boniface,
and memorize a few paragraphs from it (in Latin), and then
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spook_sessions" target="_blank">recite them during a s&eacute;ance</a>.
He recited them letter by letter, so he didn't even have to get the pronunciation correct.

<p>
And how was the message verified as coming from Boniface? By a scholar or minister looking it up
and finding it in an old book about Boniface.
<p>
<i>
And if you think about it for a while, you have to wonder:
&quot;If it were really the spirit of Boniface, why would Boniface waste a precious opportunity
to communicate with humanity by just repeating one of his old sermons that had
already been written down and printed in a book? Why wouldn't Boniface send a new message,
something that he had learned from five centuries of dwelling in Heaven?&quot;</i>
<p>
Ah, but if Boniface did that, then Bill Wilson would have a hard time
getting it &quot;verified&quot; as coming from Boniface, wouldn't he?

<p>
Bill wrote back that he felt that the attitude of the Catholic Church
towards his psychic contacts was narrow-minded and unreasonable:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;It doesn't seem reasonable to think that the Devil's agents have such
direct and wide open access to us when other well-disposed discarnates including
the Saints themselves cannot get through. That is, in any direct way.
Since prudent discrimination and good morality is necessary when we deal
with people in the flesh, why shouldn't these be the rule with discarnate, too.
So motivated, I don't see why the aperture should be so large in the direction
of the Devil and so small in the direction of all the good folks who have
gone ahead of us. One can't blame the Church for being cautious but I do
sometimes wonder if the view isn't rather narrow and even monopolistic.
To assume that all communications, not received under Church auspices,
are necessarily malign seems going pretty far. I'm not sure the Church
says this but that is what the inference always seems to be. I do say this,
though, more in the nature of speculation than argument, for the spook
business is no longer any burning issue so far as I am concerned.
Without inviting it, I still sometimes get an intrusion such as the one
I described in the case of the purported Boniface.&quot;<br>

Many of the early A.A. members were very disturbed by Bill Wilson's occult
activities, and they tried to get him to stop it. One, Sumner Campbell,
wrote to a man whom they all respected, C. S. Lewis
at Cambridge University in England, describing Bill Wilson's spook sessions and
asking his opinion. Lewis wrote back with total disapproval, saying,
<font color="blue">
&quot;This is necromancy. Have nothing to do with it.&quot;</font>
Bill Wilson ignored the criticism and continued
conducting his s&eacute;ances and communicating with the dead people each evening
anyway.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>

Speaking of people trying to hide the truth,
the lengths to which some true-believer Alcoholics Anonymous apologists will
go to rationalize and explain away Bill Wilson's occult practices are
both disgusting and amusing.
In her white-washing biography of Bill Wilson, Susan Cheever
(also author of <i>Note Found In A Bottle</i>), wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Perhaps we are right to think that the dead are gone forever, locked away somewhere
that makes communication with us impossible. Or perhaps that isn't what has happened.
Perhaps what has happened is that our modern world distracts us and distances us
so completely that we no longer hear the voices of the dead. Even when we are
present at a deathbed, and this is a rare occurrence, the corpse is whisked away
by men from the funeral home and reappears in a sanitized version, dressed and made
up and laid in an expensive box.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Usually, though, the coffin is closed, and the grave prepared by strangers and then
filled in by them after everyone has gone home. Today we are so removed from the
process of dying and burying the dead that it's no wonder that the dead don't
seem to be around. Both Bill Wilson and Bob Smith came from a different world,
an old-fashioned world where the difference between the living and the dead
was not as clear.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sometimes the Wilsons used a Ouija board. A flat piece of wood marked with
two lines of alphabet and two lines of numbers....<br>

<p>
What unmitigated bull. I have personally seen a family member die. Then
friends and I dug the hole and made the coffin, and conducted the funeral,
but that experience did not make me suddenly start conducting s&eacute;ances
and playing with Ouija boards, trying to communicate with the spirits
of the dead.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Also notice how Susan Cheever is actually trying to rationalize away Bill Wilson's
crazy occult practices with
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;</i>:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Perhaps ... the dead are
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>NOT</i>
</font>
gone forever, locked away somewhere that makes communication with us impossible...&quot;<br>
</font>
As in,
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Maybe we just can't hear the dead people as well as Bill Wilson could...&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
I am curious: Does Susan Cheever personally conduct s&eacute;ances and practice
necromancy, or is she just trying to argue that it was perfectly reasonable
for Bill Wilson to do it? Did Susan conduct spook sessions and contact the
spirit of Bill Wilson during her research for her book, to get more
intimate details about Bill's life? If not, why not? Doesn't she really believe in it?
Does Susan Cheever really believe that practicing necromancy is crazy?
</font>

<p>
Susan Cheever appears to be <i>in denial</i> when it comes to the truth
about Bill Wilson, and she will go to extreme lengths to try to make
Bill Wilson out to be a great man &#8212; even a genuine psychic &#8212;
rather than a mental case and a fraud.
She even ended her chapter about <i>The Spook Room</i> by strongly implying
that Bill was right &#8212; that he really did talk with dead people.
Cheever wrote that each evening, Bill and Lois would conduct a
s&eacute;ance, and:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A quiet would come over them, almost as if they were conducting a group
meditation. Lois would calm her beating heart and gaze out at her gardens.
Up the hill, in the fading light, she could just make out the outline of
Wit's End. Bill would take his place on the long sofa &#8212; one of the few pieces
of furniture that could accommodate his entire length.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Outside, they could hear birdsong, the warblers and finches from the garden.
Sometimes Bill would unfold his body from the sofa, take down one of his violins,
and saw out some sweet country tune. Then he would lie down and there would
be silence again in the room, now lit with a few candles.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There would be a slight, almost imperceptible stir in the silent air, as
if someone had come invisibly to keep them company. The curtains rustled in
the evening breeze. The smoke rising from the ashtray wavered.
The smell of the outdoors, the new-mown grass in the summer or smoke from
the piles of burning leaves in the autumn, would fade from their senses.
Even the sounds from nature seemed to enter the trance. 
They could hear a silence beyond silence. Then there would be an almost
inaudible tap, or Bill's quiet voice would begin to form a letter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill and Lois had a rich past together, and on these evenings they were in
the presence of the past, in the company of the Yankee householders clustered
around their kitchen tables on cold nights before they had electricity.
They were in the presence of all their own dead, of Bill's cousin Clarence
whose sad violin had been Bill's first fiddle, and the stern Fayette and
Ella Griffith, of Lois's beloved mother, and her handsome father who read
Swedenborg's teachings to his children in their Clinton Street living room,
of all those who had passed on before them.<br>

<p>
You have to give Susan Cheever credit where credit is due &#8212; she has a poetic way with
words. You can almost smell the autumn leaves burning. You can almost see the
Bedford Hills woods in the fall.
But all of that picturesque fluff has absolutely nothing to do with Bill Wilson
being a phony psychic and a nut-case who dabbled in the occult.
Cheever should learn that there is an immense difference
between spirituality and superstition.
There is also a big difference between &quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;spiritism&quot;.

critical life-or-death issue of alcohol addiction from some wackos and crazies who
think that conducting s&eacute;ances and spook sessions and talking to 
ghosts and spirits of the dead &#8212; necromancy &#8212;
is perfectly normal and acceptable behavior, and even a jolly good thing to do?

Father Dowling's attitude towards Bill Wilson's
<i>&quot;channelling&quot;</i> reveals another
problem with the occult: Bill made the mistake that a lot of
occultists make &#8212; he simply assumed that the spirits with whom
he was supposedly making contact
were usually good, benevolent spirits who had only the best of
intentions towards the living &#8212; in spite of
<a href="#malign_mischievous">his description of a s&eacute;ance 
where evil souls also came visiting</a>:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;There were malign and mischievous ones of all descriptions,
telling of vices quite beyond my ken...&quot;
</i></font>
Channellers like to assume that because a spirit does not have a
physical body, that it can not be selfish.
Logically, if people turn into ghosts, then there must be all kinds of
evil ghosts around, left over from evil people, of whom there is
certainly no shortage in this world.
Why couldn't Bill or any other channeller be accidentally channelling
the ghost of Adolf Hitler or Caligula or some serial killer who
just got executed?
<p>
Why should death transform an evil personality
like Adolf Hitler into a kindly, loving spirit who will just always
tell us the truth and only pass on the best of cosmic wisdom to us?
I see little reason to believe that death would just suddenly
make an angel out of Adolf.
If we are channelling and opening ourselves up to random spirits,
why wouldn't a creep like Hitler occasionally show up and lie to us
about who he is,
and try to fool us into thinking that he was a good ghost,
and then try to poison our hearts and minds with his evil and his hatred?
After all, that's pretty much what he did while he was alive.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
And Bill Wilson was assuming a lot when he assumed that he would always be
able to tell the difference between the good ghosts and the bad ghosts
who came a'visiting.
Presumably, the really clever bad ghosts won't tell you that they have evil ulterior
motives. They will lie to you. After all, they <i>are</i> evil spirits, aren't they?
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
For that matter, why mess around with the small fry? I mean, Bill Wilson
and Frank Buchman insisted that we would talk to nothing less than God Almighty Himself
when we sought
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank"><i>Guidance</i></a> during our <i>Quiet Time</i>.
So why couldn't &#8212; wouldn't &#8212; the Big Guy for the Other Side show up?
And how could we tell for sure which one was talking to us?
After all, Lucifer was said to be very beautiful &#8212; he was The Angel of Light
before his big fall. &#8212; And he is now said to be very clever and very convincing.

<p><br>
In their excellent book, <i>&quot;The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power&quot;</i>, the authors Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad
talked about channelling. One of the problems with channelling
that they brought up was just how
many completely unfounded assumptions come along with the idea of
channelling, in an unconsciously accepted package deal:
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<li> Being disembodied makes the entity a pure (or purer) voice
of cosmic wisdom and spirituality.
<li> The entity not only knows more, but can access information
otherwise inaccessible, or at least exceedingly difficult to get
on one's own.
<li> The entity tells the truth.
<li> People's well-being is the entity's basic interest.
<li> The entity knows what's best for a given human or humans in
general.
<li> These entities would not be motivated by power or wrongly
manipulate those who come to them. In short, they have no self-interest.
<li> One is better off getting the information than not.
<li> The fact that most channels put forth a similar message and share
a similar worldview is sufficient proof that what they say must
be for the most part true.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power</i>, Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad, page 123.</font>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, like we were saying, everybody just assumes that they are not
channelling the spirit of Hannibal Lecter or Theodore Bundy or
Jeffrey Dahmer.
And, for that matter, nobody ever seems to get Forrest Gump, either.
It's always Cleopatra or St. Francis of Assisi or Joan of Arc or some
genius like Einstein...
<p>
Worse yet, everybody just happily assumes that &quot;the spirits&quot; know what they are
talking about, and tell the truth, and really do have peoples' best interests
at heart. We have, of course, no evidence to support such giddy Pollyanna beliefs.

Kramer and Alstad go on to describe <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, which
is described by its promoters as a manual that will teach you how to be
a channeller, and which will even put you in contact with the spirit of
Jesus Christ, they say.

<p>

<table width="93%" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="6">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

In their book <i>Crazy Therapies</i>, Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer and
Janja Lalich described <i>A Course In Miracles</i> this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another remarkable publication, <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, first
came forth in 1975. Helen Schucman, a psychologist at Columbia
University, claimed that for seven years, starting in 1965, she
had been the channel for the voice of none other than Jesus.
According to Schucman, &quot;the Voice&quot; began by saying,
&quot;This is a course in miracles...&quot; with such force that
Schucman felt compelled to take notes. The Voice's dictations resulted
in a twelve-hundred-page work, including a teacher's manual,
which was published in three volumes by several of Schucman's
colleagues. Initially, hundreds of thousands of sets were sold by
word of mouth. To date, the current publisher claims that more than
a million copies of the three-volume set have been sold.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The <i>Course</i>, or ACIM (as it is sometimes referred to by its
advocates), has been wildly popular and regarded as helpful by
many since the 1980s. Yet in discussions or reviews it is rarely
mentioned that Schucman was raised in a metaphysical environment,
that she professed to receive signs from God as early as age four,
and that the <i>Course</i> was little different from much of her
own previous writings that weren't &quot;channelled.&quot;<br>

<p>


Much of <i>A Course In Miracles</i> sounds disconcertingly similar to some
aspects of Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...the course more than intimates that through the proper practice
(doing its lessons), anyone can become a channel for the spirit of
Christ.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All channelled information, including religions, creates a closed
system that is entirely self-referential. Any challenges from outside
can be deflected by calling them limited understanding.
So there is little to be gained from debating the validity of the
<i>Course's</i> worldview. Rather, we want to show that its worldview
is renunciate, and contrary to the posture that people must rely
on themselves, <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is authoritarian.
We single it out because it is a classic example of programming
thought to renunciate beliefs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Although the <i>Course</i> calls itself essentially Christian, it does
away with Christianity's more unpalatable dogmas, such as sin,
a judgemental God, and damnation. Instead, like the Eastern Oneness
perspective, it calls the world we live in an illusion to be transcended
and is specific about calling all separation an
illusion.
It likewise denigrates the self and self-centeredness with such
statements as &quot;Either God or ego is insane.&quot;
Its central message is that through surrendering to God's will,
which is pure love, illusions will evaporate and one will be
eternally at one with God. The essential methodology used to
achieve this is forgiveness. Instead of being forgiven for sin
through Christ, however, the new message is that through forgiving
one can transform one's life and become Christ-like.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Forgiving consists of letting go of all judgements and grievances
towards others and towards the circumstances of the world at large.
The ideal is to forgive
unconditionally.<font size="-1"><sup>6</sup></font>
The very doing of this is said to loosen the bonds of ego that keep
people from their birthright, which is experiencing eternal love
without fear. Sin is redefined as lack of love, so forgiveness is not
of sin, but instead of error, or rather of one's own and other's
illusions.
Illusions are presented as the cause of all enmity and suffering,
which is similar to certain Hindu and Buddhist perspectives.
Letting go of past pains can have psychological benefits; but to
turn this into a prescription for salvation ensures doing so
becomes an idealized mold that denies and represses vital aspects
of being human. This is the real danger of the <i>Course</i>,
and of renunciate religion in general.<br>
<hr>
<a name="unconditional_love2"> </a>
<font size="-1"><sup>6</sup></font>
&quot;Love and Control: The Conditions Underlying Unconditional
Love&quot; describes how the ideal of unconditional love is a
prescription of a renunciate moral order that insidiously impacts
emotions and relationships, distorting the experience and expression
of love. Its sections &quot;Forgiving and Letting Go&quot; and
&quot;The Religious Freedom of Unconditional Love&quot; show how
these ideals mask their underlying authoritarianism and why they
are unlivable. Ideals of unconditional forgiveness or unconditional
compassion (the Buddhist version) are variations on the same theme
that create unlivable standards of emotional purity.<br>
</font>
<hr>
<font size="-1"><i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power</i>, Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad, pages 125-127.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

To start at the top, Alcoholics Anonymous is also a channelled
religion. Step Eleven specifically instructs members to practice
channelling every day. This is simply a continuation of Frank Buchman's
doctrine of
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Russell_Quiet_Time" target="_blank">
<i>The Quiet Time</i></a> where one makes oneself into a
channel to receive
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank"><i>Guidance</i></a>
from God:
<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The authors correctly point out that a
channelled religion creates a completely
self-referential system. One cannot criticize it or find fault with
it because any criticism can be deflected by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Well, you just haven't done the practices
long enough to know the truth. Try our path for a year,
and then you will see.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
A.A. has just that problem. Anyone who questions A.A. dogma gets
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm" target="_blank">
condescending put-downs</a> that he is &quot;just a newcomer, a baby,
and
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">
hasn't been a member long enough to know</a>&quot;.
He is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God...&quot;</font>
<font size="-1" target="_blank">(<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#conscious_contact"><i>Big Book</i>, page 87</a>.)</font>
It is difficult to counter the claims that if you just practice
the Steps long enough, hard enough,
<i>&quot;working a strong enough program&quot;</i>, that you, too,
will eventually receive Divine Guidance and begin to see the truth of
the A.A. program and the brilliance of Bill Wilson.
<p>

Then we have several other points of similarity between Alcoholics
Anonymous and <i>A Course in Miracles</i>: Both are authoritarian
and renunciate, both demand that your &quot;self, self-centeredness,
and ego&quot; be crushed, both demand that you
&quot;surrender to God's will&quot;
<font color="#9F0000">[really, surrender to the cult]</font>,
and both indulge in grandiose babbling about super-human purity and
unconditional love.
<p>
<a name="unconditional_love"> </a>
Look closely at the A.A. statements that newcomers will receive
&quot;complete acceptance&quot; and &quot;unconditional love&quot;.

Such grandiose claims are ridiculous on the face of it &#8212; because they are
actually accompanied by veiled demands that the newcomer quit drinking,
<i>Keep Coming Back</i>, get a sponsor, <i>Work The Steps</i>, and
believe in A.A. &#8212;
but there is much more to it than just that:
<ul>
<li>
First off, the other side of the coin
is that the older members must grant all of that
&quot;complete acceptance&quot; and &quot;unconditional love&quot;
to the newcomers, whether they really wish to or not.
<li>
Then there is the problem that, as a member, you must suppress
your own feelings about other people, and your own moral standards, too.
You cannot form your own opinions of other members or their conduct &#8212;
that would be judgemental and &quot;unloving&quot;.

They call it
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;taking someone else's inventory&quot;</i></font>.

You are supposed to just keep giving others that &quot;complete acceptance&quot;
and &quot;unconditional love&quot;, and never criticize their behavior, no matter what...<br>
<font color="#9F0000">(The relevant slogan is:
&quot;If you point a finger at someone else, you will
find three pointed back at you.&quot;)</font><br>

<li>
Sometimes, this has been taken to such an extreme that when women
A.A. members are raped by other A.A. members, or seduced by their sponsors,
or &quot;13th-Stepped&quot;, as they call it, the women are supposed to &quot;just
accept it&quot;, and &quot;find their part in it&quot;,
and &quot;stuff their feelings.&quot;
Women have even been told to
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#rape_part" target="_blank">&quot;make amends&quot; by apologizing to their rapists</a>.
(Apologize for what?)
</ul>
<p>

Kramer and Alstad point out:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Love and self-sacrifice are joined in all renunciate moralities.
When unconditional love is made into a prescription of how to be,
it is really an authoritarian mechanism of control.
If one gives, or loves, or forgives willingly, it isn't a sacrifice.
They become sacrifices when done because of an ideal.
Here one is not only controlled by the ideal but wants others to
be controlled by it, too.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power</i>, Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad, page 297.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So all of the appeals for, and demands for, complete acceptance
and unconditional love are
really just another mechanism of authoritarian control &#8212; especially,
of authoritarian mind control:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You <i>must</i> feel unconditional love for the other members. You
<i>must</i> feel acceptance, and grant it to the others.&quot;</font>
<p>
(Never mind that fact that coerced unconditional love isn't really
love at all.)

<p>
But the grandiose demands for &quot;complete acceptance&quot; and
&quot;unconditional love&quot; are basically impossible to fulfill,
because they are too lofty, too angelic, and totally unrealistic.
As Kramer and Alstad wrote:
<font color="blue">
&quot;Ideals of unconditional forgiveness or unconditional compassion
(the Buddhist version) are variations on the same theme that create
unlivable standards of emotional purity.&quot;
</font>
Such high ideals are just some more examples of the standard cult characteristic of
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_perfection" target="_blank">An Impossible,
Superhuman Model of Perfection</a>&quot;. Such standards are things which are
great for making people feel inadequate, inferior, and guilty,
because people can't live up to them, but those super-human standards
are not much good for anything else. 
<p>
No sane person would even want to live by such high-falutin' standards.
Imagine that you are in an A.A. meeting, and one of the other
members &quot;shares&quot; the confession that he has been
kidnapping, raping, and murdering little girls during full moons.
Would you really feel obligated to give him &quot;complete
acceptance&quot; and &quot;unconditional love&quot;?
I sincerely hope that you would feel disgust and anger and call
the police on him, fast.
<p>
<font color="blue">
(And that example is not too much of an exaggeration:
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#confessional" target="_blank">The Paul Cox case</a>
featured an A.A. member who confessed in and after an A.A. meeting that
he had murdered a doctor and his wife while on a drunken binge. Another A.A.
member told the police.)
</font>

<p>
On a more mundane level, would you wish to give him complete
acceptance if he confesses that he throws temper tantrums and
beats his wife or kids regularly?
Or mugs gays and blacks for the fun of it?
Shouldn't you rightly criticize him and tell him to stop behaving in such a despicable manner?<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>(But if you do, that's &quot;cross-talk&quot;, which is forbidden...
And they might silence you with the slogan:
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;When I point a finger at my neighbor, I find three pointed back
at me.&quot;</font>)</i>
</font>

<p>
On a more practical level, I find that I simply do not like all
of the people I meet at A.A. meetings, and I don't even want to
be friends with some of them, never mind pretend that I am giving
them complete acceptance and unconditional love.
And I certainly don't want to look like I am granting complete
acceptance, or even approval, when they tell me about some of their bad habits.
And I don't feel guilty about that, either &#8212; as a functional
adult, I claim the right to decide for myself whom I will accept
into my life, and to what I will give my approval and acceptance.


<p><br>
Kramer and Alstad continued describing the <i>Course in Miracles</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
What is not noteworthy about the <i>Course</i> is its worldview,
which is not essentially new, but a mixture of Eastern mysticism
with Christian love and forgiveness.
Of more interest to us is its claim of not being authoritarian.
It is overtly stated that it is not necessary to believe any of the
<i>Course's</i> assertions to experience the promised transformations:
<blockquote>
<font face="Swiss,Helvetica">
You need not believe the ideas... accept them... [nor] even welcome
them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter,
or decrease their efficacy.
</font>
</blockquote>
All that is required is conscientious daily practice of the lessons.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power</i>, Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad, pages 127-128.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The claim that you don't have to believe in the stuff masks the fact
that
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>you have to believe in the stuff</i>.</font><br>
Why else would you do it every day?<br>
Why else would you do it at all?<br>
<i>Why else would you even want to do it?</i><br>
<p>
And, even if you are a bit skeptical to start with, you will
gradually get converted into believing all of it:
<p>
<a name="try_it"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The <i>Course</i> is but another revealed (by an unchallengeable
authority) renunciate ideology that separates the spiritual from
the mundane, the pure from the impure, the selfless from the
self-centered. It says listen to your own voice, but programs what
your voice will say by taking away the validity of experience,
reason, thoughts, and disapproved of emotions. Like gurus, it then
fills the vacuum it creates with its own renunciate worldview offering
the same old coin of eternal bliss. Nothing could be more authoritarian,
for who could argue against a disembodied spirit with the credentials
of a traditional God? If one were to say (as we do) that one's inner
voice says something quite different, then what?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When challenged, adherents often cavalierly reply, &quot;Do the lessons
and you'll see for yourself. Besides, you can't know the <i>Course</i>
or criticize it until you try it.&quot; From our perspective,
this confidence merely shows that those willing to be programmed
get programmed. To understand why this is so, one must not only
examine the exercises, but also the nature of the mind that is willing
to do them daily for an extended time.<br>

Bill Wilson described how the Alcoholics Anonymous practice of channelling also
gradually converts the newcomer doubters into true believers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<!-------------------------------------
In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had
restored us to sanity and had enabled us
to live with some peace of mind in a sorely
troubled world, then such a Higher Power
was worth knowing better, by as
direct contact as possible.
------------------------------------------- -->

The persistent use of
meditation and prayer, we found, <font color="#9F0000">did open the channel</font> so
that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river
which led to sure power and safe guidance from
<font color="#9F0000">God as we were

<a name="group_power"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question. Looking at those who were
only beginning and still doubting themselves,
<font color="#9F0000">the rest of us were
able to see the change setting in.</font>
From great numbers of such experiences, we could
predict that <font color="#9F0000">the doubter</font> who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power,
<font color="#9F0000">would presently love God and call Him by name.</font><br>

</blockquote>

</font></td></tr></table>
</center>

<p><br>
Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad,
the authors of <i>The Guru Papers</i>, went on to describe an adherent
of this <i>Course in Miracles</i>: He
was alienated from the real world &#8212; he wanted an ideal world
&quot;where non-violence, compassion, selflessness, and love
would reign supreme.&quot; But the actual world around him wasn't so nice,
or so easy. The adherent said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The more I faced the 'real world,' the less real I felt.&quot;
</font>
So he gravitated towards
a worldview where such ideals did reign supreme. He got his ideal
world by denying the reality of this world where those ideals
do not reign supreme, and insisting on the reality of a higher,
more moral, truly spiritual world that was more to his liking:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <i>&quot;This is all an illusion.&quot;</i> 
<li> <i>&quot;Nothing here is real.&quot;</i>
<li> <i>&quot;The spiritual world is the true reality, and that world
really <i>is</i> governed by the principles of love, justice,
non-violence, compassion, selflessness, etc...&quot;</i>
<li> <i>&quot;Nothing I see here means anything.&quot;</i> 
<li> <i>&quot;This can all be transcended.&quot;</i>
<li> As the Beatles sang (perhaps a bit in spoof)
<i>&quot;Nothing is real,
nothing to get up tight about.&quot;</i>
<font size="-1">(<i>Strawberry Fields Forever</i>)</font>
</ul>
<p>
Thus the misguided idealist renounces this world that has disappointed
him, and he also denies his own
thoughts and feelings which are in and about this world &#8212;
he can &quot;stuff his feelings&quot; and suppress his anger,
disappointment, rage, pain, and sorrow, and just pretend to
feel only eternal bliss and joy (or &quot;Serenity and Gratitude&quot;)
because the &quot;true reality&quot; is just fine.
He programs himself to only believe in and accept the reality of
his perfect dream world. It's the ultimate escape artist's trick.

frightened and purposeless. The moment we catch even a glimpse of God's will,
the moment we begin to see truth, justice, and love as the real and eternal things
in life, we are no longer deeply disturbed by all the seeming evidence to the
contrary that surrounds us in purely human affairs. We know that God lovingly
watches over us. We know that when we turn to Him, all will be well with us,
here and hereafter.<br>

The tendency to ignore this world, and only believe in the perfection

people to be politically reactionary, quite happily ignoring the plight of the
poor and homeless, the down-trodden and unemployed, and the sick and dying,
because it is obviously <i>God's Will</i> that they suffer so...

There are many striking similarities between that <i>Course In
Miracles</i> and the Alcoholics Anonymous program:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Both practice channelling. Both teach that you should receive
wisdom and instructions from a &quot;Higher Power&quot; or a Spiritual Being
who resides on &quot;a higher plane of existence&quot;, and
who will talk to you in a s&eacute;ance or &quot;Quiet Time&quot; or
&quot;meditation session&quot; or &quot;spook session&quot;.
<p>
<li> Both say that you don't have to believe in the program for it
to work:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous requires no beliefs.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.
All of its Twelve Steps are but suggestions.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1" color="black"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 26.</font><br>

<font color="#9F0000">
<i>But you really have to believe in it.</i></font><br>
In fact,
Bill Wilson went on and on in
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">Chapter Four of the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
raving about how we all had to
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank"><b><i>abandon Reason</i>
and just <i>have Faith</i></b></a>.&quot;
Wilson spent one whole chapter of the <i>Big Book</i> talking about nothing
but how all atheists, agnostics, and independent thinkers had to
be converted to believing in his Buchmanite religion. (Chapter Four teaches nothing
about how to quit drinking &#8212; it's all about how you <i>must</i> believe in Bill Wilson's
peculiar religious beliefs. And then they <i>still</i> use that deceptive
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;no beliefs required&quot;</i></font> slogan. Go figure.)
<p>
<li>
Both have practices that you must do every day. The
<i>Course in Miracles</i> has its &quot;lessons&quot;, and A.A. has
its Twelve Steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily
reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.

all of our activities.<br>

<p>
We just covered how you practice channelling &#8212; Step Eleven &#8212; during
your morning
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">Quiet Hour</a>&quot;
<p>

Another daily practice is the Twelfth Step &#8212; <i>Go Recruiting</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery.

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

<p>
Note that &quot;helping others&quot; is a euphemism &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">cult-speak</a> &#8212;
for recruiting new cult members.
You &quot;help them&quot; by deceiving them and
<a href="orange-recruit.html#arousing_prejudice" target="_blank">hiding the religious
nature of the Alcoholics Anonymous program</a>, until later.

Note how Bill Wilson recommended that you spend so much time
recruiting that your wife complains that you are neglecting her.
Bill did.

It's that serious. Selfishness usually leads to relapse. And relapse,
in our case, is often fatal. Now, we can't rely on ourselves to be
rid of our self-centeredness &#8212; it would be rather self-centered to
think we could, don't you think? There's help. God can deliver us from

</font>

</ul>
<p>
So, according to Bill Wilson and A.A., self is nothing but bad, and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">you cannot trust yourself</a>.
<p>
A corollary to these demands for ego-destruction is the implicit
belief that your innermost self is essentially dishonest and evil.
(That is a
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Gnostic_heresy" target="_blank">Gnostic heresy</a>.)
Remember Star Trek, with the Good Kirk versus the Bad Kirk?
Well, according to A.A. theology, you also have a good self and a
bad self, and the bad self is stronger, and usually wins, unless
it is constantly beaten down.
(Which your sponsor and the other group elders will be more than happy
to do for you.)

<p>
<li> Both the <i>Course In Miracles</i> and Alcoholics Anonymous indulge
in grandiose talk about &quot;pure love&quot;, &quot;unconditional love&quot;,
&quot;complete acceptance&quot;, and other
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_perfection" target="_blank">super-human purity</a> which
is impossible for members to attain.
We already covered that above.
<p>
<li> So both also induce feelings of guilt and inadequacy in their members.
<p>
<li> Both ACIM and A.A. say that
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">it isn't a religion</a>&quot;, even though
they push a self-contained worldview complete with a well-defined God
and a prescribed <i>&quot;way of life&quot;</i>.
<p>
<li> They teach you to deny the reality of your own feelings and
your own thoughts:<br>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Stuff your feelings.&quot;
<li> &quot;Feelings aren't facts!&quot;
<li> &quot;You should feel Serenity and Gratitude.&quot;
<li> &quot;You have a thinking problem, not a drinking problem.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stop your stinkin' thinkin'&quot;
<li> &quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;
<li> If you disagree with A.A. about anything, then &quot;You are in denial.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
You must essentially distrust and renounce your
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_feel" target="_blank">feelings</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">thoughts</a>
about this world, and instead emphasize the reality of the
revelations and work orders that supposedly come to you from
<i>A Higher Power</i> while you practice Step Eleven.
<p>
&#8212; But then they tell you that you can't even trust that.
You cannot trust yourself when it comes to either admitting your faults or
hearing the voice of God. You must submit all of your received <i>Guidance</i>
to your sponsor or the other group elders for their approval, because:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If all our lives we had more or less fooled ourselves, how could we
now be so sure that we weren't still self-deceived?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... what comes to us alone may be garbled by our
own rationalization and wishful thinking.
The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get
his direct comment and counsel on our situation, and there can
be no doubt in our minds what that advice is.
Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; 
Surely then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 59-60.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So it doesn't even matter what
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">Guidance</a>&quot;
you think you receive from your &quot;Higher Power&quot;. Your sponsor
will tell you what you <i>should have</i> received.
Again, we get the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Gnostic_heresy" target="_blank">Gnostic heresy</a>
that you (and all alcoholics) are inherently corrupt, so dishonest and deceitful
that you cannot even be trusted while you pray and meditate and listen to God.

<p>
Note that Frank Buchman claimed that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Russell_Quiet_Time" target="_blank">
he could tell whether someone's thoughts came from God or not</a>.
Buchman never explained how he got that
magical power, but when he listened to people
reading their pages of received <i>&quot;Guidance&quot;</i>, he didn't hesitate to
pronounce some thoughts &quot;God-given&quot;, and some not.
<p>
But Bill Wilson never claimed that he had any such ability.
That creates a big problem. How could Bill's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s turn
to Bill for verification of their received messages from God?
Logically, they couldn't, because he wouldn't know what
&quot;The True Word of God&quot; was
any more than they did. So how could they be sure that the whole
A.A. clubhouse wasn't just foolishly deceiving itself, going off on
a crazy
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#hardly_fail" target="_blank">spiritual tangent</a>&quot;?
Whom could they trust to really know for sure what God's will was? Nobody.

<p>
<li> Likewise, A.A. also promotes a <i>&quot;renunciate worldview
offering the same old coin of eternal bliss.&quot;</i>
Except that the wording that A.A. uses is &quot;Serenity and
Gratitude&quot;.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;If you work the Steps enough, and Seek and Do the Will of God
enough, you too can feel uninterrupted Serenity and Gratitude.&quot;</i>
</font>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Bill Wilson wrote a list of such <i>Promises</i> in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<P>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
<font color="#9F0000">[doing Step Ten]</font>, we
will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will comprehend the
word serenity and we will know peace. &nbsp; ...<br>
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will
disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain
interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole
attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and
of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know
how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly
realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.<br>

rid of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;selfish things.&quot;)

<p>
Obviously, such a <i>Course in Miracles</i> that ostensibly
teaches &quot;how to channel&quot; is a ticket to travel
right out of this world. The promoters of the course hint that it
is a ticket to Heaven. Others would suggest that it's a trip to Hell.
<p>
And Alcoholics Anonymous has the same problem.

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="AA_cure"> </a>
<h2><li> The A.A. &quot;Cure&quot;</h2>
<p>
Later in their book, Kramer and Alstad specifically talked about
Alcoholics Anonymous, and said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Although overtly leaderless (actually, old-time members assume leadership
roles), A.A. shares many features of authoritarian cults: an
unchallengeable written authority (&quot;The Word&quot;); commandments
or rules to live by; a conversion experience achieved through
inducing surrender to a super-human power; and dependency on the
group, which often undermines relationships with those who do not
accept the sanctity of the 12 Steps. Disagreement with any of the
Steps is labeled denial or resistance. Like other authoritarian groups
that manipulate fear and desire, fear of leaving is instilled by
the often repeated warning, &quot;You can't make it without us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As is true of every authoritarian structure, surrender is the key
to making it work. Part One of this book details how the act of
surrender itself has potent psychological repercussions.
Giving control to something envisioned as more powerful and worthy
than oneself not only temporarily eliminates conflict, but often
enables one to feel renewed and even reborn. Feeling &quot;reborn&quot;
is characteristic of all religious conversion experiences which,
when combined with repentance and amends, gives an aura of wiping the
moral slate clean. In A.A. what one is actually surrendering to are
the 12 Steps and the unchallengeable assertion that if one &quot;works
the Steps&quot; properly and long enough, they will perform the
miracle of sobriety. But this miracle still requires continual group
support because the 12 Steps do not eliminate one's inner split,
but rather act to strengthen one side by suppressing the other.
The goodself cannot contain the badself all on its own, no matter
how lofty an ideology it assumes (or surrenders to).
This is why it is important for such programs to have people
acknowledge powerlessness for life, and thus be in continual need
not only of the 12-Step ideology, but of group support.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The A.A. model not only programs people not to trust themselves,
self-mistrust is essential for it to work. Its litany is, &quot;The
12 Steps work &#8212; don't question them.&quot;
When someone does drop out, sure enough the addiction (the badself)
resurfaces &#8212; as warned. On returning to A.A., the &quot;We told
you so&quot; smug reproof further locks in the belief of being
powerless. The group acts like a chorus of goodselves whose refrain
is &quot;You'll always lose control on your own.&quot;
A.A. interprets its ability to predict relapses as a verification
of its ideology (rather than of its ineffectiveness), using
this to tighten authoritarian control over its members. But the
model of a divided self explains far better why even after years
of sobriety the siren-song of excess lurks beneath the surface,
leaving no choice but to &quot;take it [sobriety] one day at a
time.&quot;<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... there are some, particularly proponents of responsibility models,
who seriously challenge the long-term efficacy of A.A. and its
success rate. How well A.A. actually works is not our focus.
Authoritarian structures of all sorts do indeed work to the
degree that those in them obey their precepts. Like most authoritarian
belief systems, the 12 Steps provide a powerful, mechanical
strategy with fairly predictable results for those who conform.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A key question is how is &quot;work&quot; defined? We do not doubt
that abstinence through A.A. could be far better for some than
their previous desperate, dysfunctional lives. These programs can
enable divided people to function in a social order whose values
promulgate their inner division. Yet leading a manageable life
only through believing that one is unalterably sick is a very limited
view of recovery. If stability is dependent on continually acknowledging
one's basic powerlessness, it is seriously flawed. What remains
is the underlying fear that one is untrustworthy at the deepest level.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Cures&quot; that do not bring an integration are disabling
in their own way. People who fear being taken over at any instant
by an element within themselves are crippled, though often less overtly
so than before the goodself (with outside help) gained the upper hand.
Any framework that does not take the division within people into
account can never truly implement a cure, if by cure one means
an integrated being who has self-trust, and thus is not susceptible
to authoritarian manipulation. To live in fear of oneself is to be
psychologically crippled.<br>

...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If addiction is an illness, the disease is authoritarianism.
As in so many other areas, the cure society offers for the ills it
creates and exacerbates through coercion is more coercion.
Not only are 12-Step programs authoritarian, people (teens,
employees, drunk drivers, wife-beaters) are being coerced to enter
them as an alternative to more severe punishment. The 12 Steps work
to the extent they do because they mirror the division within
the social and moral order, helping divided people fit into a
society that helped divide them.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is not surprising that a society with a polarized morality and
a deep fundamentalist strain frames addiction as either bad or sick
&#8212; &quot;sick&quot; becomes an ambiguous category that is at least
not bad. The somber truth is that addicts are neither ill nor evil...<br>

<h2><li> Guidance</h2>
<p>
While we are talking about the problems with the Oxford Group and Alcoholics
Anonymous practice of dabbling in the occult,
there are very serious theological problems with Frank Buchman's whole doctrine of
receiving constant
&quot;Guidance&quot; from God, and with Bill Wilson's copy of it in Step Eleven, too:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>Step 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Richardson_guidance" target="_blank">Rev. John A. Richardson
wrote about such 'Guidance'</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is difficult to conceive anything more degrading. The theory
and practice of 'guidance' is not merely foolish and likely to lead
in practice to moral pitfalls. It is in itself fundamentally immoral....
Imagine a world in which everyone lived wholly by 'guidance,'
making each day simply the execution of commands received in the morning
'Quiet Time' and noted in the guidance book! All planning and thought,
everything permanent in human relationships and human purposes,
everything which makes life really human and worth living, would be
brushed aside as an irrelevant waste of time if this theory were worked
out to its logical conclusion and acted upon to the full&quot;
(&quot;Morals and the Group Movement,&quot; <i>The Nineteenth Century and
After</i>, Nov., 1933, p. 602).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I leave the subject by merely recording the opinion of the Rev. E. R.
Micklem, of Mansfield College, Oxford, one of the contributors to
<i>Oxford and the Groups</i>. &quot;To look for daily intimations,&quot;
he says, &quot;-- subtle promptings &#8212; which indicate the tasks God
has in mind for us, rather than to look for illumination on the way
of grasping the multifarious and obvious opportunities of service which
our ordinary daily life presents, is to attempt to live in a world
of mechanical responses rather than of personal relationships&quot; (p. 144).<br>

If we are supposed to just sit quietly every morning and
&quot;channel God&quot; and receive our work orders through
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot240.html#live_wires" target="_blank">spiritual live wires</a>&quot;
(as Frank Buchman called them), then we are reduced
to being nothing but mindless little robots that are remotely controlled by God,
just like the radio-controlled toy cars that you can buy at Radio Shack.
We don't need to think or plan or have a brain at all &#8212; we are just radio-controlled
toys, objects be moved here and there by the whims of God (or worse, by the whims of some
&quot;Higher Power&quot; who is not 'God').
<p>
That is grossly heretical. Nowhere in the Gospels did Jesus ever say that the
Christian life consists of being a mindless robot who just follows orders.

<h2><li> Holy Puppets and Radio-Controlled Cars</h2>

<p>
The very idea that you can give up on your life and become a puppet who
is remotely controlled by God and taken care of by God is heretical.
There is nothing in standard Christianity or in the Bible that
says that you can do that. Nor is there any such doctrine in Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism,
or any of the world's other great religions.

<p>
If the ideal spiritual life consists of being guided and manipulated by a &quot;Higher Power&quot;, then
Pinnochio the Puppet is a holy man.

<p>
And the radio-controlled toy cars that you can buy at Radio Shack must be very spiritual too.

<p>
It is also heretical to declare that the ideal Christian life consists
of being a mindless slave who is &quot;Guided&quot; by some &quot;Higher Power&quot;
in a Step-Eleven s&eacute;ance.  I am reminded of a criticism of
Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot; doctrine of &quot;Guidance by
God&quot; that Marjorie Harrison wrote. This is where the Alcoholics
Anonymous theology came from:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Bishop of London, speaking on the [Oxford] Group some time ago, said:
&quot;God has given us intelligence and reason to be the lamps to
guide us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Group by its interpretation of Divine Guidance advocates the
dowsing of these lamps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To return to the simile of a father and his children. The Group
teaches the child to regard his father not as a guide and
defence generally and a ready help in time of trouble, but
someone to whom the child turns for actual direction in everything
he does. Father, shall I play with my train or my bricks?
Father, shall I build a house or a bridge?
Father, shall I use red bricks or blue?
Father, shall I knock it down?
Father, shall I build it up?
Father this and father that, until a father might well wonder
whether his child is a half-wit, instead of a reasonable being.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Why should we storm the courts of Heaven to know whether we shall
buy cigarettes or take the 10.45 or the 11 o'clock train to town,
or as a critic has said: &quot;render God responsible for our
neckties or whether we choose to eat beef or mutton at luncheon.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Believe me, these instances are no exaggeration. Dr. Buchman acknowledges
that he asks for guidance for the expenditure on postage.<br>

<h2><li> Grandiose Presumptuousness and Fake Humility</h2>
<p>

Bill Wilson loved to brag about humility, but that is a sham.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are told in Al-Anon that there can be no progress without humility.
This idea is confusing to many at first, and it almost always encounters
a stubborn resistance in us. &quot;What!&quot; we say, &quot;am I
supposed to be a submissive slave to my situation and accept
everything that comes, however humiliating?&quot; No. True humility
does not mean a meek surrender to an ugly, destructive way of life.
It means surrender to God's will, which is quite a different thing.
Humility prepares us for the realization of God's will for us;
it shows us the benefits we gain from doing away with self-will.
We finally understand how this self-will has actually contributed to
our distress.<br>

<p>
(Notice
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#12X12q8" target="_blank">the word redefinition game</a>:
&quot;Humility&quot; does not mean &quot;surrender to God's will&quot;. Furthermore, the real
A.A. surrender is to the cult elders, not to God.)

<p>
<blockquote>

<p>

11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This step is just some
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">dabbling in the occult</a>,
an attempt to &quot;channel&quot; God and hear the Voice of God in a s&eacute;ance.
<p>
<a name="Dinger"> </a>
This is all of course merely the repetition of the <i>Oxford Group</i> practice of &quot;Guidance&quot;,
where they believed that anyone could sit quietly for 15 minutes or an hour, and get a message
from God.  A Catholic theologian criticized that belief with these words:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
What the <i>Group</i> has forgotten in all of this is that God ordinarily uses secondary causes
(public revelation as proposed by the Church, tradition, our own intellects, etc.) as
instruments for the attainment of truth. The Catholic, therefore, realizes that God does
not want us to set these lightly aside and seek truth directly and immediately from
His infinite knowledge. God wants us to seek Him, His Goodness and Truth, in all that
He has made and with all the means He has given us; otherwise, He has made all of these
in vain.
<p>
There is, indeed, a time for setting aside the use of our faculties and for practicing
the repose of passive prayer; but it is not at the beginning of the spiritual life. Such
a policy of action is wrong because it is based upon the presumption that each individual
has a proximate and individual call to the mystical life.<font size="-2"><sup>81</sup></font>
This attitude will inevitably lead to the errors of quietism, that infused contemplation
of the Infinite Truth and Goodness can be acquired at the beginning of the spiritual
life through one's own efforts and by the cessation of all operation,<font size="-2"><sup>82</sup></font>
How differently the prudent Catholic spiritual director acts, well and long trained in
the intricacies of theology and experienced in the guidance of souls. He realizes that
all souls are called in a general and remote manner to the mystical life,<font size="-2"><sup>83</sup></font>
but he does not presume to impose any soul upon the way of passive prayer (infused contemplation)
until definite signs of such an individual calling from God are provenly manifest.<font size="-2"><sup>84</sup></font>
<p>
Compare also the soul directed by the Catholic confessor secure in the truth of revealed Catholic
mystical and ascetical theology with the soul of the adherent of the <i>Group</i>,
insecure in the imaginings which come while listening for God's voice during a &quot;quiet time&quot;,
imposing themselves upon God with a daring which would have caused the saints to shudder!
<p>
But this is not all! It is not to the normal and ordinary divine intimacy of the mystical life
that MRA impels its members,<font size="-2"><sup>85</sup></font>
but to the extraordinary higher degrees!<font size="-2"><sup>86</sup></font>
And this is evident from what we have said about their expectation of divine
&quot;revelations.&quot; See this also in the light of Catholic teaching that humilty does not permit
one to aspire to these extraordinary degrees.<font size="-2"><sup>87</sup></font>

<p>
Indeed. For someone to simply assume that he can talk directly to God at any time that he chooses
to have a &quot;quiet time&quot;, and get divine answers on demand,
is the height of arrogance and egotism, the exact opposite of humility.
Ordinary people have to spend years in prayer and meditation
and contemplation  &#8212;  some spend lifetimes in monasteries  &#8212;  but Oxford Group members
and Alcoholics Anonymous members get direct contact with God in 15 minutes.
  

<p>
In truth, the A.A. attitude is, <b>&quot;I am so holy and so special that I have
a direct hotline to God, and He gives me His personal attention, and God talks to
me every day and gives me instructions and wisdom, and work orders and the power to carry
them out, in less than an hour, while God ignores the six billion other less-worthy
souls around the planet. Not only that, I am also very, very humble.&quot;</b>
<p>
That is not humility, that is extreme arrogance and delusions of grandeur.

**     is pride that apes humility.

<h2><li> Summon a Demon</h2>
<p>
<a name="show_me_a_sign"> </a>
Speaking of the occult, the way Bill Wilson tells the story of
his &quot;spiritual experience&quot; while detoxing in Towns Hospital,
Bill summoned up God the way that a wizard would summon up a demon by name:
<p>

This is part of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">
Robert Thomsen's description</a> of Bill Wilson's
&quot;spiritual experience&quot;

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
His fingers relaxed a little on the footboard [of the bed],
his arms slowly reached out and up. &quot;I want,&quot; he
said aloud. &quot;I want...&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ever since infancy</a>, they said, he'd been reaching out
this way, arms up, fingers spread, and as far back as he could
remember he'd been saying just that. But always before it
had been an unfinished sentence. Now it had its ending.
<i>He wanted to live.</i> He would do anything, anything,
to be allowed to go on living.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, God,&quot; he cried, and it was the sound not of a man,
but of a trapped and crippled animal.
&quot;<font color="#9F0000">If there is a God, show me. Show me.
Give me some sign.</font>&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As he formed the words, in that very instant he was
aware first of a light, a great white light that filled the
room, then he suddenly seemed caught up in a kind of joy, an
ecstasy such as he would never find words to describe.
&nbsp; ...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.</i>, Robert Thomsen, pages 222-223.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the A.A. book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> (1957)
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#aacoa_experience" target="_blank">
Bill described his experience</a> this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All at once I found myself crying out, &quot;<font color="#9F0000">If there is a God,
let Him show himself!</font>
I am ready to do anything, anything!&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Suddenly</a> the room lit up with a great white light.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
I thought to myself, &quot;So this is the God of the preachers!&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

In the book <i>Bill W.: My First 40 Years</i>, Bill Wilson described
his &quot;religious experience&quot; this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terrifying darkness had become complete. In agony of spirit,
I again thought of the cancer of alcoholism which had now consumed
me in mind and spirit, and soon the body. But what of the
Great Physician? For a moment, I suppose, the last trace of my
obstinacy was crushed out as the abyss yawned.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I remember saying to myself, &quot;I'll do anything, anything at
all. If there be a Great Physician, I'll call on him.&quot;
Then, with neither faith nor hope I cried out,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;If there be a God, let him show himself.&quot;</font>
The effect was instant, electric. Suddenly my room blazed with
an indescribably white light. I was seized with an ecstasy
beyond description. I have no words for this. Every joy I had
known was pale by comparison. The light, the ecstasy.
I was conscious of nothing else for a time.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.: My First 40 Years</i>, William G. Wilson,
pages 145-146.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that Mr. Wilson allegedly had the power to summon up the Spirit of God,
just by demanding that God show himself.
Ordinary sorcerers and wizards have to settle for summoning
up ordinary demons, but not Bill Wilson.
Bill Wilson waved his arms in the air and commanded
God Almighty Himself to appear (and Bill didn't even say &quot;Please&quot;):<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If there is a God, show me. Show me. Give me some sign.&quot;<br>
&quot;If there is a God, let Him show himself!&quot;<br>
&quot;If there be a God, let him show himself!&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
Also note that Bill was arrogantly demanding that God show him a sign.
We touched on that before, when Christ condemned the Pharisees for
demanding to see a miracle and seeking signs, in
<a href="#Pharisees">Matthew 12.38</a> and Matthew 16:1. 
<p>
<a name="Cheever2"> </a>
And although they seem to never come right out and say it directly, the
A.A. true believers often imply that somehow God had to answer Bill Wilson's
demand for a sign, or that God did give Bill a spiritual experience
because Bill demanded one:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As usual, Dr. Silkworth gave Bill belladonna and barbiturates, and as the
alcohol wore off, Bill sank into a deep depression.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Although he didn't believe in God, although he believed only in the power of
his own mind, he found himself begging God for help.
&quot;If there be a God, let him show himself!&quot; he cried.
The response was amazing. &quot;Suddenly my room blazed with
an indescribably white light...&quot;<br>

<p>
So Bill Wilson demanded that God show Himself, and God had to obey Bill Wilson...
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The response was amazing.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
Susan Cheever didn't bother to mention the inconvenient but important fact that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna</a> is a very
powerful hallucinogenic drug.
She just said that the doctor gave Bill belladonna and barbiturates in the
hospital, and then, when Bill demanded that God show Himself, the
results were &quot;amazing&quot; &#8212; Bill started to see things.
I would suggest that the &quot;amazing&quot; results were far more due to the
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna_recipe" target="_blank">hallucinogenic drug cocktail</a>
taking effect than due to Bill's ridiculous arrogant demand that God show Himself and
<a href="#Pharisees"><i>give Bill Wilson a sign</i></a>.

By the way, Bill Wilson's story about having been an intellectual non-believer was
just another one of Bill's phony pretenses,
a groundless tale that Bill fabricated to make the story of his so-called
&quot;spiritual experience&quot; sound much more dramatic and impressive.

Bill Wilson liked to brag that he had been a conservative atheist and an
&quot;icy intellectual&quot; who
had received a modern education in science and evolution at a wonderful
engineering college, and then Bill was supposedly converted into a
faithful true believer by an amazing holy vision and a dramatic religious experience.
<p>

Then, in 1938, Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that he was not
an atheist, and had never been an atheist &#8212; that he had always believed
in a &quot;Spirit of the Universe&quot; (page 10).

Bill Wilson was just a superstitious college flunk-out who later made up

<p>
So, according to A.A., the A.A. &quot;Higher Power&quot; tortured me with alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction for 20 years
until I lost everything and was homeless, and the A.A. &quot;Higher Power&quot; did it so that I would break down and
join the right church &#8212; the A.A. religion. Only then will  &quot;Higher Power&quot; be nice to me.
That is not what Jesus taught. That is not anything like what Jesus taught.
<p>

In my 69 years of life on this planet, I have met some very cruel and unsavory characters whom I do not wish
to ever meet again.  But the A.A. &quot;God&quot; is far worse.  He isn't a &quot;Loving Being&quot;; he is more like a Demon From Hell.

<a name="speak4God"> </a>
<h2><li> Who Speaks For God</h2>
<p>

And then there is the question of who is entitled to speak for God.
Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous start off saying that you will hear
the voice of God when you practice Step Eleven:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>Step 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But then Bill Wilson declared that you weren't qualified to hear God talking
to you, and that you had to take your received occult messages to your sponsor or
other group elders, and let them interpret the 'words of God' for you, and
tell you what God really meant:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbo
ok">
If all our lives we had more or less fooled ourselves, how could we
now be so sure that we weren't still self-deceived?
How could we be certain we had made a true catalog of our
defects and had really admitted them, even to ourselves?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... what comes to us alone may be garbled by our
own rationalization and wishful thinking.
The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get
his direct comment and counsel on our situation, and there can
be no doubt in our minds what that advice is.
Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
How many times have we
heard well-intentioned people claim the guidance of God when it
was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken?
Lacking both practice and humility, they had deluded themselves
and were able to justify the most arrant nonsense
on the ground that this was what God had told them.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Surely then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 59-60.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is grossly heretical for Bill Wilson to imply that the A.A. sponsors get to speak
for God.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
How and when did the sponsors and other group elders become entitled to
interpret God's messages, and privileged to speak for God?<br>
<li>
What seminary or church trained and ordained them as priests and ministers, and made them
qualified to interpret the words of God for other people?<br>
<li>
How do many years of drinking too much alcohol, plus a few years of Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings, make men into good theologians and wise spiritual advisors?
</ul>
<p>
How does Alcoholics Anonymous rationalize arrogating the job of priests and ministers?

<p>
The same problem is present in the A.A. &quot;Tradition Two&quot;, where 
God supposedly speaks through the A.A. members:
<p>
<blockquote> 
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For our group purpose, there is but one
ultimate authority &#8212; a loving God as he may express Himself in our
group conscience.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>But <i>who</i> decides <i>what</i> God is expressing in the group
conscience?</b><br>
</font>

Obviously, it is the leaders, the old-timers who are the most-indoctrinated
true believers, and who dominate the &quot;sharing&quot; sessions with
their well-practiced raps and their standard sermons.<br>
<p>
So when did they study theology in a seminary, and learn to speak for God?

<a name="24hours"> </a>
<h2><li> Miracles Wear Off After 24 Hours</h2>
<p>
Another problem with Bill Wilson's understanding of miracles is his
declarations that God's miracles wear off after 24 hours, and that alcoholics
must beg God for another miracle every day:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve
contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day
is a day when we must carry the vision of
God's will into all of our daily activities.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


<font color="black">
When Jesus Christ healed people and made the blind see and the cripples
walk, Jesus didn't say that the healing would only last for one day and
then it would wear off, so all of those people had to <i>&quot;Keep Coming
Back!&quot;</i> for another treatment every day...
<p>
Jesus also never said that the healings would be revoked if people didn't
<i>&quot;Seek and Do the Will of God&quot;</i> every day.
<p>
Jesus also never said that the healings would be revoked if people didn't
go to a meeting at the Temple at least once a week.
<p>
Jesus never told Lazarus that he would go back to being dead if he didn't
please God all of the time.
<p>
And Jesus never said that you can't quit drinking unless you &quot;carry the vision of
God's will into all of your daily activities.&quot;
<br>
<font color="blue">
(Besides which, just what is &quot;the vision of God's will&quot;?
That is just another one of Bill Wilson's grandiose platitudes.)

<h2><li> Praying in Public</h2>
<p>

While we are talking about people praying for miracles, we shouldn't overlook
Christ's admonition of those who pray in public (like at A.A. meetings and
A.A. conventions):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love
to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they
may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy
door, pray to the Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret
shall reward thee openly.<br>

<a name="let_go_and_let_God"> </a>
<h2><li> Let Go and Let God</h2>
<p>

<p>
<i>&quot;Let Go and Let God&quot;</i>
is one of the most popular A.A. slogans. That is suggested as the solution to numerous problems.
It sounds very religious or spiritual, but it isn't either.
It is lazy, superstitious, mindless, and heretical.
Someone might as well incant, &quot;Let Go and Let Santa Claus.&quot;

<p> 
Jesus Christ never taught people to live passive lives of
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let Go and Let God.&quot;
</font>
Jesus never told people to sit on
their duffs and wait for God to do things for them.
Jesus always talked about people <i>doing things for themselves</i>,
and actively doing good.
Christ said that good people should feed the hungry, and clothe the naked, and give money to the poor.

<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let Go and Let God&quot;
</font>
is just another bit of A.A. heresy.
<p>
<blockquote>
We are God's eyes in this world; it is our duty to see what needs to be done.<br>
We are God's hands in this world; it is our duty to do what needs to be done.
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let Go and Let God&quot;
</font>
will guarantee that God's work doesn't get done in this world.
Everybody who follows that slogan will be sitting on his hands and waiting for God or somebody else to do the right thing.
Nobody will be doing God's work.
<p>
 When you think about it, &quot;Let Go and Let God&quot;
could be one of the core teachings of the Satanic Church. It is one of the most pernicious teachings that A.A. espouses, one that
guarantees that God's work will not get done in this world.

<h2><li> Doing Nothing for Others</h2>
<p>
Speaking of &quot;Letting go and letting God&quot;, and the Al-Anon idea of
&quot;doing nothing about my problems&quot;,
A.A. also does nothing to help anyone else with their problems.
<p>
Jesus Christ repeatedly instructed people to feed the hungry, clothe the naked
children, and help the poor. Buddha and Mohammed taught similar things.

But Bill Wilson taught the exact opposite.  Bill said that we must not
be of service to other people, not even to alcoholics:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 98.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
And what the heck does that mean? Rely upon God? Are the poor and homeless
 supposed to sit on the street corner, waiting for God to
materialize in a burning bush and give them food and clothes and money? How does &quot;God&quot;
help the alcoholics when no human will help them?
<p>
And which &quot;G.O.D.&quot; is Bill talking about there? Doorknob Almighty? Baal Bedpan? Rock? Mountain? Group Of Drunks?
How could the G.O.D. who equals a Group Of Drunks help the alcoholics when Bill Wilson instructed the A.A.
members not to help the alcoholics?
</i></font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So Bill Wilson taught that we should not help the poor or the alcoholics,
 and we should not perform any services for them.
Bill said that <a href="orange-rroot930.html#Tod_Sloan" target="_blank">they must learn to rely on God</a>.
<p>
And A.A. lives by those instructions today. Alcoholics Anonymous <i>never</i> engages in
any kind of charity work or social work to help the poor or the homeless,
even though many of those people are poor and homeless because they are alcoholics.
<p>
The <b><i>only</i></b> way that A.A. wants to &quot;help&quot; anyone is to convert them to the 12-Step
religion:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery.
A kindly act once in a while isn't enough.
You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be.

<a name="powerless"> </a>
<h2><li> Powerless</h2>
<p>
Imagine someone going to confession, and saying to the priest,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been six
months since my last confession. I've done all kinds of things
since then, but none of them is my fault.
I am powerless over everything, and I have no control
over my actions. I turned my will
and my life over to the care of God quite some time ago, and now
God controls everything, and
anything I do wrong is God's fault. If I do something good, it
is because God makes me do it, so
I can't accept any praise. If I do something bad, it is because
God makes me do it, so I can't
accept any blame.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The priest isn't going to accept that cop-out for a minute.

<p>
And what if that person continues with his confession,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I have been defeated by sin, and
have no power over it. That is why I gave my will and my life to
God, so that He can do something about it. God is the only hope I
have of not being destroyed by sin. So all I can do is
<i>Let Go and Let God.</i>&quot;
</font>

<p>
The priest isn't going to accept that one either. The
priest will tell that person to get off of
his lazy ass, and quit feeling sorry for himself, and get to work
at fixing himself and battling sin.
And the last thing the priest will say is,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Nobody is powerless. You can resist temptation, so do it.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The priest is right, and he clearly sees what could come of
this nonsense: Imagine a horny teenager who says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am powerless over my sexual urges. I
am driven to have sex all of the
time. I can't keep my hands off of the girls. So I joined
Sexaholics Anonymous, and turned my
will and my life over to the care of God, and humbly asked Him to
remove my shortcomings.
<font size="-1" color="#9F0000">[Long-comings?]</font>
Well, He hasn't gotten around to doing it yet, so I just can't help but
gleefully jump on all of the pretty girls,
day and night, night and day,
until God gets around to fixing me. It isn't my
fault. It's all God's fault, because He isn't doing His job.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Logically, the kid has a point, if we believe in the
Twelve-Step bull droppings:
<ul>
<li> Step one
says, &quot;We admitted that we were powerless over
alcohol.&quot; (Or, &quot;powerless over our sexual urges.&quot;)
<li> Step two says, &quot;We came to believe
that only a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to
sanity.&quot;
<li> Step three says we &quot;turn our
wills and our lives over to the care of God&quot;.
<li> Step seven
says, &quot;We humbly asked God to remove
our shortcomings.&quot;
</ul>
So there it is: You are powerless and
insane, so, like some hopelessly drunk person, you hand over the car keys to
a friend and let him drive;
you let God take the steering wheel of your life and do the driving.
God gets the credit or blame for what happens next.<br>
Now, your friend is responsible for whether the car crashes or not.<br>
Now, God is responsible for whether your life crashes or not.<br>
You don't have to do a thing anymore.<br>
&quot;Let Go and Let God&quot; is a very popular A.A. slogan.

<p>
All Christian religions emphasize the idea that you are
responsible for your own actions.
And so do Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism (more properly
called Vedantic religions).
And so do Native American religions. I just can't think of
another religion, anywhere in this
world, besides Alcoholics Anonymous (and its parent,
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Buchmanism, a.k.a. The Oxford Group
Movement</a>, a.k.a. Moral Re-Armament, a.k.a.
<a href="orange-rroot750.html" target="_blank">Initiatives Of Change</a>),
that pushes the idea of you not controlling yourself, of you
not controlling your drinking, of you not being responsible for
your own actions, of you being
powerless over any temptation or vice, and of you not ever being
able to change that.

<p>
In truth, even A.A. is confused on this issue:
<ul>
<li> Step one clearly, unequivocally, declares that
we are powerless over alcohol.
<li> Step two clearly, unequivocally,
says that we believe that only
&quot;a Power greater than ourselves&quot; (God) can restore us to sanity.
<li> Step three clearly, unequivocally,
says that we are turning our wills
and our lives over to the care of God.
</ul>
A.A. members surrender control of their wills and their lives to
God, because, they say, they
have already tried running their own lives, and have failed, and
will die unless God takes over and
runs the show. And when a member does something good, the
standard line is to say, &quot;But I can't
take any credit for that, God gets the credit, because that is
Who is running the show now.&quot;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As an insurance against &quot;big-shot-ism&quot;, we can often
check ourselves by remembering that we are today sober only by
the grace of God and that any success we may be having is far
more His success than ours.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, Page 92.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="Gnostic"> </a>
When someone stays sober for a year or more, all of the members
celebrate and thank and praise
God for performing that Miracle. But when an A.A. member does
something bad, like relapse, the
member gets the blame. Suddenly everybody forgets about God, and
whether He was running the show.
<p>

That is not logically consistent, to put it mildly. I can
just see Mr. Spock of Startrek saying,
<font color="blue">
&quot;That is not logical. Whatever the causal agent is,
it is responsible for both its meritorious
actions and its reprehensible actions. And the most likely
causal agent is the A.A. member himself.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The A.A. theologians try to dodge the inconsistency by
declaring that some people have
really turned their lives over to God, and some people haven't.
Some are holding back a little, and
keeping a little of their ego still &quot;inflated&quot;. And when those
people do their own will, rather than
the Will of God, then that is when they get into trouble.

<p>
That is a rather depressing view of the human race.
People's wishes are always bad?
Anyone who does what he wishes to do will always do evil? Is it
evil to wish that your child gets
to eat? Is it evil to willfully insist that your family and
friends not suffer harm?
<p>
(That is what is called a
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Gnostic_heresy" target="_blank">Gnostic heresy</a>
&#8212; and it is
also <i>Manichaean</i> &#8212; the doctrine that all goodness is in Heaven,
and this material world and all of the people in it are all evil &#8212;
matter and flesh are in the realm of darkness &#8212; this world, the 
Earth, is the realm of Satan. Buchmanism is loaded with that particular
heresy.)

<p>
Common sense tells us that the vast majority of Americans
are not members of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Neither have the vast majority of Americans surrendered their
wills and their lives to God, in the
style of A.A.. Most people still have their own egos, their own
wills, and their own desires.
Nevertheless, most people do good things every day. Most people
do almost nothing but good,
every day. Thus, the inherent true nature of people must be
mostly good. Certainly not all good,
not angelic, but more good than bad. No matter how bad the world
looks some days, people are
still far more good than bad. Our world would self-destruct if
that were not so.

<p>
Undoubtedly, there have to be some A.A. members who have not
turned their wills or their
lives over to God; lots of them, actually. They may have thought
about it, but not quite gotten
around to doing it. Or they may have discovered the truth: that
it is <b><i>extremely</i></b>
difficult to do, almost impossible to really do. That <i>the
only people who have really shed
their egos and their desires and totally surrendered to God are
saints, real genuine
saints</i>, and those things are as rare as hen's teeth.
So rare, in fact, that we are fortunate if there is just one
present on this planet at any given time.

<p>
What strikes me as one of the most tragic parts of this
whole twelve-step routine is the
hundreds of thousands of people around the world who are wasting their time
pretending that they have turned
over their wills and their lives to the care of God, or wasting
their time, and going through all
kinds of frustration, trying to hand over their wills, and
finding out that the darned things won't go
away, that they are tied to the owner as if with a rubber band,
and just snap back. And that the
harder you try to get rid of your will or your desires, the more
strongly they just come back to you.

<p>

This stuff is really old hat. Us Hippies were talking about
it back in the sixties, and it was
thousands of years old then. One of the popular Zen stories
tells of a student who had been
working for ten years to gradually rid himself of all desires.
He went to his Zen master and asked,<br>
<font color="green">
&quot;But Master, how do I get rid of my last desire &#8212;
the desire to be rid of all desires?&quot;
</font>

<p>
And the old Zen master smiled and answered,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Now you really do have a problem, don't you?&quot;
</font>

<p>
Alas, neither Frank Buchman nor Bill Wilson knew much about
Buddhism or Hinduism, or
ego loss, or human psychology, or Zen, or the whole process of
really surrendering to God, or infinity, or eternity, or your Higher Power,
or whatever you want to call it. And
neither Buchman nor Wilson had a clue about the reality that even
if you succeed in that surrendering process, that it is just temporary,
and you will return to normal reality again all too
soon, like in just a few minutes; that only a few rare souls can
stay out there for any length of
time at all. (Bill Wilson should have known, because
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">his own drug-induced
religious experience</a> only lasted for a few minutes, and then Bill
returned to
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">normal insanity</a>.)

<p>
The rest of us mere mortals are still stuck with our wills,
our lives, our egos, and our
desires. Now we might have a moment of inspiration, and do
something good while divinely
inspired, or we might just have a good moment and do something
good without God forcing us to
do it... Thus it becomes basically impossible to tell whether
the good things an A.A. member does
are due to his or her own inner goodness, and good wishes, or due
to God's goodness.

<p>
It is just goofy logic then to insist that all of the good
actions of A.A. members are done by
God, and all of the bad actions are done by the members
themselves. But if we dump that brain-damaged logic,
then we blow a huge hole in the A.A. theological
edifice. The whole game is
based on surrendering control of your life to God, and becoming a
good little robot, or a good
little puppet on a string. And being good, and staying sober, is
considered to be evidence that you
have surrendered to God, and God is keeping you out of trouble.
And the more years of sobriety
you have, the closer you are to God. Obviously.

<p>
But alas, that logic breaks down again when old-timers
relapse. I have just recently listened
to the stories of a guy who had 9 years of sobriety and then
relapsed, and a woman who had 18
years off of drugs and then relapsed. Tragic. Sad. But even
more tragic was their inability to
even understand what happened in their lives.

<p>
The guy only said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I just got stupid for a while.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The woman said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's so wonderful. Now that I have gone
out and used and come back, I know
that I don't ever have to relapse again.&quot;
</font>
And everybody cheered and clapped.

<p>
I couldn't help but
wonder,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Did you know that you had to relapse before the
last time? Were you saying to
yourself,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>'Even though I have 18 years of success, I know that I will
have to relapse at least once
more, just for the Hell of it.'</i></font> Huh? I don't think so.&quot;
</font>

<p>
They just didn't have a clue about what had
really happened, or wouldn't admit to having a clue. If that is
true, then they are sitting ducks for
another relapse, because they won't know how to prevent the
next one any more than they did the last one.

<p>
A.A. and N.A. dogma says that you just cannot stay clean and
sober for that long without
working the Twelve Steps and getting God's help. (If you could,
then who needs the Twelve
Steps or N.A. or A.A.?)
Anyone with 9 or 18 years of sobriety has obviously long
since <i>&quot;worked the Steps&quot;</i>, many,
many times over, and has turned his or her will and life over to
the care of God. Obviously, long
ago, according to standard dogma. So where did the will to
relapse suddenly come from? How
can someone without a will of his own suddenly get the will to
relapse? Inquiring minds want to
know.

<p>
Our friend Spock would say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;That is not logical.
Something without any will cannot wish
to get a will. If we assume that a rock is an inanimate object
without a will of its own, then we
can see that a rock cannot suddenly wish to learn calculus, or
wish to take a drink, or wish to get
a free will of its own. On the other hand, when a human suddenly
wishes to take a drink, and
does so, after 9 years of not drinking, then we must assume that
the human has a will of his own,
and had one even before the desire to drink came along.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Apparently, some of the A.A. faithful are capable of thinking
along these same lines, but
they seem to burn out a few critical brain cells at just the
moment when they almost hit on the truth. This text is from
a pro-A.A. web site that wishes to teach us to do the 12 steps:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<i>STEP 3: We made a decision to turn our will and our
lives over to the care of God as we understood
Him.</i> To turn my will and our life over?? This
sounded like some kind of brainwashing to me. Was A.A.
(Alcoholics Anonymous) some kind of cult? It turned out
that A.A. is not a cult. I have the right to take my will
back any time I want.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This guy just doesn't seem to be able to understand what
&quot;will&quot; means. You can't willfully
take your will back if you have no will. And you can't
&quot;want&quot; to take your will back if you have
no will. In this context, &quot;want&quot; and &quot;will&quot;
are the same thing. And to say that you have the &quot;right&quot;
to take your will back is some kind of a joke. It is like saying
that you have the &quot;right&quot; to defy
gravity. If you don't have the physical ability to levitate, then
the right to do it is useless.<br>

<font color="blue">
(And yes, of course it's a cult, and they do brainwashing.
Your first impression was correct.)
<p>
[One can only wonder whether the oldtimers were playing mind games with
the newcomer. The new guy worries about whether he has joined a cult,
so the oldtimers tell him, &quot;Don't worry. You have the right to take back your will
and your mind any time you want.&quot;]
</font>

<p>
In truth, your will is a part of your mind, and you cannot just give
your will away as if it was a coin or a token. And you <i>really</i>
can't be giving it away, and then taking it back, repeatedly, in some
kind of a neurotic dance.
<p>
Perhaps you saw the beautiful movie <i>Awakenings</i>, starring
Robin Williams. There, Robin Williams played the role of a doctor
who worked in a mental hospital with chronic post-encephalitic patients
who looked and acted like total zombies who had no will of their own.
They were basically catatonic, and sat motionless all day long, unless
the doctor stimulated them and got them to do something.
They would do whatever the doctor made them do, or urged them to do,
but they had little or no will of their own.
That part of their mind was almost a total
blank. I have never seen anyone at an A.A. meeting who looked like that,
and I doubt if anyone else has, either.
The people at A.A. meetings all have a will of their own. There isn't
a mindless zombie in the bunch.<br>
<font color="blue">
(<i>I know, I know, it's a perfect setup for a horrible
<a href="orange-jokes.html#Dr_Ngobo" target="_blank">joke</a>, but I'm going to resist the
temptation.</i><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
See? I'm not powerless over jokes.</font>)
</font>
<p>

Even if you decide that you have no will of
your own, even if you decide that you have been defeated, and
surrender to someone else, and swear that you have
no will of your own left, and have no desire except to do the dictates of
your master, then that is <i>still</i> your will. Your will is now
to be a sycophant, or a slave, or a passive dependent, and to just
get ordered around.
<p>
But, just for the sake of argument, let's continue with the crazy idea
that you can give your will away.
<p>

Logically, to take it one step further, if the man with 9 years of sobriety
had really turned his will over to God, then God must have given it back.
And the same is true of the woman with 18 years off of drugs.
So you give your will to God, and He turns around and gives it right back
to you, and also sticks you with all of your usual problems again?
That isn't how the A.A. true believers like to tell the story...

<p>
Then, to really flog this dead horse one more time, we can
ask,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Why did God choose to
give that guy his will back, after 9 years of taking care of him?
Of course God knew what would
happen. As soon as God decided to give that guy his will back,
his fate was sealed. His relapse
was as inevitable as the rising and setting of the sun. So that
was a really mean thing to do,
giving the guy his will back... Why would God do that? It
couldn't be because God was unhappy
with something he had done, because he had not done anything.
God had his will, and ran his life
for him, and made him do whatever he did.
Until, suddenly, God didn't feel like controlling him any
more. Why not?&quot;
</font>
Inquiring minds want to know.

<p>
The really bad thing about those old-timers who relapse is
that they threaten to bring the
whole logical structure down; they threaten to collapse the whole
house of cards. They are living
proof that the Twelve Steps don't really work. I mean, if the
Twelve Steps won't even save people who
have done them for 9 or 18 years, then what hope is there for the
rest of us?

<a name="loserism"> </a>
<h2><li> The Church of Loserism </h2>
<p>
The Church of Loserism
is the church where you proudly brag about what a helpless loser you are.

The Church of Loserism teaches that God will love you extra special because you are a worthless
sinful weak piece of garbage.
God doesn't like competent virtuous people who do things right &#8212; God loves the losers, and
answers their prayers and grants their wishes.
<p>

The Beatles' song <i>I'm a Loser</i> is the standard church music.
Competence, strength, intelligence, self-reliance, and self-confidence
are terrible vices and sins,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#freedom2think" target="_blank">immoral mistakes to be avoided
at all costs</a>,
while incompetence, stupidity, ignorance, irrationalty,
superstition, blind faith, dependency, weakness, powerlessness, and insanity
are virtues to be proudly &quot;admitted&quot; at church get-togethers.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are powerless over everything,&quot;<br>
&quot;You can't do it without your support group,&quot;<br>
</font>
and<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You can't handle life without having keepers to tell you what
to do&quot;,<br>
</font>
are the sacred teachings of the church.
</blockquote>
<p>

<font color="blue">
Obviously, the teachings of the Church of Loserism contradict the teachings of every major
religion in the world. All of the mainstream religions teach people to get a grip and live good
lives and do things right.
<p>
In addition, spending years moaning and groaning and confessing what a sinful
loser you are is very harmful psychologically.
You will turn into what you keep on saying you are.

<a name="no_mistakes"> </a>
<h2><li> No Mistakes, No Accidents</h2>
<p>
The A.A. <i>Big Book</i> gives us the following religious teaching:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And acceptance is the answer to <i>all</i> my problems today.
When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing,
or situation &#8212; some fact of my life &#8212; unacceptable to me,
and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing,
or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this
moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God's world by mistake.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
3rd Edition, <i>Doctor, Alcoholic, Addict</i>, page 449.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

If nothing happens in this world by mistake,
if everything is just &quot;exactly the way it is supposed to be at this
moment&quot;,
then we have no free will and no individual responsibility for our actions.
We are just robots or puppets, being manipulated by God and being made
to do His Will. We have to be, because
everything that happens, including what we do, is just the Will of God.
So we cannot possibly have any choice in the matter, or else something that we do
could be a &quot;mistake&quot;.
<p>
<font color="#5f008f"><i>
If we do something good, it was just what God wanted to happen.<br>
If we do something that is low and vile and evil, it was just what God wanted to happen.<br>
It's all just part of God's Great Plan.<br>
</i></font>

<p>
You and I cannot possible do something wrong, because
if we did, then that would invalidate the above statement &#8212; it would be
something that God did not want to happen, and there would be something
in this world that was not
&quot;exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment.&quot;

<p>
But the logical conclusion of such a doctrine is absurd:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
If someone chooses to go rape and murder a pretty girl, hey! &#8212; that was
not a mistake &#8212; that was just the will of God.
We might as well just accept it and be serene and grateful about it because
<i>&quot;Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God's world by mistake.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
Such a doctrine is obviously grossly heretical. Most all of the major
religions of the world teach the concepts of free will and individual
responsibility. They tell you to get a grip and manage your own life
and do good works.
They don't let you just bliss out and mindlessly proclaim that everything
that happens is just what God wishes.

<p><br>
Incidentally, the statement that nothing happens by mistake &#8212; it's all God's Will &#8212;
also invalidates A.A. Steps Four and Five.
We cannot possibly be guilty of &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
&quot;defects of character&quot;, and &quot;sins&quot; if everything
was happening just as God wished it to.
We haven't done anything wrong &#8212; we were just doing whatever
God wished us to do. It was all just part of God's Great Plan.

<p>
So there is no point in us listing all of
our &quot;sins&quot; in Step Four, and confessing them to someone in Step Five,
because we haven't committed any. It's a contradiction in terms.
Likewise, we don't need God to remove our flaws and shortcomings in Steps Six and
Seven, because we don't have any. We are exactly what God made us to be, and who
are we to choose to change God's Great Plan?
<p>
The logical conclusion is that we should simply throw away A.A. Steps
Four through Seven, and stop wallowing in guilt.

<p><br>
The statement that nothing happens by mistake &#8212; it's all God's Will &#8212; also makes
God into a heartless monster:
<ul>
<li> The Holocaust, Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Treblinka, and all of
World War Two &#8212; that all happened because God wanted it to happen, and God wanted all
of those people to suffer and die?
<li> The Church murdered millions of girls
as witches throughout the Middle Ages because God wanted it to happen?
<li> The recent tsunami that killed more than 160,000 people from Malaysia
to Sri Lanka was also not an accident &#8212; it was God's will? God wanted
all of those poor brown-skinned people to die?
<li> And Hurricane Katrina was just God punishing the South for improper religious beliefs
and for voting for George W. Bush?<br>
<font color="blue"><i>
No, &quot;Repent America&quot; director Michael Markovitch said (31 Aug 2005) that God destroyed
New Orleans because of a gay festival that was scheduled to be held there a week later.<br>
</i></font>
<font color="#9F0000">
Wow. That's just like
<a href="orange-greatmoments.html" target="_blank">Jerry Falwell's declaration</a>
that God allowed 9-11 to happen, and God allowed the World Trade Center
to be destroyed, and God allowed thousands of innocent people to be killed,
because of <i>&quot;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists,
and the gays and the lesbians&quot;</i>.
</font>
</ul>
<p>
With a God like that, who needs a Devil?

<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
(Well fortunately for me, I don't believe that God is like that. It's just some
heartless religious nut-cases who are like that.)

<h2><li> No Salvation</h2>
<p>
Another heretical part of the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-Step religion
is the dogma that says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Once an addict, always an addict. Once an alcoholic, always an
alcoholic. Quitting isn't an option for addicts like us.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Christian religions believe that
people can be saved, that they can be salvaged or redeemed, that
they can always be made into something better.

And one way or another, the other major
religions of the world also say
essentially the same thing. They all agree that you can work on
yourself, and resist temptation,
and make yourself into a better person. Only A.A. says that there
is no hope for you, ever, that
you are powerless over your sin &#8212; alcoholism &#8212; and cannot
manage your own life, and that you
cannot ever recover, and that the only thing you can do is
essentially give up on yourself, and
hope that God takes over and does something useful with you, and
maybe makes you into something good.
So, in total despair, you turn over &#8212; surrender &#8212; control of your will and
your life to God in Step 3.

<font color="blue">
Just as a funny side note, the true believers don't seem to
notice what comes next:
Logically, there is no point in printing Steps 4 through 12,
because you don't have any will of
your own any more, not after Step 3, so you can't work the rest
of the steps. God is in control
now, and He may have you doing anything He wishes: washing dishes
in an orphanage, or going
to Disneyland, or helping a farmer in Kansas with his harvest, or
just anything. You won't do
Steps 4 through 12 unless God wants you to, and there is little
point in you doing them after God
has taken over. Those steps mostly deal with things like listing
all of your bad points, and
confessing them to God. God already knows all of that garbage,
so there is no point in wasting
your time doing that, not when you could be doing something
useful, like volunteering at a
charity. So don't print Steps 4 through 12. If God really wants
you to do them, He will tell you
what they are when you need to hear it. So did we just reduce A.A.
to a three-step program, or
what?
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
---------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
It is a standard Alcoholics Anonymous heresy to teach that
no one can resist temptation by himself. A.A. says that
you must always continue to attend meetings, and practice the
Twelve Steps, for the rest of your life,
because you are only &quot;in recovery,&quot; and can't
ever finish it, and actually get recovered, and learn to stand
on your own two feet:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Nobody ever graduates from this program, not ever&quot;</font>,
the A.A. faithful brag:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In conclusion, I can only say that whatever growth or understanding
has come to me, I have no wish to graduate. Very rarely do I miss the
meetings of my neighborhood A.A. group, and my average has never
been less than two meetings a week.<br>
... our one desire is to stay <i>in</i> A.A. ...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, Jim Burwell,
<i>The Vicious Cycle</i>, pages 249-250.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
A.A. doesn't seem able to distinguish between an unchangeable
condition, like the genes
someone inherits, and a changeable condition, like one's
behavior. I will agree that, unless genetic
engineering makes some fantastic advances real soon, I am pretty
much stuck with all of the genes
that I inherited. And at least one of them does seem to be
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">a gene for alcoholism</a>.
But after that, all bets
are off. The gene does not force me to drink. The gene changes
how my brain and body react to alcohol,
and changes how I feel when I drink it, but the gene doesn't
force me to drink. I don't have to do
it. I can quit, and I have quit. And I can recover from the
effects of having drunk too much, and
live a different life. As the Christians would say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;I can do good. I can choose good over evil. I have free will.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Those who believe that wallowing in powerlessness forever is
a good thing to do might consider this Biblical passage, John 10.33:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
They answered, &quot;We do not want to stone you because
of any good deeds, but because of your blasphemy! You are
only a man, but you are trying to make yourself a God!&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Jesus answered, &quot;It is written in your own Law that
God said, 'You are gods.' We know that what the scripture
says is true forever; and God called these people gods,
the people to whom the message was given.&quot;
</font></blockquote>
<p>
Somehow, I get the impression that &quot;knowing your
place&quot;, and staying in your place, isn't
quite what Jesus believed in. How do you read that? Jesus also
used the phrase &quot;children of
God&quot; more than once, as in, &quot;Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be known as the children
of God.&quot; What do children of God grow up to be? I don't
think that &quot;Bigger children of God&quot; is
the entire answer.
<p>
Here, we might also consider this statement by St. Paul in his letter to the Romans:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
For you did not receive the spirit of slavery, but you have received
the spirit of sonship.<br>

Bill Wilson was inconsistent on the issue of &quot;Once an addict, always

<p>
The idea of sudden, dramatic attainment of perfection is tempting, but
heretical (as well as impossible). Christianity and all of the other major religions of the world
teach us that love takes a lifetime &#8212; that spiritual attainment is
a slow, life-long process of &quot;Progress, not instant
perfection&quot; &#8212; and you don't just suddenly attain Heaven on Earth,
or get instantly rocketed into the fourth dimension.
Life just isn't that easy.

For &#8212; to sum up the main criticisms &#8212; MRA is irrational in its mystique

with insufficient discrimination
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_end_justifies" target="_blank">the dangerous, and often deadly,
doctrine that the end justifies the means</a>; and, by seeming to proclaim
the possibility of instant perfection, it raises hopes that cannot be

Bill Wilson taught the A.A. recruiters to hide the true nature of Alcoholics Anonymous

In his history of Alcoholics Anonymous, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
Bill Wilson described how he practiced deceptive recruiting
for his cult religion, rationalizing that he had to do it
because alcoholics are so bad:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only
little by little. They simply did not want to get &quot;too good
too soon.&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank">
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts</a> &#8212; absolute
purity, absolute honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212;
were frequently too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed
with teaspoons rather than by buckets.<br>
<!------------
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>

<a name="childhood"> </a>
<a name="inherited_sin"> </a>
<h2><li> Inherited Sin</h2>
<p>
Yet another heresy in the Alcoholics Anonymous dogma is the
concept of inherited sin.
That is an old idea, one that the ancient Jews believed in.
Jesus Christ was asked whether a man
who was born blind was blind due to his own sin, or the sin of
his parents. Essentially, Jesus said,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Neither. We aren't playing that game any more.
Paradigm shift time.
He is blind for the greater glory of God.&quot;
</font>
And then Jesus healed the blind guy.
(John 9:1)

<p>
But A.A. still believes in inherited sin. An alcoholic is
born with the gene for alcoholism, so
he is born with the spiritual disease (read: &quot;sin&quot;) of
alcoholism. He is guilty and damned and
condemned to Hell the instant the sperm hits the egg. And the
only salvation available to him is
to accept A.A. and the Twelve-Step program with its Higher Power as
his savior.

<p>
This effectively makes Alcoholics Anonymous one of the strangest
deviant sects of Calvinism around: They believe in predestination
with a nasty genetic twist.

<p>
Occasionally, at
some meeting, one of the faithful will entertain you with stories
of how he was an alcoholic and
dysfunctional, even as a child, even before he took his first
drink. (I wish I were making this stuff up, but I'm not.) And
he wasn't talking about
codependency, or being an ACOA &#8212; adult child of alcoholics. He
wasn't talking about having
been made maladjusted or neurotic by an out-of-control
alcoholic parent (although he might well have been). He
was talking about being a
dysfunctional person, an alcoholic, because he was born one. He
was talking about having been
born with a hereditary &quot;spiritual disease&quot; and having
acted wrong since birth.

<p>
One story in the <i>Big Book</i> begins:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
My alcoholic problem began long before I drank.
My personality, from the time I can remember anything, was the
perfect set-up for an alcoholic career.
I was always at odds with the entire world, not to say the
universe.
I was out of step with life, with my family, with people in general.<br>
&nbsp; ... <br>
There was no material or external reason for this.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
<i>Stars Don't Fall</i>, page 400.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

In the <i>Big Book</i>, Doctor Bob</a>, the co-founder of A.A.,
described his alcoholism this way:

Unfortunately for me I was the only child, which perhaps engendered the
selfishness which played such an important part in bringing on my
alcoholism. &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
After high school came four years in one of the best colleges in the
country where drinking seemed to be a major extra-curricular activity.
Almost everyone seemed to do it. I did it more and more, and had lots of
fun without much grief, either physical or financial.
I seemed to be able to snap back the next morning better than
most of my fellow drinkers, who were cursed (or perhaps blessed) with
a great deal of morning-after nausea. Never once in my life have I had
a headache, which fact leads me to believe that I was an alcoholic
almost from the start.
My whole life seemed to be centered around doing what I wanted to do,
without regard for the rights, wishes, or privileges of anyone else;
a state of mind which became more and more predominant as the years
passed.
I was graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in the eyes of the drinking
fraternity, but not in the eyes of the Dean.<br>

So, he was a born alcoholic, and his alcoholism was caused by
in-born selfishness.
<p>

The idea of that some people are &quot;born the wrong way&quot; is
repeated at the start of every Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting. The A.A. members begin every meeting by reading out loud
Bill Wilson's declarations in the <i>Big Book</i> that the people for whom the
A.A. program did not work were &quot;constitutionally dishonest with themselves&quot; and &quot;born that way&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed
our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or
will not completely give themselves to this simple program,
usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of
being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates.
They are not at fault;
<font color="#9F0000"><b>they seem to have been born that way.</b></font>
They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner
of living which demands rigorous honesty.<br>

Many other people report the same kind of nonsense:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Now, a person who has never had a drink, or never
drank problematically, would never be called &quot;alcohol dependent&quot;
&#8212; but you frequently find such people in AA meetings, saying that they
&quot;identify as 'alcoholics'&quot;, because they &quot;have the character
defects of alcoholics&quot; or some such. There have even been reports
of people calling their PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN &quot;alcoholics&quot;, because
they display &quot;self-centeredness&quot;! This rubbish is only possible
in a world where &quot;alcoholism&quot; has a mystical,
&quot;spiritual&quot; meaning that has nothing to do with alcohol.
And it also explains why
many people are suggesting that EVERYONE should be in a 12-Step program,
whether or not they have any substance abuse problem.
<p>
&quot;Alcoholism&quot; = gambling = &quot;sex addiction&quot; =
messiness = being married to someone who has any problem, etc. They
are all the same &quot;spiritual disease&quot;, all must be
&quot;arrested&quot; by steppism.<br>
&#8212; Rita<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And more:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many of the people in the program who
were parents would accuse their young children or teenagers of
acting &quot;alcoholically&quot; when they were disobedient or acted
selfishly. Some of the members' young kids actually believed that
they were alkies or addicts even though they had never even nipped
off of someone's beer or smoked a joint. It was sad to see children
brainwashed by this nonsense. One boy would come up for chips and
yearly medallions stating his &quot;clean time&quot; even though he had never
used drugs. This mother's middle daughter did the same thing at the
AA meeting and this kid never drank. The boy ended up being a
problem in his young adult years and the NA/AA father banned the kid
from the home. The youngster was once a good boy. Could it be that
years of hearing this bull$hit of how he was an &quot;addict&quot; during his
formative years led him to believe that he was worthless and would
never amount to much unless he continued to go to these meetings with
his dad?<br>

<h2><li> Abandoning the Bible</h2>
<p>
One problem that any Christian will have with Alcoholics
Anonymous is the organization's
abandoning of the Bible. The <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics
Anonymous</i>, is their new Bible. Some
members claim to still use the Bible; I sometimes hear a bit of
lip service to the Bible like, &quot;Keep
the <i>Big Book</i> next to the Good Book,&quot; but you won't see a
Bible at a meeting, and you won't hear
it quoted. Everybody is carrying the <i>Big Book</i>, and all readings
come from it, or from a similar
book of daily meditations, also written by Bill Wilson and
other members of A.A..
<p>
In fact, reading aloud from the Bible at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings is usually forbidden.
The Bible is considered &quot;outside literature&quot;. Reading aloud at meetings
from anything but A.A. &quot;Council Approved&quot; (and A.A.-published) literature is forbidden.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">

<a name="abandoning_Jesus"> </a>
<h2><li> Abandoning Jesus</h2>
<p>
A.A. has essentially abandoned Jesus Christ.  The A.A. faithful believe that Bill
Wilson is superior to Jesus Christ when it comes to dealing with alcoholism, and
you will hear Bill Wilson quoted a hundred times more often than Jesus Christ.
As a matter of fact, I can't really remember the last time I heard Jesus Christ
quoted in an A.A. or N.A. meeting... Again, the Christian Bible is not
&quot;council-approved literature&quot;.

<p>
The third edition of the A.A. <i>Big Book</i> does not contain the word
&quot;Jesus&quot; anywhere,
not even once. Bill Wilson raved constantly about &quot;God&quot;, but
didn't talk about Jesus Christ at all.
There is one and only one mention of &quot;Christ&quot; in the entire book, and
it is Bill Wilson's statement that before his hallucinatory experience on
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna</a>, his
so-called
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">spiritual
experience</a>,&quot; he didn't have much use for Christ:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
With ministers, and the world's religions, I parted right there.
When they talked of a God personal to me, who was love, superhuman
strength and direction, I became irritated and my mind snapped shut
against such a theory. To Christ I conceded the certainty of a great
man, not too closely followed by those who claimed Him.
His moral teaching &#8212; most excellent. For myself, I had adopted
those parts which seemed convenient and not too difficult; the rest I
disregarded.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
chapter 1, <i>Bill's Story</i>, pages 10-11.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Apparently, Bill continued to disregard a lot of that stuff even after he
&quot;saw the light,&quot; or saw
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#aacoa_experience" target="_blank">the God of
the preachers</a>&quot;,
because Bill never mentioned Jesus or Christ again, not
anywhere in the <i>Big Book</i>, not ever.
<p>
The first edition of the <i>Big Book</i> contained one story,
&quot;My Wife and I,&quot; that contained a line mentioning Jesus Christ:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here were these men who visited me and they, like myself, had
tried everything else and although it was plain to be seen none
of them were perfect, they were living proof that the sincere
attempt to follow the cardinal teaching of Jesus Christ was
keeping them sober.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That story was dropped from the second, third, and fourth editions.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
The word &quot;God&quot; appears in the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i>
(which William G. Wilson either wrote, co-authored, or edited) 106 times,
<li>
the word &quot;Power&quot;, as in &quot;Higher Power&quot; or
&quot;that Power, which is God&quot; appears 22 times,
<li>
the divine &quot;Him&quot; appears 26 times,
<li>
and the divine &quot;His&quot;
is used 15 times,
<li>
but <i>there is no mention of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, not one single mention.</i>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="Playfair_antiChristian"> </a>
William Playfair observed,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In fact, the most striking evidence of the non-Christian nature of AA is in the
testimonials of its members. In <i>Came to Believe</i>, which we are told is
a record of &quot;the spiritual adventure of AA as experienced by individual
members,&quot; not one single testimonial out of the several hundreds could
clearly and unquestionably be considered Christian. Not one single reference
to the God and Father of Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ, as the one and only Savior,
can be found. This is especially interesting when one realizes that every other
kind of testimony is recorded. Out of the millions of AA members, surely AA
could have included <i>one</i> Christian testimony in a book filled with
testimonies! If anything, this book shows an anti-Christian bias.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Members acknowledge Allah, the Life Force, any power greater than a drunk,
the AA group as a whole, etc., but never the Lord God of the Scriptures.
Either the number of Christians in AA is so small as to be negligible, or AA
editors have chosen to exclude Christian testimonies. I will leave it to the
reader to decide for himself which explanation is the correct one.<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous is not a Christian religion, no matter what
some members like to say.
<a href="orange-letters16.html#not_religious" target="_blank">It is a religion all right</a>,
in spite of the denials of the members who claim that it is only a
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">spiritual program</a>.&quot;
Alcoholics Anonymous is a Buchmanite religion.
Alcoholics Anonymous is just
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's crazy
&quot;Oxford Group / Moral Re-Armament&quot; religion</a>,
only slightly edited by William G. Wilson and Dr. Robert H. Smith.
<p>
Basically, Alcoholics Anonymous believes in and practices the teachings of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>,
another man who had little use for Jesus Christ, because he preferred his own beliefs
and teachings to those of Jesus. Bill Wilson did not invent the theology of
A.A. &#8212; he merely copied it from Frank Buchman.
<p>
In spite of that fact that Bill Wilson
tried to hide the strong connections between Frank Buchman and A.A.,
Buchman's Oxford Group got three mentions in the third edition
of the <i>Big Book</i>, while Christ
got only one. (The first two mentions of the Oxford Group are
in the Foreword to the Second Edition,
and the third is on page 218 of the third edition, in the story
&quot;He Thought He Could Drink Like A Gentleman&quot;.)

<p>
For that matter, when you consider the fact that Jesus'
first miracle was changing water into wine at a wedding party,
there might be a real problem with Jesus being a member of Alcoholics Anonymous...
(John 2:1 to 2:11.)
<p>
I am reminded of a contemporary critic of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group,
<a href="orange-Ironside.html" target="_blank">Pastor H. A. Ironside</a>,
who criticized Buchmanism by saying that it was not a Christian religion,
in spite of Buchman's claims that it was, because everything in
Buchmanism would still be possible even if Jesus Christ had never
been born. The same thing is true of Alcoholics Anonymous. A.A. would not
have to change one word of the official church dogma even if
Jesus Christ had never been born. The sacred Twelve Steps of
Bill Wilson do not mention Jesus Christ, and do not require
Jesus Christ in order to work, and the Twelve Steps don't
even require Jesus Christ to have ever existed.
<p>
Neither are the Twelve Steps based on any of the teachings of Jesus Christ.
(<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">They are based on the teachings of Dr. Frank Buchman</a>.)
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous simply has no need for, and no use for,
Jesus Christ.
A.A. worships Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob, not Jesus Christ.

WOW*  Carrying The Message.  I went to my regular Wednesday night
meeting yesterday.  Since I got to this city a year ago, the meeting
has always been run by newcomers, Salvation Army dudes and people
trying to recover in rehabs and &quot;other programs.&quot;  Before the meeting
started, I had been sharing my dismay at the fact that we never get to
hear any AA in that meeting.  When it came time for the leader to lead
the meeting and open up with a topic...he called on me instead.  YIKES!
I was already fired up, having been thinking about &quot;things&quot; all week
long.  I opened up with both barrels!  I got really passionate about
what I was saying and my voice got louder and faster, BUT...even though
there was anger in my voice...it was ALL out of our Big Book.  I shared
that I was tired of hearing everything BUT AA in this meeting, that I
didn't care WHAT OTHER PROGRAM you got here, WHAT your Higher Power's
first name is, or HOW MANY TRUE &amp; FALSE or MULTIPLE CHOICE questions
your &quot;sponsor&quot; made you FILL OUT on your 4th Step!  I also shared that
IF YOU DO WHAT WE DO...YOU JUST MIGHT GET A LITTLE SOBER TIME AROUND
HERE!  A few of the guys from the Salvation Army were laughing at me
and I suggested to them that they could laugh all they wanted.  They
could also go out and try to stay sober using just the Salvation Army
and Jesus Christ and that we would save them a seat in AA IF they make
it back!!  After all, WHY do they think those &quot;other programs&quot; send
them to AA anyway?  THIS is the easier softer way people!  If it could
have been any easier to do...Bill W. would have incorporated it into
our book!  Gratefully...a few people with quite a bit of sober time,
shared after I did.  They said the same things I did, only perhaps a
little more gently...lol.<br>

Notice the criticism of faith in Jesus Christ there. This A.A. true believer says that a 
program based on Jesus won't work, and you will be lucky to survive it. But he will save
a seat for you at the A.A. meeting, if you live long enough to make it back to a meeting.
So much for the hypocritical A.A. claims that &quot;There is no friction among us over such matters&quot;.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters198.html#horror" target="_blank">Another correspondent who went to A.A.</a> reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As soon as I divulged that &quot;The God of my understanding&quot; is God Almighty (God The
Father, God The Son, God The Holy Spirit) &#8212;
I noticed a HUGE change.  I experienced being ostrasized, I was keenly made aware
that I was the &quot;joke in the room&quot;.... people laughed when I &quot;shared&quot; anything. I saw
people in the room nodding their head, rolling their eyes at the ceiling,
snickering, putting their finger up to their nose and looking in my direction.
When I volunteered to &quot;chair a meeting&quot;... I was told I was still a newcomer and I was STRONGLY discouraged from doing that. When I did chair a meeting, an AA member sat across from me and &quot;DICTATED&quot; what I was to do... before I even started, told me what books to read out of, advised me &quot;this is how a meeting goes&quot;, and spent the rest of the time glaring at me and sitting with her arms crossed. And, um, since I'm NOT STUPID, I can recognize when someone is belittling me, putting me down, and giving me a &quot;how dare you come in here and chair a meeting and try and tell us what to do. You don't know shit, Lady.&quot; attitude. It was LOUD and CLEAR to me exactly how some members of the group felt.

In fact, Christians have often found it necessary to even start their
own recovery groups, separate from the A.A. mainstream, just to have
an emphasis on Jesus Christ:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Saddleback's 12-Step program began when [John] Baker, a recovering alcoholic
and increasingly devoted Christian, grew frustrated with the taboo of
mentioning his higher power &#8212; Jesus Christ &#8212; at traditional Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings. In the secular world, the concept of a higher power
&#8212; the cornerstone of 12-Step programs &#8212; can be anything from God to a
doorknob, depending on the spiritual comfort level of the person in
recovery.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;At an AA meeting, you can talk about anything else, but not
Jesus Christ,&quot; Baker says. &quot;I'd be mocked when I talked
about my higher power.&quot;<br>

And just recently (August 2003), the following exchanges occurred in
the Internet newsgroup
&quot;alt.recovery.addiction.alcoholism&quot; between some A.A.
true believers and me:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Mias:<br>
I thank God for A.A., and A.A. for God!<br>

<p>
Orange:<br>
Which God is it that A.A. gave you, Jesus Christ, or some other god?<br>
<hr>

<p>
Mias:<br>
On your inquiry about my God I will only say that 'God, as I understand Him'
will suffice. I will also say that that God instructs me not to judge so
that I be not judged. I better take that advice.<br>
<hr>

<p>
Orange:<br>
In other words, you refuse to answer the simple, honest
question about which god Alcoholics Anonymous gave you.
And it apparently is not Jesus Christ, or you would be
happy to say so.
<p>
One of the criticisms that a theologian had of Frank
Buchman's Oxford Group Movement was that it was not
Christian at all, in spite of Buchman's claims that it
was. The proof: that none of Buchmanism would have to
be changed in the slightest even if Jesus Christ had
never been born.
<p>
And Alcoholics Anonymous, which Bill Wilson derived from
the Oxford Group, is just the same. A.A. has no need of
Jesus Christ.<br>
<hr>
<p>
Mias:<br>
you ought to study the manual of whatever religion you prescribe to and see
if your actions fit in at all.
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_personal_attacks" target="_blank">
It is so sad that so many 'money-makers'
these days proclaim a belief system that they have not studied at all just

I did not put a 'hex' on you. You are doing it on yourself and will know
that one day.<br>
God bless you.<br>

<hr>
<p>
Orange:<br>
Hey, I'm just trying to get at the truth, which
you don't want to tell.
I have maintained for a while now that Alcoholics
Anonymous is not a Christian religion, even though
it puts on airs of being Christian.
<p>
A.A. doesn't have the honesty or the guts to tell
the pastors or priests of the churches in whose
basements A.A. meets that A.A. is really
non-Christian and has no use for Jesus Christ.
Bill Wilson has replaced Jesus in the A.A. religion.
<p>
So I'm still asking, &quot;What God or god did A.A. give you?
What is so terrible about that simple honest question?&quot;
Why won't you answer it?
<p>
Doesn't your God tell you to tell the truth? To be
rigorously honest? (Big Book, page 58.)
So let's see some of that rigorous honesty.

WEEEEEELLLLLLLL, I introduced myself and said that I did not have a problem
with the language being used in the rooms of AA. MY problem was when someone
talked about Jesus and quoted scripture from the bible in an AA meeting.
But, that was my problem. If I wanted to hear the gospel, I would go to
church. If I want to hear from people like me and what we share, I come to
AA.<br>

<h2><li> The Worship of False Saints and False Relics</h2>
<p>

Another feature of the worship of Bill Wilson is something that I would call
<i>the worship of false saints and false relics</i>.
Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob were not saints, and their former possessions are not
holy relics.
<p>
Way back in 1963,
<a href="orange-ahcain.html" target="_blank">Dr. Arthur H. Cain criticized</a>
the growing cultishness of Alcoholics Anonymous, saying:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A. as a group must recognize its real function: to serve as a bridge
from the hospital or the jail to the church &#8212; or to a sustaining
personal belief that life is worthwhile. It must not pose as a
spiritual movement that provides everything the alcoholic needs to
fulfill his destiny. It must not teach its young (as it does in
Alateen, its Sunday School for the children of alcoholics) such
catechisms as:

<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;We will always be grateful to Alateen for giving us a
way of life and a wonderful healthy program to live by and enjoy.&quot;
</font>

It must realize that &quot;the actual coffee pot Anne used to make the first
A.A. coffee (shown in &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age,&quot; Harper 1957,
a commentary on the A.A. bible, Alcoholics Anonymous, Works Publishing
Company, 1946) is not the Holy Grail. The cake and coffee served after
meetings are just refreshments, not the body and blood of Jesus Christ.<br>

<p>
Dr. Arthur Cain might have added:
<font color="blue">
&quot;And the <i>Big Book</i>, 'Alcoholics Anonymous', is not the Word of God, either.
Bill Wilson was not &quot;divinely inspired&quot; when he wrote the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>.
(He was just repeating the beliefs and practices of the Oxford Group cult religion.)
And an old-timer who is selling a copy of the <i>Big Book</i> to a newcomer is not
grandly passing on the Holy Wisdom to the younger generation, but you wouldn't know that

<a name="not_Biblical"> </a>
<h2><li> The 12 Steps Are Not Biblical, And Not Christian</h2>
<p>
<a name="Bible_based"> </a>
Speaking of abandoning the Bible, some A.A. apologists claim that the
Twelve Steps are based on the Bible.
Several books and articles have made such a claim &#8212;
the authors simply browsed the Bible and picked out some quotes that sounded
sort of like some of the Twelve Steps, and then claimed that the Steps were based on
Biblical teachings.
(It's the same process as seeing things in Rorschach ink blots &#8212; things that aren't
really there.)
They simply ignore the obvious fact that Bill Wilson's
12 steps are unquestionably just the occult practices of the fascist cult leader
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman, a man who preferred his own teachings
to those of Jesus Christ, and who claimed that any contemporary Oxford
Group member's
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank"><i>Guidance</i></a>
and revelations were
<a href="orange-rroot450.html#Shoemaker" target="_blank">just as authoritative</a>
as those in the Bible.
<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
The more faithful Christians have found it necessary to &quot;adapt&quot;
Bill Wilson's 12 steps for Christian use.
For example, Step Three:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
becomes:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our lives over to God through Jesus Christ.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="compatible"> </a>
If the Twelve Steps were really based on the Bible, then it should not be necessary
to change them and &quot;adapt&quot; them to make them acceptable to a Christian
recovery program.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The irony of a Twelve Step program customized for Christians is that many
who use it believe it is not only effective but Biblical. The author of Rapha's
program explains that:
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Swiss,SanSerif,Courier">
<i>Rapha's Twelve Step Program for Overcoming Chemical Dependency</i> is
designed ... to complement the original Biblically based Twelve Steps of
Alcoholics Anonymous.<font size="-1"><sup>8</sup></font>
</font>
</blockquote>
If the original Twelve Step program needs to be &quot;adapted&quot; for
Christians, it seems odd to say that it is &quot;Biblically based.&quot;
What kind of double talk is going on here? Unfortunately, this kind of
confusion is characteristic of the literature of &quot;Christianized&quot;
recovery programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After all is said and done, Christians do not seem to be making the recovery
industry approach more compatible with Biblical Christianity. On the contrary,
the recovery industry seems to be influencing the Christian approach.<br>

<p>
In the final analysis, any religion that tells you that you can worship a bedpan or a doorknob or
a Group Of Drunks as your &quot;god&quot; is more heretical and totemic than Christian.
And to insist that you will get a miracle by praying to such a &quot;Higher Power&quot; is more
superstitious than spiritual.
It is the worst sort of idolatry.

<p>
Some A.A. members are even more blatant about the huge gulf of incompatibility between Christianity and the 12-Step religion.
In a recent radio interview, the country singer and short-lived TV star Steve Earl declared,
&quot;I'm not a Christian, and I'm not a Moslem, and not ... a Buddhist.&quot; He went on to declare that
he practiced &quot;the 12-Step spirituality.&quot;

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="Job"> </a>
<h2><li> Job</h2>
<p>
Speaking of ignoring Jesus Christ and the New Testament of the Bible,
Alcoholics Anonymous actually also ignores the second half of the Old Testament.
A.A. is based on rather primitive ideas of God rewarding people for
being good and believing in Him.
In the earliest books of the Bible, the Israeli sheep herders and goat herders
had essentially very childish ideas of religion &#8212; <i>&quot;just be good and
believe in God and God will take care of you and make you win wars and
give you lots of sons and make everything else okay too.&quot;</i>

<p>
But then the Book of Job came along and refuted such simple-minded ideas.
In the Book of Job we learned that bad things happen to good people.
The Lord our God will not necessarily reward goodness in this lifetime.
<p>
Job was a good man who suffered immensely, and the Lord did nothing to stop
it. Job's friends taunted Job and asked him why he still believed in his God when the
Lord had obviously abandoned Job. The Book of Job answered that question with another
question: &quot;Who are you to question the motives of God?&quot;
<p>

The philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous is still stuck at a pre-Jobian stage of development.
A.A. members act like infantile narcissistic children who expect God to take care of them
and grant all of their wishes if they are good.
It is essentially just Santa Claus Spirituality &#8212;
Santa will bring the children a bunch of goodies if the children behave themselves.
The Alcoholics Anonymous Third Step specifically declares
that God will take care of you if you surrender your will and your life to God:<br>
<font color="#4f007f" size="+1">
&quot;3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Well, there is nothing in the Bible that says that God will take care
of your will and your life for you if you surrender like that.
The Book of Job says just the opposite &#8212; that God won't.

<h2><li> Spiritual, Not Religious</h2>
<p>
Let us not forget the
<i><b>&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">It's spiritual, not
religious</a>&quot;</b></i> conceit.
A.A. members like to claim that
&quot;Religion is for people who are afraid of going to Hell,
and spirituality is for people who have been there.&quot;
Which leaves the A.A. members
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#church_buildings" target="_blank">feeling superior to the
people who own the churches</a>
in whose basements A.A. meets, because the A.A. members think that they
aren't afraid of going to Hell any more, and the other people are.
<p>
That is really just an ego game of spiritual one-upmanship.
<p>
Likewise, A.A. members imagine that A.A. is superior to the other religions
because Alcoholics Anonymous is supposedly more open-minded and liberal
about religious and spiritual matters.
(Actually, it isn't.  The &quot;great spiritual freedom&quot; is just
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod" target="_blank">a bait-and-switch trick</a> to mollify the newcomers.
You really have to believe in the A.A. version
of God &#8212; a tyrannical order-dictating wishing-granting micro-managing patriarch &#8212;
for the 12 Steps to actually work.)

<p>
Which in turn is another point of conceit: A.A. members feel that A.A. is superior
to a religion, because a religion is just a bunch of people who meet in a church,
while &quot;spirituality is everywhere...&quot;
(The A.A. members somehow overlook the small detail that they meet in the
very same building as the church members.)

<h2><li> Ordained Clergy</h2>
<p>
And then there is the issue of ordained clergy. Both Alcoholics Anonymous
and its theological predecessor, Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Groups&quot;
(a.k.a. &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;),
had a bad habit of arrogantly declaring that their own members were better
theologians and better counselors than ordained priests and ministers.
<p>
The Alcoholics Anonymous <i>Big Book</i> printed one story where a newcomer
who had read
the previous edition of the <i>Big Book</i> enthusiastically declared that
he was better at curing alcoholism
than anybody else:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here was a book that said that I could do something that all
these doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd
been going to for years couldn't do!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Geoffrey_Allen_1"> </a>
Likewise, well before that, Oxford Group members were declaring that experienced
old sinners and degenerates from the back alleys were better spiritual advisors
than ordained ministers and priests.
Rev. Geoffrey Allen was a leader and a true believer in the Oxford Group
Movement who attempted to explain and rationalize
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Geoffrey_Allen_1" target="_blank">all of the practices of the Oxford Groups</a>,
like receiving Guidance from God in s&eacute;ances
and &quot;sharing&quot; sins with others who are not ordained priests or ministers.
First, Rev. Allen explained how all members had to openly confess their sins
in Group meetings, and then he declared that the Oxford Group cult members
were better qualified to hear the confessions than ordained clergy:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Sooner or later, when we are ready to receive it, the Spirit will lead us
to a deeper sharing of all that has been weighing on us from the past.
It is a healthy practice for everyone, when they are led by God to do so,
to share to the depths whatever in the past has most burdened their memory
with thoughts of guilt. Such deep sharing may often be of things of which
it is a shame to speak in public, and it will be right to accept the guidance
of the Spirit, and to share with some older individual. Such an individual
will then stand to us as ambassador of the forgiveness of Christ. In a Church
which was fully Christian the natural person to whom to take such confession
would be the priest.
<font color="blue">
Whether in the actual Church the priest is always the
right person is questionable. He might be shocked; and that might be good
neither for him nor for us.</font>
The person who receives such confession
<font color="blue">must be someone who has learnt from his own
experience</font>, both under the Cross and
in the Christian fellowship, that the forgiveness of Christ outreaches the
furthest sin of man.
<font color="blue">
He will therefore never be shocked; before the utmost
evil he will say without blame, as Christ would say: 'Thy sins are forgiven;
go and sin no more.'</font><br>

</blockquote>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Notice how Rev. Geoffrey Allen implied that non-clergy (i.e., Oxford Group members)
were more qualified, or at least better equipped, than ordained
clergy to hear confessions, because they wouldn't be shocked by what they heard.
Allen declared that the poor innocent cloistered feeble-minded old priests
might be harmed by shocking confessions,
but some worldly, experienced old degenerates from the back alleys
could handle the job with ease.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
(Also notice how Rev. Allen used the propaganda techniques of
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;</i>
and
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Argue From Adverse Consequences</a>&quot;</i>
to suggest that priests <b><i>might be shocked</i></b> by sensational confessions, and
<b><i>that wouldn't be good for either of us</i></b>, and then
Rev. Allen simply assumed that his conjecture was true, and he
proceeded to &quot;fix the problem&quot; by having Oxford Group members
&quot;who will never be shocked&quot; hear the confessions.)

<font color="blue">
And A.A. still does that today:<br>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Only another alcoholic understands.&quot;
<li> &quot;Alcoholics have a special ability to reach another alcoholic.&quot;

<li> And again, Bill Wilson wrote that alcoholics are better counselors than
ministers or doctors:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

you can be uniquely useful to other alcoholics.<br>

The more nutty and arrogant A.A. members even go so far as to declare that they were
<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html" target="_blank">chosen by God to cure the alcoholics</a>.
They have God saying to A.A. members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'Unto your weak and feeble hands I have entrusted power beyond estimate.
To you has been given that which has been denied the most learned of your
fellows. Not to scientists or statesmen, not to wives or mothers, not even
to my priests or ministers have I given this gift of helping other alcoholics
which I entrust to you.'<br>

John C. Mellon, who is apparently an A.A. member, wrote the book &quot;Mark as Recovery Story;
alcoholism and the rhetoric of Gospel mystery&quot; (1995), where
he even suggested that Alcoholics Anonymous should be regarded as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

<p>
<li>
Rev. Allen also claimed that the spiritual counselors who heard the
confessions must be experienced sinners who have learned about the sin
<i>from their own experience</i>.<br>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
So let's see... Logically,
Catholic priests can't hear confessions about wild sexual affairs unless they have
had a few dozen themselves... Right? And murderers can only confess their sins
to another experienced murderer... Right?<br>
</i></font>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
(Oh really? Since when? Where did Rev. Allen get that? That isn't in the
Bible or any other religion's scriptures... That isn't part of the doctrines of the Catholic
Church or any other church that practices confession. Rev. Allen seems to have gotten
a lot of his theology out of thin air, or from Frank Buchman, who just made it up out of thin air.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
And likewise, it takes an experienced old alcoholic to hear confessions
(&quot;sharing&quot;) about alcoholism, right?
</font>

<p>
<a name="absolve"> </a>
<li>
Rev. Allen also claimed that unordained non-clergy (like Oxford Group members)
had the power to forgive and absolve sins in the name of Jesus Christ
&#8212; that they could
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;stand to us as ambassador of the forgiveness of Christ&quot; &#8212;
&quot;Thy sins are forgiven; go and sin no more.&quot;</i></font> &#8212;
which is a new religious doctrine that will certainly
start some interesting theological debates:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Who needs seminaries or trained clergy? Who needs ordained
ministers and priests? Some college dropouts with
a couple of months of indoctrination in cult religion should be good
enough...&quot;</i></font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>That shows typical cultish arrogance. Cult members like to claim that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">they are special</a>,
and somehow more qualified than ordinary people &#8212;
even more qualified than the experts or the professionals.</i>
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="_blank">And A.A. still does that</a>.
A.A. members are forever bragging that they are better drug and alcohol counselors than the professionals
or the doctors, and they also routinely claim that their flavor of &quot;spirituality&quot; is so much better than
the established churches.

<!----------
Like one A.A. member declared in his own <i>Big Book</i> story, after
reading Bill Wilson's bombastic bragging in
the &quot;Big Book&quot; <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>:
<P>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here was a book that said that I could do something that all
these doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd

<table width="89%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Professor George E. Vaillant, who is a member of the Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc. Board of Trustees,
put forth a similar argument while praising Alcoholics Anonymous and the religious method of treating
addiction:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...religion, in ways that we appreciate but do not understand, provides
forgiveness of sins and relief from guilt.
Unlike many intractable habits that others find merely annoying,
alcoholism inflicts enormous pain and injury on those around the alcoholic.
As a result, the alcoholic, already demoralized by his inability to stop drinking,
experiences almost insurmountable guilt from the torture he has inflicted on others.
In such an instance, absolution becomes an important part of the healing process.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>, George Vaillant, page 243.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But &quot;religion&quot; does not forgive or absolve sins, not any more than the
local Ladies Home Garden Club does. 
And a religion that declares that you can worship just any old Higher Power
&#8212; anything like a bedpan
or a doorknob or a Golden Calf &#8212; cannot claim that such idols will grant
absolution and forgiveness.
<p>
Now an ordained Priest might hear confessions and grant absolution,
but Alcoholics Anonymous cannot make that claim while it simultaneously
insists that it is not a religion and it has no ordained priests.
<p>
Oh, and the alcoholic is not
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;demoralized by his inability to stop drinking&quot;</font>.
Alcoholics are not powerless over alcohol.
Drinking alcohol is a choice.

<p>
<li>
And of course Rev. Allen would have us believe that all of the Oxford Groupers were constantly
receiving Guidance from God, Who was even telling them whether they should confess
something and to whom they should confess it. Rev. Geoffrey Allen's theology
was a radical departure from mainstream Christianity.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And A.A. still does that, too.
Such occult &quot;channelling&quot; of God was discussed
<a href="#dabble_occult">earlier</a>.
</font>

<p>
<li>
<a name="ftnt09_ret"> </a>
The mention of using laymen, rather than ordained clergy, to hear confessions
brings up another problem with the Oxford Groups. The Group members who hear
confessions
are supposed to keep such confessions confidential,
but what about the people who leave the groups? How long will they remain
silent?<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt09">9</a></sup></font>
And what about the Group members who are less than <i>Absolutely Pure</i>, and
tend to be gossips and blabber-mouths?
The Oxford Groups had just that problem &#8212; gossips who could not keep secrets.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#confidential" target="_blank">More on that here</a>.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And of course Alcoholics Anonymous has the same problem today. Anything you say in
an A.A. meeting
<a href="orange-letters14.html#blabbed" target="_blank">can become common knowledge all over town</a>
as the local gossips
have a hey-day. And your &quot;sharing&quot; can even be
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#confessional" target="_blank">used against you in a court of law</a>.
</font>
</ul>


<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="confessions"> </a>
<h2><li> Public Confessions</h2>
<p>
The A.A. &quot;sharing&quot; of public confessions in A.A. meetings is
another heretical practice.
Bill Wilson got that idea from Frank Buchman and his Oxford Groups cult.
Frank Buchman seized on a fraction of one verse in the Bible, and claimed that it warranted
the practice:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Confess <i>your</i> faults one to another and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed. The effective fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much.&quot;<br>
</font>
== James 5:16
</blockquote>

<p>
As you can see, that verse emphasized people sick praying for each other so that they may be healed, not
people constantly confessing everything to everyone forever. 
<p>
Also, that line said &quot;confess your faults <b>one to another</b>&quot;,
not one to a crowd. That line does not justify public confessions.

<p>
The very early Christian church did practice public confession, but
they learned the hard way that the practice of public confessions
in church services created all kinds of horrible problems, including
corrupting the children, and offending the older people, and people taking pride in their sins,
so they banned the practice of public confessions. (And that is still the
official policy of the Roman Catholic church today.)
<p>
<ul>
<li>
When the children hear the adults confessing all of their sinful indulgences,
some of the children think that maybe they would like to try that themselves.
<p><li>
The children will also start to think that such behavior is normal &#8212;
obviously, everybody's doing it.
<p><li>
And then some people will take pride in their sins, and brag about them,
rather than confess &#8212; declaring that their infidelities were bigger and longer than
anybody else's, and their drunken binges were bigger and longer and more outrageous
and more adventurous than anybody else's....
<p><li>
And then people will take some more pride in their salvation:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;My miraculous conversion was much bigger than yours &#8212;
I overcame far greater sins than you did &#8212;
I was <i>really</i> miraculously pulled up from the depths
(so God must really care about me).&quot;</font>

<p><li>
In addition, people will grow jaded and desensitized to the sins confessed
when they hear too much of sin.
Something about which people talk every day, and admit every day, becomes
commonplace and loses its power to shock or shame. The unthinkable becomes thinkable.
Grave sins become mundane and ordinary.

<p><li>
And then both the Oxford Groups and Alcoholics Anonymous even took confession a step further
and turned it into a stand-up comedy routine. The featured guest speaker at A.A. meetings often
recites a well-practiced humorous story of his life that keeps the audience laughing
and makes alcoholism and a life of sickness and crime and sin sound hilariously funny.

</ul>

<p>
It is a great stretch to go from that one fragment of a line that
St. James wrote to making a circus and a public spectacle out of confessions.
This is old hat &#8212; a 2000-year-old mistake.
<p>
The Oxford Group cult, from which Bill Wilson derived the practices of
Alcoholics Anonymous, had the same problems. Frank Buchman just resurrected
a very old mistake, and then Bill Wilson copied it from Frank.
<p>
Notice that the Catholic Church has people confess to an ordained Priest in private,
in sworn confidence, in a confessional, not in public.
There are a number of good reasons why the Catholic Church has a ban on public confessions.
Over the centuries, they learned the hard way what not to do.

<p>
Unfortunately, neither the Oxford Group nor Alcoholics Anonymous learned anything
from the experiences of the early Christian Church. They arrogantly assumed
that the Church had nothing to teach them, and that they knew better than the Church.
The Bishop of Durhan noticed that problem with the Oxford Group back in 1933:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Groupist ignores the history of Christianity, and regards
the system of the Church as too apparently ineffective
to command acceptance. He moves at a stride from the Age of Apostles
to the present time, and assumes that the centuries of Christian
experience have nothing to teach him. Surely this is a position
which cannot seriously be defended.<br>

<a name="receive_grace"> </a>
<h2><li> Earned Grace</h2>
<p>
Another item of Bill Wilson's heresy is this:
Christianity teaches that you receive grace from God as a gift,
and that you are not saved by good works. Bill says just the
opposite: that you get in God's good graces by doing all twelve
of Bill Wilson's Steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are sober and happy in our A.A. work. Things go well at home and
office. We naturally congratulate ourselves on what later proves to be a far
too easy and superficial point of view. We temporarily cease to grow
because we feel satisfied that there is no need for all of A.A.'s Twelve
Steps for us. We are doing fine with just a few of them. Maybe we are
doing fine with only two of them, the First Step and that part of the
Twelfth where we &quot;carry the message.&quot; In A.A. slang, that blissful
state is known as &quot;two-stepping.&quot; And it can go on for years.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The best-intentioned of us can fall for the &quot;two-step&quot; illusion.
Sooner or later the pink cloud stage wears off and things go disappointingly
dull. We begin to think that A.A. doesn't pay off after all. We become
puzzled and discouraged.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then perhaps life, as it has a way of doing, suddenly hands us a great big
lump that we can't begin to swallow, let alone digest. We fail to get a
worked-for promotion. We lose that good job. Maybe there are serious
domestic or romantic difficulties, or perhaps that boy we thought God
was looking after becomes a military casualty.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What then? Have we alcoholics in A.A. got, or can we get, the resources to
meet these calamities which come to so many?
&nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp;
Well, we surely have a chance if we switch from &quot;two-stepping&quot;
to &quot;twelve-stepping,&quot; if we are willing to receive that grace
of God which can sustain and strengthen us in any catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 112-113.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice how Bill Wilson equates the following of his dictates with
&quot;spiritual growth&quot;:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We temporarily cease to grow because we feel satisfied
that there is no need for all of A.A.'s
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill's]</font>
Twelve Steps for us.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<p>
Bill actually has the arrogance
to declare that people will not &quot;grow&quot; spiritually unless
they do what he says. (And yes, Bill is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hide" target="_blank">hiding behind other people</a>
again, by saying &quot;A.A.'s Twelve Steps&quot;, rather than
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>my</i> twelve steps, which I wrote and shoved on everybody else&quot;</font>.)
<p>
Bill says that something bad will eventually
happen in your life. I agree.
It's Murphy's Law. Something bad will always happen, eventually, sooner
or later. Somebody will get sick, or somebody will die, or somebody will suffer a major misfortune.
Bill says that you won't be able to handle it unless you do the Twelve Steps.
I disagree. There is absolutely no evidence that
the Twelve Steps make you better able to handle those nasty blows
and hard knocks that life can deliver, and Bill offers us no evidence
of that, either.
<p>

Then, in another verbal shell game, more slick double-talk, Bill
arbitrarily declares that we <i>surely have a chance</i> if we
switch to doing all twelve of Bill's <i>&quot;suggested&quot;</i> steps,
and if we <b><i>also</i></b> receive the grace of God.
Yeh, and I surely have a chance of winning the lottery, too,
if I buy a ticket. But how much of a chance?
<p>
<i>There is not necessarily <i>any</i> connection between doing
Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps, and receiving grace from God</i>,
but Bill deceptively links them together in one sentence, as if he
has a special exclusive wholesale grace distribution arrangement with God,
as if God will give you His grace only if you are willing to
do all twelve of Bill Wilson's Steps. (That is more evidence of Bill's
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">insane delusions of grandeur</a>.)

<p>
The Bible specifically teaches us that Grace is
a gift from God, and that it cannot be bought with good works, but
Bill Wilson says that you must earn Grace from God by working
Bill's program and doing all twelve of his Steps.
That is heresy.

<a name="not_saints"> </a>
<h2><li> We Are Not Saints.</h2>
<p>
One of the more disgusting aspects of Alcoholics Anonymous is their attitude towards
wrong-doing by other A.A. members. If you criticize A.A. for things like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">allowing the sexual exploitation
of young women</a>
who come to A.A. seeking help with drug or alcohol problems, the A.A.
members whine and rationalize: <i>&quot;We Are Not Saints!&quot;</i>
Bill Wilson's line on page 60 of the <i>Big Book</i> is used as an excuse for tolerating
all kinds of sins and crimes. And then they recite the slogans,
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li> <i>&quot;Don't take someone else's inventory.&quot;</i>
<li> <i>&quot;When you point a finger at someone else, there are three pointed back at you.&quot;</i>
</ul>
</font>

<p>
After listing the 12 Steps in the <i>Big Book</i>, and calling them &quot;principles&quot;,
rather than the cult religion practices that they really are, Bill Wilson declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Many of us exclaimed, &quot;What an order! I can't go through with it.&quot;
Do not be discouraged . No one among us has been able to maintain anything like
perfect adherence to these principles.
We are not saints.
The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines.
The principles we have set down are guides
to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, page 60.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, because most A.A. members do not perform the 12 Steps correctly, they claim
that it is okay to
sexually exploit underage girls in Alcoholics Anonymous and shrug it off by declaring that
&quot;We are not saints.&quot;
<p>
The same goes for financial dishonesty and any other kind of exploitation of newcomers.
<p>
And the line, &quot;Progress, Not Perfection&quot; is also used as an excuse for wrong-doing.
As if we can't expect
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Harry_K" target="_blank">Harry K.</a>
to behave properly this year; maybe he'll stop the child molesting
next year after more he makes some more &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. 

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses the &quot;We are not saints&quot;
excuse to explain away everything from
dealing drugs to other A.A. members, to helping oneself
to the collection basket, to sexually exploiting the attractive young women who
come to A.A. seeking help with a drug or alcohol problem.

<p>
<a name="sick_well"> </a>
One A.A. apologist actually argued that it was wrong to demand moral behavior from 
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html#no_rules" target="_blank">rapist A.A. Midtown Group members</a>
&#8212; to demand that the sexual predators in A.A.
stop raping the young female newcomers &#8212; because that would be
setting expectations too high:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The problem with what you are doing is that A.A. is a place for sick people
to get well. For alcoholics to come recover. It is not a place for nice
kind folk to become saints.

<p>
If you start making behavior rules, which is in essence exactly what you
are trying to do, where does it end? Do you really think people are
trying to condone illicit behavior?

<p> 
No, that is not what people are saying. What they are saying is that
&quot;no matter how far down the scale&quot; you have gone, you are
welcome in A.A. If you don't change, well, you won't stick around.
You are welcome to come, but why would you? A.A. is for the sick trying
to get well, and if you aren't interested in getting well, you won't be
around long. That is why the traditions state 'there is no A.A. police'.
Get it? That is why A.A. members &#8212; and I live in PA &#8212; have a hard time
listening to you.

<p>
If you start trying to make a list of unacceptable behavior, you are
essentially making a list of rules for membership, of which there aren't
any and hopefully never will be. I fail to see how you can not comprehend
this. Our fellowship can not deny even the most unsavory of individuals.
Even in the midst of their lowest points, they are welcome.

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="black">
The writer argues that <font color="#4f007f">&quot;If you don't change, you won't be around long.&quot;</font>
That isn't true at all. The thieves and rapists in
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the Midtown Group</a>
have been around for 20
years, and they show no signs of going away. Why would they quit A.A. when they get money,
power, and sex from running a cult?
<p>
This A.A. apologist is actually
trying to argue that there are no rules in Alcoholics Anonymous, and that it is
against &quot;The Traditions&quot; to demand that people behave in a moral manner.
Well, the A.A. &quot;Third Tradition&quot; says,
<p>
<center>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.
</font>
</center>

<p>
The &quot;A.A. 12 Traditions&quot; <i>do not</i> say that the only RULE
that A.A. members must follow is &quot;a desire to quit drinking&quot;.
There are still other rules that are expected of all people: don't rape,
don't rob, don't murder...
A.A. does not get to suspend those rules because &quot;We are not saints&quot;.
<p>
You know, it takes an incredible amount of arrogance and gall for A.A. members
to declare that we cannot impose any rules on them &#8212; rules like &quot;don't rape&quot;
&#8212; because they are busy recovering from drinking too much alcohol.

<h2><li> Causation and Control</h2>
<p>

Both the <i>Big Book</i> and members sharing in meetings say things like:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have no other explanation for the many good things that have
happened to me since I have been in A.A. &#8212; they came to me
from a Greater Power.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>,
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, 3rd Edition, page 367.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The A.A. members don't seem to realize it,
but every time one of them &quot;shares&quot; the sentiment that
they are feeling so grateful because their Higher Power rigged events
to make things turn out so good for them, they open up an
incredibly nasty can of worms.
<p>
When I hear one of them yammering mindlessly like that, I always want to ask,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Since your Higher Power is controlling
every little detail of this world, and making things
so good for you, I have to ask, why did
your Higher Power start the War in Vietnam? Three or four million innocent
people were killed over there, besides making all of the guys of my
generation very unhappy. And then the war spread to Cambodia, and
another two million people got killed there.
<p>
And then there was that nasty slaughter in Rwanda, with the Hutus
killing the Tutsis by the hundreds of thousands, usually by hacking them
to pieces with machetes.
<p>
And those are just the first couple of items that
come to mind, right off the top of my head, from my own memory.
<p>
And then there was Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald, and the whole
Holocaust...
<p>
And then there were Stalin's purges...
<p>
And that's just a small part of what has gone on in this century alone.
I could go on and on with the slaughter of Tibetans by the Chinese,
the Armenians by the Turks,
the Guatemalan Indians (native peoples) by the Spanish landlords,
the slaughter of Chinese and Koreans and Philippinos and everybody else by the Japanese in World War II...
<p>
And to really bring things up to date, about <i>sixty thousand</i>
people starved to death today, here on this planet Earth, and more than half
of them were children. That's who starves. The children.
And 60,000 people starve to death <i>every day</i> here.
There were 60,000 today, and 60,000 yesterday, and 60,000 the day before
that. And there will be 60,000 tomorrow, and the next day, and the next...
<p>
And then, just to put the frosting on the cake, Africa is
being decimated by a plague of AIDS, where poor people are dying by
the millions, without any hope of getting medicines, no hope whatsoever,
because the medicines are simply impossibly expensive.
<p>
And what AIDS won't do to Africa, Ebola will.

<p>
I'd really like to know why your Higher Power did all of that to other people,
while He was busy making you so happy with your new car, and your job,
and your house...&quot;

<p>
This is nothing new.
Theologians have been debating this question for thousands of years.
And Bill Wilson mentioned it himself in the <i>Big Book</i>,
in explaining why he didn't like religions:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery that religious
dispute had facilitated, made me sick. I honestly doubted whether, on
balance, the religions of mankind had done any good. Judging from what
I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human affairs was
negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest. If there was a Devil,
he seemed the Boss Universal, and he certainly had me.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 1, <i>Bill's Story</i>, page 11.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, Bill never returned to this issue. After he flipped out
on Charles Towns' quack
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">belladonna
cure</a>&quot; and saw
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#preachers">The
God of the Preachers</a>&quot;,
Bill just declared that having a special relationship with God was
wonderful, and the only way to live, and that everybody ought to do it.
Bill just blissed out, and mindlessly ignored this issue forevermore,
and never answered his own question.

<p>
Other theologians have not been so blind, or so giddy.
They have debated the question endlessly.
And they keep coming up with the same
problem: If you believe in a God who can and does control every
little detail of this world, then God is responsible for all of the
bad stuff that happens, as well as all of the good stuff.
<p>
Some religions can deal with this. Hinduism has many gods, and
some of them are evil or demonic. Kali and Shiva come to mind as
two of the Destroyers. Buddhism, on the other hand, has no deities,
<i>per s&eacute;</i>. Rather, Buddhism recognizes that there is duality in
all things, so creation and destruction, or good and evil, or
love and hate, or light and dark, or positive and negative,
are two sides of the same coin, and you can't have one without the other.
Judaism sees God as observing the world from above,
usually with some bemusement, and not
interfering with human affairs down here much at all.
Christianity mostly
takes that approach, but many sects are very mixed up on the subject.
Some sects see life on Earth as a chess match between God and Satan,
with us as the pawns.
Others see it as a football game, with God and Satan as opposing coaches,
and we are stuck in the middle of the field, as players,
and have to win the game for God.
(Well, assuming that you decided to play for God's team, that is...)
In neither of those cases is God all-powerful.
There wouldn't be much point to it if God could always just cheat
and fix the game whenever He started to lose...
<p>
An incomplete religion like Buchmanism, or the A.A. religion,
has a problem when the believers want to declare that God has complete
control of the world when he is doing favors for A.A. members, but
does not have control of the world when bad things are happening
to non-members...
<p>
I call those religions incomplete because they are not thoroughly
thought out. They are not philosophically or logically self-consistent.
They are little more than collections of unconnected superstitions.
It is ridiculously Pollyannaish to say that God is controlling the
world and doing favors for me, but God is ignoring the rest of the
world, so God isn't responsible for any of the bad stuff
that happens elsewhere.
<p>
The A.A. or Buchmanite believer is likely to answer, &quot;That bad
stuff is caused by people who are doing their own will, rather than
obeying the Will of God.&quot;
<p>
Nope, that is just dodging the issue. If God has control over this
world, then God has to relinquish control to allow some little fool
to cause trouble.
<p>
Imagine this scenario: I see a child carrying a gun into his
school, to shoot up
the place. Imagine that I can easily take the gun away from the kid,
and keep him from hurting anyone. But instead of doing that, I say,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;That youngster has free will. I shall let him exercise
his free will.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
If I were to really do that, then I would be criminally responsible
for some kids getting shot.
<p>
It's called &quot;Criminally Negligent Homicide,&quot; and it's a
real crime.
You can be charged with killing people when you never lifted a finger to
hurt them, when you just negligently failed to do what would keep them
from getting killed.
<p>
It's also called &quot;Depraved Indifference&quot;. That's what the Christian
Scientist parents, and now
&quot;<a href="orange-letters265.html#Followers" target="_blank">Follwers of Christ</a>&quot;
parents, get charged with after they let their children die
by refusing to take them to a doctor and get them some competent
medical care.

<p>
I can't get off of the hook by saying that I simply chose to not control
the situation, that I gave the child free will, and that I allowed the kid
to do whatever he wished just because he was being rebellious and
self-seeking, and did not wish to do my will.

<p>
No, I wouldn't get off of the hook that easily. And the Higher Power
who micro-manages the world doesn't get off of the hook that easily either.
He ends up getting the blame for everything. Allowing bad people
to do bad things to this world is controlling the world just as much
as not allowing them to do it.

</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
The answers that most religions have come up with are:
<ul>
<li>
<font color="blue">
One: To say that God <i>does</i> micro-manage the world</font>, or is intimately
involved in everything, down to the individual atoms, and is
responsible for everything. That's Hinduism and Buddhism. But note that,
in those religions,
there is no &quot;Will of God&quot; like the Fundamentalist Christians describe.
Such a will is a very human thing.
<p>
In Hinduism or Buddhism, the only
&quot;Will of God&quot; that exists is exactly what is happening right
now, everywhere in the universe.
God's Will is that the atoms exist, and the electrons keep orbitting the nuclei,
and the force of gravity holds everything together.
God definitely <i>does not</i> sit up on Cloud Nine and grumble
about, &quot;I wish Joe Blow would quit screwing his secretary&quot;, or
&quot;I wish the Egyptians would quit enslaving the Israelites.&quot;
<p>
In Hinduism, it's like God made the entire physical universe out of Himself,
so He's now busy being everything down here,
and there is nobody upstairs to call on and ask Him to change things.
<p>
<li>
<font color="blue">
Two: To say that God <i>does not</i> micro-manage every little detail of
this world</font>, so He really isn't responsible for all of the bad stuff
that happens. That's Judaism, Islam, and most sects of Christianity.
There, the believers claim that God does have a Will, but is incapable
of doing it Himself, so He needs us to do it on the physical plane for Him.
<p>
(I know, I know, a lot of people will start screaming about
&quot;God is Omnipotent and can do anything.&quot;
But that shoves God and His abilities back up to category One above,
where God <i>does</i> micro-manage the world after all. And to claim
that God <i>can</i> micro-manage the world, but refrains from doing so
because He gave us free will, just gets us back to God being guilty of
Criminally Negligent Homicide, and makes God an irresponsible micromanager.)
</ul>
<p>
But A.A. members don't have the benefit of either of those two
religious doctrines. A.A. theology tries to be half and half.
A.A. members claim that God <i>is</i> running their lives, and
<i>is</i> keeping them
from drinking, but God <i>isn't</i> responsible for any of the bad stuff.
So they have opened up that nasty can of worms, and bought into the
whole puzzle. They end up with a religion that is illogical, and
is not self-consistent &#8212; a religion that contradicts itself:<br>
<ul>
<b>
<li>
God <i>is</i> running my life and is responsible for all of
the good stuff that I do,
<li> but God <i>is not</i> running my life,
and is not responsible for all of the bad stuff that I do.
</b>
</ul>
<p>
And likewise:<br>
<ul>
<b>
<li> God <i>is</i> running the world and is responsible for all of
the good stuff that happens,
<li> but God <i>is not</i> running the world,
and is not responsible for all of the bad stuff that happens.
</b>
</ul>

<p>
Some A.A. members claim to have the answer: God gives Free Will
to all people,
and lets them do whatever they wish. And it's usually evil.
God only interferes in this world
to help a few people, those who are seeking and doing God's Will.
<p>
That leaves A.A. members with an even more callous and cruel
God than any other
religion around here is describing. God is so mean and unloving that He
will allow children to be beaten and raped, old ladies to be murdered,
and whole populations of Jews, Russians, Vietnamese, Cambodians,
Tutsis, Tibetans, Native Americans,
or Bosnians to be slaughtered in genocidal
wars, and God doesn't give a damn about those people because they aren't
grovelling before him, confessing all of their sins, and begging
for knowledge of God's Will and the power to carry it out?
<p>
God only loves the Buchmanites and the Twelve-Steppers, and everyone else
in the world can just drop dead? A.A. just gets weirder and weirder.

<h2><li> Afterlife </h2>
<p>
Another aspect of the incompleteness of the 12-Step religion is
the question of an afterlife. A.A. basically has nothing to say on
the subject. All that Bill Wilson offered people was a sober
&quot;<a href="orange-letters19.html#Heaven_on_Earth" target="_blank">Heaven on Earth</a>&quot; in the present.
<p>
Some 12-Step believers will now
claim that this shows that A.A. is not really a religion;
it is just an add-on
to other religions. They wish to leave such theological questions
to the other religions. But that doesn't wash when the Hazelden
Foundation is telling us to
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#undercut" target="_blank">set our religion aside</a>
and just practice
the A.A. 12-Step program to get A.A.-style &quot;spirituality&quot;.
A.A. most assuredly <i>is</i> a religion &#8212; it's just an incomplete one
that fails to address such issues.

<h2><li> The A.A. God:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The A.A. God is the generic brand that comes in a plain white
box at the supermarket.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God has a lot of will. He has a Will for everything
and everybody, and everybody is supposed to do <i>something</i> to
please God. Apparently, the A.A. God did not succeed in making the
world the way that He wanted it to be, so both He
and his followers have to be constantly changing things,
trying to get it right.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God is an authoritarian male figure Who closely
resembles an Old-Testament patriarch, like Charlton Heston playing
Moses.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God is a <i>dictator.</i>
<p>
<li> The A.A. God wants you to be a slave forever.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God loves you the most when you are grovelling on your knees,
confessing what a worthless sinner you are. Only then will the A.A. God do
favors for you.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God is highly illogical, if not outright insane.
First, the A.A. God will stick you with the genes for alcoholism
and make you a born alcoholic,
then He will wish you weren't an alcoholic and an excessive
drinker. Go figure.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God has a grand plan for you: First, incurable alcoholism,
and then, more incurable alcoholism.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God is so harsh that He will condemn you to a horrible
painful death by alcohol unless you properly perform your sycophant duties
<i>every day.</i> The A.A. God routinely kills alcoholics who don't <i>Work the Steps</i>
thoroughly.

<p>
<li> When the A.A. God heals alcoholics, He only fixes them for one
day at a time. For some unknown reason, God's magic wears off after
24 hours.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God micromanages the world. He is constantly
tweaking everything, pulling millions and billions of puppet strings to make
things happen differently, to make things turn out exactly the
way He wants, and to convenience some of his followers.
<p>
<li> The A.A. God cheats at solitaire.

<a name="ftnt01"> </a>
<a href="#ftnt01_ret">1</a>)
The <i>Big Book Unplugged; A Young Person's Guide to Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
has a credibility problem. Page 44 declares
that the DSM-IV describes &quot;the symptoms of alcoholism&quot;.
It doesn't. The American Psychiatric Association
never used the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; in their
<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>.
They described two related conditions: <i>Alcohol Dependency</i>, and <i>Alcohol Abuse</i>,
but they carefully avoided endorsing the idea of any such &quot;spiritual disease&quot;
as &quot;alcoholism&quot;. Nevertheless, the author deceptively wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To demonstrate that addiction is now officially considered a disease,
mention that medical doctors look for specific symptoms in diagnosing
alcoholism and chemical dependency. They are outlined in the
<i>DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders)</i>, published by the American Psychiatric Association.
This is a physician's bible.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
As is usual for steppers, this author once again repeats
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#symptom" target="_blank">the mistake of Bill Wilson and Marty Mann</a>
&#8212; confusing the <i>symptoms of a disease</i> with the
<i>signs of a disease</i>.
The DSM lists signs of mental disorders, not symptoms.
The symptoms of a disease are what the patient complains about.
The signs of a disease are what the doctor observes and measures.<br>
(If the DSM-IV listed all of the symptoms &#8212; complaints &#8212;
of mentally ill people, it would really be a strange book.)<br>
<font color="blue">
(But guess what the DSM-IV really does list?
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">Delusions of Grandeur</a>,
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>, the signs of which Bill Wilson
prominently displayed.)
</font>
<p>
Also, the DSM-IV is the &quot;bible&quot; of psychiatrists, not &quot;medical doctors&quot;
or &quot;physicians&quot;.<br>

<p>
Likewise, page 51 of <i>BB Unplugged</i> tells us that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Chapter 8 is written by wives, but you don't need to be a wife to benefit from
the authors' advice.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is totally untrue, and everybody who knows the history of
the <i>Big Book</i> knows it.
Bill Wilson wouldn't let his wife write the <i>To Wives</i> chapter even though
she very much wanted to do it. Bill Wilson didn't trust his wife Lois to &quot;get the
style right&quot;, he said, so
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#jealous" target="_blank">he wrote it himself</a>,
while saying that the wives of the alcoholics wrote it.<br>
So why does the author of <i>Big Book Unplugged</i> insist on
repeating Bill Wilson's old lies to the youthful newcomers?

This book was written by another stepper &#8212; the name 'Matthew Raphael' is a pen name &#8212;

but it also contains a bunch of surprises,
like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his and Bob's spook sessions &#8212; talking
to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping,

This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is very positively
slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author knew Mr. Wilson and worked
beside him for the last 12 years of Mr. Wilson's life.

his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his years-long

<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Francis Hartigan<br>
Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10010, 2000.<br>
ISBN 0-312-20056-0<br>
Dewey: B W11h 2000<br>
Francis Hartigan was the secretary of and confidant to Bill Wilson's wife Lois.
This book is pretty much a white-wash and tells the whole story from Bill's point
of view. But it does contain a few surprises, like the chapter &quot;The Other Woman&quot;
which details Bill's love affair with Helen Wynn, and hints at all of his other affairs
where he cheated on Lois, both before and after sobriety, all of his married life.

in Letters</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Robert Fitzgerald, S.J.<br>

This book includes Bill's letters to Father Dowling where he
describes his psychic contact with spirits from the &quot;other side&quot;,
including &quot;Boniface&quot;, who was supposedly a medieval
Benedictine missionary and English. Father Dowling answered that he felt
that Bill was making contact with evil spirits who were deceiving him.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Boniface" target="_blank">See page 59</a>.
It also contains letters describing Bill's LSD usage &#8212; that is the subject of
all of chapter 13.

<i>Hope, Faith, and Courage; Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;

Cocaine Anonymous World Services, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, 1993.<br>
ISBN 0-9638193-0-5 (hardcvr) ; ISBN 0-9638193-1-3 (softcvr) ; ISBN 0-9638193-9-9 (H&amp;I edition)<br>
A book of
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_testimonies" target="_blank">testimonials</a>
(<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">proof by anecdote</a>)
from the headquarters of Cocaine Anonymous.
Among other things, it teaches us the heresies that &quot;Today I know that I am powerless
over the outcome of everything and that my life is still unmanageable by me&quot; (page 38),
and GOD = &quot;the <u>G</u>roup <u>O</u>f <u>D</u>rug addicts at the meetings&quot; (page 13).
Most of the book is devoted to telling us that the story writers were miserable until they
joined Cocaine Anonymous, and they were made just <i>so happy</i> by doing the Twelve Steps.

This is largely extracts from the <i>Big Book</i>, rewritten with the goal
of enticing young people into the organization. Rather insidious stuff, besides
being incorrect.

<i>My Name Is Bill: Bill Wilson &#8212; His Life And The Creation Of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Susan Cheever<br>
Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, London, Toronto, Sydney, 2004.<br>
LC: HV5032.W19C44 2004<br>
Dewey: 362.292092--dc22 or B W11c 2004<br>
ISBN: 0-7432-0154-X<br>
Another biography of Bill Wilson written by a stepper with a bad case of
hero worship. She glosses over and rationalizes all of Bill Wilson's faults.
She even claims that Bill Wilson was right when he was conducting s&eacute;ances &#8212;
that he really was talking to the spirits of the dead.
