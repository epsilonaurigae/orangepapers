<font color="#BF0000">
This conversation with Craig M. started in a newsgroup in November, 2001,
with a question about the tacit conspiracy to stereotype alcoholics,
described at the start of the
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">Us Stupid Drunks</a>&quot; web page.
</font>
<br>

<pre>

&gt; &gt; Conspiracy? I think yes. Not like secret agents and James Bond,
&gt; &gt; or the assassination of JFK, but rather, a silent, tacit agreement
&gt; &gt; between people to shove a particular stereotype on vulnerable beginners.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That stereotype gets the beginners wasting their time trying to fix
&gt; &gt; the personality defects of Bill Wilson, not their own problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the end, that stereotype kills people. It doesn't kill them all,
&gt; &gt; not by a long shot, but it kills enough people to make it a real tragedy.
</font><a name="only_game_in_town">&gt;</a>
&gt; I guess I feel like AA is what it is, and its members are who they are.  Is
&gt; it the best method?  I can't really say, but in a lot of areas, it's the
&gt; only game in town.  When something better comes along, I'm sure it will gain
&gt; popular acceptance and come into common utilization.  Until then,  we may
&gt; just have to make do.
</pre>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Is it a method at all? It doesn't look like it.<br>
It is what it is? The same is true of any organization, including the
Catholic Church, the KKK, the Taliban, and the Republican Party.
<p>

To say that it is the only game in town is only saying that it is a
very successful organization, not that it is a good organization.<br>
Likewise, if you wish to get yourself processed into being an
&quot;operating thetan&quot;, then Scientology is &quot;the only game in town.&quot;
It too, is very successful, with branch offices in every city...
<p>

We may have to make do with AA/NA? Why?
With their immense <b><i>zero percent</i></b> success rate, there is no reason
to &quot;make do&quot; with it. See:<br>

<p>
<a name="solution3"> </a>
<pre> 
&gt; As far as the conspiracy of stereotyping, I wonder what you would offer as a
&gt; solution.  We could tell the newcomers that if they truly set their minds to
&gt; it, then they will surely be able to control their drinking or be able to
&gt; stop completely on their own.  But it seems to me that drinking alcoholics
&gt; are told that all along, from a variety of sources.  &quot;If you would only
&gt; (fill in the blank), then you could/would stop drinking&quot;  That doesn't seem
&gt; to have helped most folks too much.
</pre>
<p>

<font color="blue">
The solution is very simple: start telling the truth. Alcoholics are all
different. They are not all clones of William G. Wilson. What might
have helped Bill Wilson is not necessarily good for everyone else.
<p>

The real solution is so simple that lots of people don't want to
accept it:<br>
People drink when they want to drink, and quit when they want to quit.<br>
End of story.<br>
They always control their own drinking.<br>
Now they may not be controlling, or sanely handling, their desires,
but that is something else, something very different.
It's like the guy who says,<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;Really, I can quit any time I want to. I just can't want to quit.&quot;</font><br>
You can't make someone quit until they want to. That's why all of the
drug and alcohol rehab programs have such horrible failure rates.
They fail to make people *REALLY* want to quit.
Obviously, you won't make it off of drugs or alcohol if you only
&quot;sort of&quot; want to quit.
<p>

So how do you make people want to quit? Ah, now, that's the real
problem. Can you? Can you exert such mind control over other people?
<p>

Lots of people are confused about what they really want.
They say that they want to quit drinking or smoking, but they don't,
not really. They just sort of think they want to.
They want to quit until the withdrawal hits, and then they change
their minds.
At the minute that they reach for another cigarette and light up,
or put that next drink into their mouths and swallow it, they are
doing precisely what they want to do. They are not &quot;out of control.&quot;
Now someone might be &quot;out of control&quot; after 8 or 10 drinks, when
he just keeps on blindly downing another and another until he passes
out, but he was not out of control when he started drinking.
<p>
The whole A.A. first step is wrong:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are powerless over alcohol,
and our lives are unmanageable.&quot;<br></font>

Totally untrue.<br>
Bill Wilson just couldn't come to terms with the fact that he
felt cravings that he couldn't control. That is, he couldn't stop
feeling the cravings. Neither can I. But we don't have to give
in to those cravings, just because cravings are sometimes very uncomfortable.
They pass... And the longer you stay quit, the more the cravings
fade out.
<p>
But what about the people who want to drink themselves to death?
It is hard to accept, but some people just decide that they would
rather die, and just want to stay drunk or stoned until the end.
There may not be anything we can do to fix that problem, other
than perhaps declare them insane and lock them up...
But do we want to do that? Just lock someone up for the rest of
his life, because he will drink himself to death if we let him go?</font>

<p>
<a name="claim_defects"> </a>
<pre> 
&gt; As far as &quot;character defects&quot; go, I suppose that each individual is free to
&gt; choose the defects he's willing to claim as his own.
</pre>
<p>

<font color="blue">
That is ridiculous cult dogma, and I'm not buying it.
<p>
The standard A.A. religious dogma says that alcoholics are just loaded with &quot;moral
shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character&quot;, and that one of their common
defects is that they are so
dishonest that they will only admit to having (&quot;claim&quot;)
some of those defects. They deny
the others (aka, &quot;they are <i>in denial</i>&quot;),
and can only gradually admit just how bad they really are. And then
the dogma also says that we love our defects (or
<a href="orange-secrets.html#exceed_intended_purpose"><i>sins</i>, as Bill Wilson called
them in 12x12</a>), and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Gorski1">we don't want to give them up</a>.
According to Bill Wilson, alcoholics are spiritual slobs
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#too_good">who don't want to get
too good too soon</a>.
<p>
Notice how &quot;claiming your defects&quot; is a
<i>&quot;damned if you do and damned if you don't&quot;</i>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind">double-bind</a>,
just like a medieval witch trial:<br>
1. If you &quot;claim&quot; a bunch of defects, then you are confessing that you are
a defective, flawed sinner.<br>
2. If you don't &quot;claim&quot; a bunch of defects, then that proves that
you are a dishonest defective flawed sinner who is <i>in denial</i> and refusing to
be truthful about what a bad sinner you are.

<p>
Bill Wilson declared that all alcoholics had huge
inflated egos, and thought that they were the center of the universe,
and they were too big and too good to need God. Wilson also claimed that
they were all massively dishonest, manipulative, and self-seeking.
That is not true of very many people, but it was very true of Bill Wilson
with his messianic complex and his delusions of grandeur, and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">his theft and fraud</a>.
According to Henrietta Seiberling, he even ended
up claiming that he was here to finish the work that Jesus Christ had
not finished, and then,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-funny_spirituality.html#Henrietta">
he claimed to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ</a>.<br>

<p>
None of us have to buy into the idea that we have Bill Wilson's insane
character defects. We don't have to &quot;claim those defects.&quot;<br>
I am not Bill Wilson, thank God for small favors!<br>
That doesn't mean that I think I'm perfect, not at all. I just have
other issues to work on than Bill did, VERY different issues. I simply
do not have a messianic complex or delusions of grandeur.
If anything, I suffer from an inferiority complex, but I'm getting better.
</font>

<p>
<pre> 
&gt; Will working toward
&gt; becoming a better human being keep one from drinking?  Maybe not, but it
&gt; probably doesn't hurt much, either.
</pre>
<p>

<font color="blue">
It would be nice if that is what the program did...<br>
But why am I hearing all of this garbage about bad sponsors
thirteenth-stepping the girls all of the time?<br>
Why are the sponsors telling my friends not to take their
doctor-prescribed medications?<br>
Why are the fanatics telling the newcomers that the answer to
everything is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Do the Twelve Steps, get a sponsor, and read the Big Book.&quot;<br></font>

<p>

All of those self-improvement claims seem to be a smoke screen,
covering up what the program really is.<br>
Scientology also claims to be a wonderful self-improvement program,
but it is really just an evil cult...
</font>

<p>
<pre> 
&gt; It does seem that eliminating personal
&gt; turmoil from one's life may reduce the excuses that a person might tend to
&gt; fall back on in order to justify taking a drink.
</pre>
<p>

<font color="blue">That sounds fair to me.</font>

<p>
<a name="alternative"> </a>
<pre> 
&gt; The thing is, it is easy to sit back and criticize AA from the peanut
&gt; gallery.  It is a far tougher thing to affect real changes, either within
&gt; the structure and fellowship of AA, or even in developing new, and possibly
&gt; better, methods to treat and cope with the problems associated with
&gt; alcoholism.  It you can offer any real solutions, Terry,  I'm all ears.
</pre>
<p>

<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but I'm not sitting in the peanut gallery. Please quit being so
condescending. (That's another hall-mark of a stepper: they love to
be <a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm">condescending</a>.)<br>
I'm in the front lines, watching my friends go down the tubes,
watching people die, in spite of all of those 12-step meetings that we have
all been sent to... It really gets old when you talk to a friend,
part ways cheerfully, and then a couple of days later hear that he's
dead because he got drunk and stepped in front of a car...
<p>

That's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">
another standard AA dodge</a>: &quot;Don't criticize our cult religion unless
you have a foolproof 100%-effective alternative cure for alcoholism.&quot;
<p>

I just got my one-year coin and keytag, AA and NA,
and I'm happy to say that I never did the Twelve Steps, I don't have a
sponsor, and I don't believe in the Big Book.
And the only A.A. meetings I've been to in the last 6 months were to
go pick up the coins as they came due,
and to show that I was still making it...
And Bill Wilson was clinically insane, suffering from delusions
of grandeur, so I don't follow his &quot;teachings&quot; at all.
<p>

I am saddened by the immense number of friends and acquaintances who were
in the program with me, but who didn't make it.
One of the things that has been killing my friends is the lies of AA and NA,
the immense amount of misinformation.
<p>

It really is like a horrible game of survivor. There are just three or
four of us left out of about 100 of us who started a year ago.
Now some of those people who relapsed and bombed out of the program are
back in, trying again, so we might get a few more successes, but the
&quot;success rate&quot; is still dismal, a really large failure rate.
In the end, those few successes are just people saving themselves,
not anything that the 12-step programs accomplished.
<p>

I am very much looking for any things that will work. Anything.
Do you really imagine that I wouldn't do something to save the lives
of my friends? Do you think that I would reject AA/NA if it did save my
friends' lives? You have it backwards. I dislike AA/NA because I found out
what it is by being in it and watching the program fail, and watching
my friends relapse left and right, and even seeing a few die.
<p>

I go to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>
meetings just so I don't have to grit my teeth at
the start of every meeting, while someone reads the lies about how
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;These Twelve Buchmanist cult religion steps are how we achieved sobriety.&quot;</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path...&quot;</font>
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> is
nice because you can tell the truth without starting a civil
war. You can even question any of the tenets without being told slogans
like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth.&quot;</font>
<p>

One of the best things that has worked for me is recognizing the base
brain (lizard brain) trying to talk me into drinking and smoking.
Go read<br>

<p>

And I'm working on other stuff. But really, I don't have and don't expect
to have any magic cure-all. I don't think that there is any magic cure.
That is the stuff of childish fairy tales, not real life.

Hi,
<p>

I am concluding that you choose to be anonymous, so I can't provide
a proper greeting. This may be a little long, but I think you will
think it has some points worth noting.
<p>

I have spent a good deal of time reading just about everything you
have written here. I think it is excellent. I wholeheartedly commend
you for thinking for yourself.
<p>

I am a person who quit drinking 24 years ago, starting with going to
AA. I was a very faithful attendee till about the 12th year or so at
which time I got busy and didn't go much. Then when I started to go
back, I was in a new area, didn't know people and couldn't go often
enough to really have the amount of contact required to really be an
insider at the meetings. I think that is a critical point. You have
to go a lot to the same groups to really be accepted or known. <p>

The last couple years I moved again to a smaller city. I decided to
check out the AA groups and found small friendly groups. I have been
going but doubt if I will continue. I simply find that I don't think
or feel like people seem to think and feel. And I don't feel any
desire to try to be more like them at all. I feel warmth and fondness
for the people. Of course, they are much impressed with the length of
my non-drinking. <p>
<a name="suicide"> </a>
Not long after I returned I went to a meeting one night to note that
some of the older members were in a rather stunned state. Another
older member who attended a nearby group had commited suicide. They
were baffled. They described him as an established member who always
had something good to say... no clue... etc. <p>

I thought I might understand. One of the things that stopped me from
going is that it was completely pointless to go to AA if I really had
a lot of pain or a problem. I never ever got an answer there. I got
more pain, usually, or convinced that there was something wrong with
me for having the problem in the first place. I just learned to quit
bringing it up. That became especially obvious after I got more
&quot;time.&quot; People with less time are expecting a miraculous state of
nirvana to enter their lives at some point and they are hoping it
comes before they are sober as long as me. They sure don't want to
think that someone with my &quot;time&quot; is all screwed up or having a bad
time of it. They don't want to hear it and will resoundingly ignore
it and me. I ended up feeling humiliated as well as alone. Talk about
feeling alone! Better to be alone than be alone in a group where your
expectations are for succor. Compassion is very rare in AA. It is
reserved for unavoidable catastrophes and natural disasters and your
grief better be brief. <p>

So I guess I don't care to go because it just doesn't help to go.
<p>
<a name="angry"> </a>
I have also noted how angry so many of the &quot;old timers&quot; are. I have
observed that closely and concluded for myself that the problem is
that most people have a lot of grief in their lives and in a way, AA
is always focusing on losses. At the same time there is nowhere to
go with grief as it isn't allowed. So the sadness gets stuffed
leaving only the anger to be dumped out in the meeting, usually aimed
at someone who isn't getting the program or was foolish enough to
tell the truth about their selfish life. Notice that sometime. Old
timers in AA are often an angry lot: a mask of serenity with a
seething cauldron underneath. <p>

One thing I think you might consider as a positive for the 12 steps.
My relationship with alcohol was obsessive. Whether I thought about
it or tried to avoid thinking about it, I was always thinking about
it. The great thing about the &quot;powerlessness concept&quot; for me was that
I stopped OBSESSING about it and always thinking how I should stop or
trying to stop. If I was powerless I could give up thinking about it,
which ended the obsessing which helped me stop drinking. <p>

I also wondered if you had ever encountered what I knew as the &quot;Yale
study&quot; which tested people at college age and at five year intervals
thereafter. Then they tried to see if the people who later became
alcoholics had similar scores in the beginning. They found that the
people had nothing in common at the beginning of the study but became
more similar over time (presumably from the chronic effects of
consuming a depressant drug on a regular basis). I wish I could find
some reference to that study to send you a link or something. Even in
the end, the similarities were fairly minor: similar on the
depressive scale as I recall, which would make sense of you're
ingesting one. <p>

I would enjoy reading more of your articles. I really enjoyed them
and found them very interesting and well done. I would enjoy
corresponding with you as well. <p>

best regards <br>
Bernie

<a name="Linda"> </a>
...unfortunately from what I have seen, AA does little to
<a href="orange-jokes.html#ubermensch">
clean up the gene pool</a>. What usually happens is, say, I have six
or eight kids in foster care, a man has a few that he never sees and
doesn't pay child support; then we meet and get pregnant with more!!!
[Usually while one or both of us is still married to the family we
were supposed to be raising...].
<br>
<br>When I have tried to point out the irresponsibility of such behaviour,
you hear things like, 'well, I had to let my old family go... for
the good of my sobriety'... Any ex-spouses who are not 'true believers'
and totally immersed in 12 Step BS are just misguided, they don't
understand us, we are so much more evolved... maybe that old spouse
will marry someone else who 'drinks' and then we can really crow
that THEY have a problem...
<br>
<br>The truth of the matter is abandoned wives and husbands don't
understand. While working 2 jobs, taking the kids to church, checking
homework, doing laundry and making dinner; no they don't understand
why the AA member's sobriety is 'threatened' unless they just sit in
a room and smoke cigarettes and drink coffee two or three times a
day for hours... The 'abandonee' doesn't understand because they are
a mature adult, who lives up to adult responsibilities.

<br>
<br>WHAT HAPPENED TO CLEANING UP THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PAST? Meanwhile
those children your Mother raised while you drank are now being raised
by her again, while you get sober!!
<br>
<br>I can't believe the losers that have asked me out in AA; oh by
the way, a date in AA means they buy you a cup of coffee, try to
sleep with you and then probably move in, as most of the unmarried
AA members I have met who are men, either live with their Mommy or
in a halfway house... anyway, these creeps say they can't afford to
divorce their former wives... well here in Jacksonville, Florida,
at my courthouse, a divorce costs $168 to file... if you don't even
have $168, why are you trying to start a new relationship?? What a
bunch of wackos!!

<a name="Buchmanite1"> </a>

Dear A. Orange: 

<p>
Hello.  My name is David and I'm a student at Northwestern University. 

<p>
I ran across your piece on &quot;The Religious Roots of the Twelve Steps&quot; and was 
particularly interested in your characterization of Frank Buchman.  I had not 
heard much at all about his, albeit tempered, praise of Hitler and his fascist 
front against Communism.  I am also intrigued by your characterization of his 
relations with women and his obsession with sexual purity.  The allusions to 
his homosexuality and concurrent homophobia are also new to me.  I would very 
much appreciate hearing more about your research and discussing your opinions 
of his movement. 

<p>
You may be surprised that any of this is NOT new to me. I am, in fact, familiar 
with MRA's work around the world today, and in particular their work in racial 
reconciliation and community building in the &quot;Hope in the Cities&quot; campaign 
accross America.  My confusion with your essay, begins with the absence, in my 
experience, of any sense of the organization as a religion, or cult.  They are 
certainly not Christian-biased but rather multi-faith, including Jews, Muslims, 
Hindus, Buddhists, Agnostics, etc.  They also seem an incredibly open minded 
group far from any fanaticism and rather centered on causes that no decent 
person could disagree with.  I suppose I am curious to know what knowledge you 
have of MRA today, which I believe is now becoming more known as I.C. or 
<a href="orange-rroot750.html#links">Initiatives of Change</a>.
Perhaps an understanding of the organization today 
might alter somewhat you're rather extreme take on their origins and history. 

<p>
That said, please don't write off dialogue with me based on my apparent 
conviction of mind on this.  I think it very likely that their founder had 
some, shall we say, serious issues.  But I also believe he must have had some 
wonderful gifts, courageous conviction, and, yes, Wisdom.  Wisdom that came 
from what he called guidance from God, but what you and I may just as easily 
understand to be meditation and reflection, the like of which could assist any 
leader or individual in their path of life.  But my knowledge has been mostly

Hello David,
<p>
I'm surprised to see that the old MRA gang is still around, and still making the
same claims. Geez Louise, 70 years and they still haven't even made up any new lies?
They are not
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#racial_reconciliation">building racial reconciliation</a>
in the cities or anything else.
They aren't doing anything, really. For all practical purposes, the organization does
not even exist. It's just a few old die-hards with delusions of grandeur.
<p>
And pardon me, but the
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler">Hitler-loving Frank Buchman</a> did
not have &quot;Wisdom&quot;,
and his claims of receiving
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">Guidance from God</a> were a fraud.
<p>
Nevertheless, I'd still be interested in hearing more about the current MRA.

<p>

Do you know anywhere else a person can go to handle
there alcoholic problem for FREE?
<p>

Who cares if it is a cult. It's FREE. What do they
tell you in there? &quot;There are no dues or fees&quot;. &quot;The
only requirement is a desire to stop drinking&quot;. Not a
desire to obtain a religion. Look up in the sky on a
clear night and try to count all the stars. I wonder
who put them there? Keep it simple.
<p>

What do you want out of life? 
<p>

My friend, guess what else is FREE?   FREE WILL 
<p>

Consequence costs money, FREE WILL doesn't.
<p>

The only reason why I stay in AA is because it is FREE.

Read your piece, &quot;The Funny Spirituality of AA,&quot; and just wanted to
tease 
out some fundamental differences between smoking and alcohol that
allude 
you. As for your other comments re: Bill W's spirituality, et al,
I have no 
comment. Nothing you wrote struck me as particularly eye opening,
but 
neither did I find it off base.
<p>

<font color="blue">
That's good. I don't really view anything I'm saying as new.
Most of it has been said by others before. I often feel like I'm
just a librarian, gathering up a bunch of information into one
place where people can find it easily...
</font>

<p>

No one &#8212; not Bill Wilson, not Lois, not Dr. Bob, nor the Surgeon 
General &#8212; seeks to minimalize the dangers of smoking to the body. 
Let me 
take that back: In fact, in his day, Bill and Lois and the good
Doctor were 
actually less aware but that's beside the point. The enormous
difference 
between these two highly addictive substances is in the areas they
affect: 
Cigarettes affect the physical body and some physiological
processes rather 
dramatically. Alcohol aids and abets the deterioration of soul and
mind, in 
that order.  I guess it boils down to a determination of which
center, body 
or mind, most represents this entity we call Person. My belief is
it is 
that person's essence, soul, Being, and that area is most clearly
affected 
by alcohol.
<p>

<font color="blue">
That's the big thing: In the long run, I believe that tobacco
does the same thing to people. It did to me. It just takes longer.
But I smoked for 33 years, and when I add it all up, I see a
ton of stuff that I'd like not to see, like all of the times
I wouldn't go out and play ball with my son because I felt a little
too sick and tired from the effects of tobacco...
Or all of the times I was dragging my ass doing something until
my wife got pissed off at how hard it was to get me to do things...
After 10 or 20 years, that stuff really affects you.
I guess I'd have to say that it changes you.
<font color="#BF0000">(Yeh, it kills you.)</font>
<p>

In the long run, I can't help but feel that I was simply a different
person on tobacco, someone other than the best person that I
could be, or wanted to be. And that is exactly the problem with
alcohol or heroin, too.
</font>

<p>
The predisposition to &quot;outsiderness,&quot; &quot;depression,&quot; 
&quot;loneliness&quot; that is the trademark of the alcoholic is
exacerbated and then, 
ultimately, CAUSED by the alcohol, and then is simply the no brakes
vehicle 
to complete insanity. Estrangement* from one's fellow men
unequivocally 
causes a spiritual and emotional bankruptcy so severe as to render
that 
person inhuman. Cigarettes merely kill the body. I say &quot;merely&quot;
because at 
least as they are killing it, that person has the luxury of a
relatively 
intact mental, emotional, and perhaps even spiritual life.
<p>


<font color="blue">
Yep, again, the killing just takes longer.
And there is no doubt in my mind that tobacco causes depression,
too. The attitude towards life like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, well, what did you expect? It's all a drag anyway. Life is
 just a pain because that's how it is,&quot;
</font>
is caused by tobacco. Now that I have a year and
a half off of tobacco, I watch the people standing outside of the
buildings during smoke breaks, and see the drawn, gray, looks on
their faces,
and listen to how they talk, and it's all so obvious.
</font>


<p>
(*estrangement as distinct from separation. I am not referring to
the Henry 
David Thoreau school of thought here, but to a critically
impoverished state 
of mind)
<p>



<font color="blue">
Personally, I am having increasing difficulty figuring out where
'physical' leaves off and 'spiritual' starts. Something that sickens
my body so that I can't or don't do the good things that I would
like to do certainly has spiritual implications...
</font>
<p>

I just wanted to weigh in with these thoughts. This is rather
rushed as I am at work. Thanks for listening.

Your points, the few that I have read, have some validity. The things I have read are about the dry drunk, the &quot;killjoy cover up&quot;, and the bit about AA members thinking they have better medical advice than doctors.
<p>

  The dry drunk one I  figured out on my own from the beginning. Such arrogance some people exhibit when
declaring someone else's sobriety of low quality 
because they got sober in a different way. Where is the humility there?   
<p>
  The lack admitting that alcohol consumption was fun you are not totally correct in saying that it is doctrine or
totally through AA.  Many people in AA share about the good times.  Although I have been to some groups that are
depressive and seem to &quot;kill joy.&quot;  I generally do not go back to those meetings.  Personally my situation per
remembering the good times was no problem before I came into AA.  I would wipe the memory of drinking problems
out. Then blame my drinking related problems on anything from a full moon to a girl friend to Ronald Reagan. That
was denial.  My sponsor told me he had to watch out for what he called glorifying a drink.  I did and still do have to
remember why I stopped drinking in the first place.  My alcoholic brain would like me to forget. 
<p>
   As far as the medicine goes I like to remind those old timers about the &quot;singleness of purpose&quot;  and question
them on how much drug they are taking as they mass consume coffee and cigarettes.    
<p>
   There is one thing I know for certain and that is that there are days in my sobriety that I would have picked up a
drink if not for actively being a member of AA. 
For that I thank God. 
<p>

sincerely, Rik

(the 5% success rate is so bleak)
<p>

One question today....... does anything I do make any difference? You
know, Al-Anon is big on pulling spouses in to &quot;get well,&quot;
which may then steer the alcoholic towards recovery, but ONLY if you
are indifferent to such an outcome.
 I did Al-Anon sporadically for a time but got tired of it 
&#8212; and all the cigarette smoke!
<p>
<a name="success_rate"> </a>
<font color="blue">
At the risk of sounding simplistic, the rate for your husband
won't be 5%. It will be either 100% or zero, depending on whether
he wants to quit. That seems to be the big thing to me &#8212; actually,
really, wanting to quit. If he doesn't want to quit, the success
rate will of course be zero. If he REALLY wants to quit, the odds
of success are very high.
<p>

The more I look at the whole treatment industry, and whether a
program will &quot;really work&quot; to make you quit,
the more it looks like
a joke. It's like you are paying somebody else to make you want to
quit. No wonder it doesn't work.
<p>

The Al-Anon approach looks like another sad joke. Bill Wilson just
couldn't stand his wife Lois nagging him, so he pushed this policy of
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Only an alcoholic can help another alcoholic. The wives should
just shut up and just call the A.A. men to come and solve the
problem.&quot;
</font>
<p>

Anything you can do? Yes. The first thing I'd do is steer him to
the file,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html"><i>Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</i></a>.
It is about the base brain and its cravings for alcohol and tobacco</a>.
<p>

For me, understanding that the little voice in my head that demands
a drink or a smoke IS NOT ME helps a lot. I can see that the 
Addiction Monster has his own agenda, and he will do anything
and everything
he can to get me to smoke and drink, but he is not really me, and
his thoughts are not my thoughts.
<p>
That's important:
<font color="#BF0000">
<b>His thoughts are not my thoughts.</b><br></font>
<p>
Also,
<font color="#BF0000">
His wishes are not necessarily my wishes.
</font>
<p>

Understanding that may not make your husband instantly want to quit,
but if he understands what is really going on in his head, he
may not succumb to the thoughts like,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They are all being so unfair
to me. They are trying to keep me from having a good time.
They want me to give up all of the simple pleasures in life.
Well I won't do it. I refuse to be anyone's slave.&quot;
</font>

<p>
But that's the addictive voice,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin38">the thirsty little frog brain</a>,
talking, and when I listen to it and let it run my life and dictate
my consumption habits, I am most assuredly being somebody else's
slave. Understanding that has been a big help to me, in quitting
and staying quit.
<p>

What else?
Just letting your husband know that he is really hurting himself,
and doesn't have to. For a while, I was sick, and in a deep alcohol-
and tobacco-induced depression, where I thought I would never be
able to quit. I thought just what A.A. teaches, that I was
&quot;powerless over alcohol.&quot; That led me to think that trying to
quit was pointless, I'll just fail anyway, so might as well just
stay stoned until the bitter end comes... When I found out that
I really could control alcohol, rather than vice versa, and also
really control tobacco, that was very empowering and cheery.
So I would do my best to communicate the idea that recovery
(and recovery without a cult) is possible.
Nobody is powerless and the situation is never completely hopeless.
(Well, unless he's dead...)
<p>

I would also just try to keep communicating how much harm alcohol
(and tobacco) are doing. While I was drinking, I could not clearly
see how huge the price tag was. I only saw some of the down side,
and some of the expense and damage. The longer I stay quit, the
clearer my head becomes, and the more I see the rest, and the more
determined I am to not go there again...
<p>

Well, good fortune. (I was tempted to write, good luck, but I don't
think luck has anything to do with it.)
<p>

Don't hesitate to write back. I don't feel like I have all the
answers, but I might have one or two.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
P.S.:<br>
I forgot to mention that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#exponential">the 5% success rate
is <i>per year</i></a>.
That is, 5% will quit this year, and 5% of those who are left
will quit next year, and 5 the next, and so on...
So the odds are better than just one single 1-out-of-20 chance.
<p>
At the same time, there is a one to three percent death rate
happening, so it's a race condition &#8212; quit drinking or die.
Eventually, one way or another, they all quit.
<p>
It's just like a joke a friend used to tell me:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Death is just Mother Nature's way of telling you that it's
time to quit smoking.&quot;
</font>
<p>
The same applies to alcohol, too.

really have any magic bullet to offer her. The facilitator
said,
<font color="black">
&quot;She wants to buy something that will
make her husband quit drinking. If you could put a package like
that together, you'd be a millionaire. All of the wives would
buy it.&quot;

<p>
Alas, yes.
That really seems to be the big problem with the whole
&quot;recovery&quot; industry. They can't make people want to
quit. They pretend that they can, and take people's money,
but then they don't deliver the goods.
And even though I occasionally get accused of being angry,
I have to say that I find that behavior to be contemptible,
and even criminal fraud.

Dear Ag,
<p>

I felt like I wanted to write to you because the vitrol of your
piece against AA is palpable. You seem overly concerned about AA.
Did you try to stop drinking or using drugs and relapse, and now
like many people I have known in the past 19 years, you turn your
self hatred outward to AA and the millions of people who are alive
as a result of it? Clearly you have a bone to pick. 
The other thing I can think that you might be doing is writing for
a project in a college Philosophy class, maybe a thesis? Given the
scope of your work it appears you are interested in scholarship.
Perhaps you might concider the bias you bring to your work as well
as the biases of those you write about. This idea is among the many
logic tools that a mere freshman would hopefully learn. You sound
as if you are young. Is this scenario apt?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, the vitriol is real. If you read the cult test,<br>
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html</a><br>
you will find that I have the same vitriol for Scientology,
the Moonies, the Hari Krishnas, Synanon, Rev. Jim Jones and his People's
Temple, 'David Koresh' and the Branch Davidians, and Marshall
Herff Applewhite and his Heaven's Gate cult.
<p>
And there is a reason for that. I call those groups evil organizations, and I imagine
that you would agree with that. The main reason that I call them
evil is because they hurt people, a lot of people. Even if the
people at Jonestown, Waco, and San Diego had not died, I would still
call The People's Temple, the Branch Davidians, and Heaven's Gate cult
evil organizations for lying to and deceiving people, for wasting
their time and actually keeping them from any activities that might
have really enhanced their spirituality.
<p>

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones">Rev. Jim Jones</a> was
not God and did not perform miracles, like he
claimed. Vernon Howell, a.k.a. David Koresh, was not the Son of God,
obligated to impregnate all of the women and girls in his church to
produce the &quot;Grandchildren of God&quot;, and Marshall Herff Applewhite
was not really teaching his followers how to get to Heaven.
<p>

And Alcoholics Anonymous is not a wonderful organization that has
made millions of alcoholics quit drinking.

<p>
A.A. has too many faults to ignore.
I think I could summarize my gripes against A.A. as:
<p>
<ol>
<li> A.A. is massively dishonest. A.A. lies
about its history, about what Bill Wilson really was and really did,
about the effectiveness of A.A. &quot;treatment&quot;,
and what A.A. is now.
You can go read the <i>&quot;A.A. Lies&quot;</i> web page for
the list, at:<br>
<a href="orange-aalies.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-aalies.html</a><br>
<p>
<li> The A.A. program does not work. The 12 steps are not a formula
for recovery from alcoholism; they are a formula for building a
cult religion.
Professor George Vaillant, a member of the board of trustees of
A.A.W.S., spent 8 years testing A.A. as a treatment program for
alcoholics, and found that it does not work, and in fact raises
the death rate.<br>
See the web page <i>&quot;The Effectiveness of the Twelve
Steps&quot;</i> at:<br>

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html</a><br>
<p>

<li> A.A. is a religious cult, not a self-help group. Read the
cult test:<br>

<a href="orange-cult.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult.html</a><p>

<li> A.A. is using its influence and hidden members to illegally
and immorally force people to join it.
A.A. uses the criminal justice system and the
recovery industry to coerce people into A.A.. <i>The Little Red
Book</i> of Hazelden specifically instructs A.A. members to do
their 12th-step work by:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
11. By telling the A.A. story to clergy members, doctors, judges,
educators, employers, or police officials if we know them well
enough to further the A.A. cause, or to help out a fellow member.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 128.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then that book even goes on to tell recruiters to teach the
judges, police, doctors, and other officials just
<i>what kind of people</i> A.A. wants coerced into attending
its meetings:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By educating doctors, the clergy, judges, police officials, and
industrial personnel regarding the type of people A.A. can help,
we will avoid flooding our ranks with an unwieldy preponderance
of nonalcoholics.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 137.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So much for the lie about how A.A. can't help it if the judges and
parole officers force people to go to A.A. meetings.

<p>
And, before you
protest that Hazelden isn't A.A., and A.A. is not responsible for
what Hazelden does, note the
<i>&quot;eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too&quot;</i>
relationship that A.A. enjoys with its front groups and
satellite organizations: A.A. benefits from the propaganda that
Hazelden publishes, but if anyone criticizes it for things like
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#undercut">
backstabbing and undercutting other religions</a>, then A.A. protests
that A.A. has no control over Hazelden. That is also untrue.
A.A.W.S. has a representative on the board of directors of Hazelden,
and Hazelden is one of the biggest customers of the books that A.A.W.S.
prints. So they are very much in bed together.
And, above all, they are all members of the same 12-step religion,
and they all have the same goal: to grow the cult.

<p>
You, as a Reverend, surely must appreciate the American Constitution that
protects religion from the laws of Congress. Freedom of Religion is
a cornerstone of the American system. But to keep our Freedom of
Religion it is imperative that no religion become state-approved
or state-encouraged, never mind state-enforced. All of the other
religions would lose out, of course. Well, forcing people to go
to A.A. meetings violates that separation of church and state.
<p>
Before you protest that A.A. is not a religion, go read the
&quot;Spiritual, Not Religious&quot; web page at:<br>
<a href="orange-spirrel.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-spirrel.html</a><br>

<p>
Lastly, you asked if I was young, a freshman in college or something.
I guess I should take that as a compliment, because I am really
55 and all gone gray.

I told the woman who was my first sponser in AA that I believed
that AA's were just fascist Christians who were brainwashing me.
She agreed and invited me to think about my current ability to
think and what my great intellect had brought me. What a trick
question that was. This great lady lived her life helping far more
then the 50 women I currently know, save their lives, and go on to
myriad of meaningful careers, lifestyles of value, and mental and
physical health. Would you like more data? Jackie died recently,
sober for 36 years. I wonder if your life work will hold as much
meaning as hers. Her legacy lives in the hearts and lives of so
many many people. She knew the truth. I know the truth. AA is
facist, Christian and uses powerful techniques to save some of the
most miserable lives on the planet, including my own. What a
terrible thing.
<p>

<font color="blue">
The mind game that your sponsor pulled on you is typical:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;You made a mistake once, so your thinking is hopelessly defective.<br>
Stop your stinkin' thinkin'.<br>
Your best thinking got you here.<br>
Just obey my orders.&quot;
</font>
<p>


I know you are just being
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm">
sarcastic</a>, but I don't really find it terribly
funny that you don't take seriously the idea that A.A. <i>really is</i>
a fascist Christian organization.
(Fascists don't really march around wearing Swastika arm-bands any more.)
<p>
Or, if A.A. is not &quot;Christian&quot;, then it is Buchmanite, the
cult religion of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman. It is surely not Buddhist,
Hindu, Moslem, Jewish, American Indian, or atheist.
<p>

I assume that you must have
read the web page about the <i>&quot;Religious Roots of the Twelve
Steps&quot;</i>. I don't know which version. The version on
AAdeprogramming.com is old; please check out:<br>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-rroot030.html</a>
<p>

When Big Brother or Big Sister insists that
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#freedom2think">you are not qualified
to think for yourself</a>, and you need to be bossed around by
someone else, that is a big part of the fascist philosophy.
It is the mortal
enemy of democracy, because democracy believes that people are
qualified to think for themselves and make their own decisions,
and run their own lives, and vote accordingly.
<p>
Just because you made a mistake before,
just because your thinking got messed up and &quot;you tried it
your way&quot;
once, and it didn't work, doesn't mean that you can't learn to
do it right, and still live free, and still think for yourself.

<p>
I have really pondered the question of whether some people
<i>really need</i>,
and would really benefit from, something like a benevolent fascist
cult that would just force them to quit drinking or drugging
and start living healthy.
Alas, all of the evidence shows that the answer is no.
Again and again, all of the fair, unbiased testing that has ever
been done shows no benefits from fascist cults. The truth is that
people quit when they are sick and tired of being sick and tired,
and don't quit before then.

<p>
And, when fascist recovery cults have been tried, like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon">
Synanon</a>, The Seed, or Straight, Inc., or any of its clones,
the results were disastrous. See the web page on
<a href="orange-gulags.html">
Children's Gulags</a>.

<p>

<p>
The lady whom you describe may have been a
great soul who helped a lot of people quit drinking, but they
still quit drinking. That is, <b><i>they</i> quit drinking.</b>
She didn't do it for them.
Everybody has to do it for themselves. You may believe that a tough-love,
highly-disciplined program forces people to quit and saves their
lives, but it doesn't. Again, all of the fair and unbiased testing
that has ever been done shows that such a program does not work.
Go read the page on the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
Effectiveness of A.A.</a> again.
Also read about the
<a href="orange-gulags.html">children's gulags</a>
for stories of children killed by such a
&quot;tough love&quot; approach to recovery.
<p>
Also remember that the Harvard Medical school reported that 80% of
all alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year or more
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">
do it by themselves, alone</a>.
That really brings into question the issue of just how necessary or useful
the A.A. program really is.
<p>
You wish to present me with a list of the 50 people who will
swear that they quit while &#8212; and <i>because of</i> &#8212;
being sponsored by Jackie. That is the standard propaganda stunt
called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote">
&quot;proof by anecdote&quot;</a>.
Everybody, including Scientology, Synanon, and TM, trots out a short
chorus line of poster children whose
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_testimonies">
testimonials</a> &quot;prove&quot;
that their program really does work, and has vastly improved their
lives, and is just the greatest thing since sliced bread.
Unfortunately, it isn't so.
Obviously, someone else could come up with a list of hundreds of
people whom Jackie did not help, but that also proves nothing.

<p>
The fact that she spent years coaching people to quit drinking,
and may even have helped a few to succeed when they might not have
otherwise succeeded is admirable and to be commended, but it
does not prove that A.A. is a good organization, any more than
the activities of Oskar Schindler proved that the Nazi Party was
a good organization. (See the movie, <i>&quot;Schindler's List&quot;</i>.)

<p>
What you witnessed was some people quitting drinking while going to
A.A. meetings, and perhaps also doing the Twelve Steps and
brainwashing themselves into believing that the Twelve Steps actually
make people quit drinking. And
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational">you ignored
all those others who did not successfully quit</a>.
<p>
You <i>came to believe</i> that the Twelve Steps made the quitters quit.
Do you also still believe that the stork brings babies?
<p>
Speaking of which, I used a similar illustration in that
&quot;Effectiveness&quot; web page:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A bunch of people went to a Baptist church for years.<br>
During those years, many of the women got pregnant and had babies.<br>
That proves it: going to Baptist churches causes women to get pregnant
and have babies.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b><i>Not!</i></b><br>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc">
That goofy logic</a> is
the same logic as A.A. uses to insist that it's a proven fact that
going to A.A. meetings and doing the Twelve Steps causes people to
quit drinking.
<p>
Many people will insist that A.A. caused them to quit drinking,
that they could not have done it without A.A.. I always have to
ask, &quot;Which A.A.?&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is different things to different people:
</font>
<p>
<ul>
<li> For some people, it is a circle of friends who hold your
hand and give you moral support, and cheer you on, and give you
little coins at each milestone of sobriety, like 3 months, 6, 9,
a year... That is good
stuff, I heartily recommend it. (At least, it isn't likely to hurt.)
<p>
<li> For other people, A.A. is a system of pop psychology, transmitted
in slogans:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Easy does it.
<li> Live and Let Live.
<li> Resign from the debating society.
<li> Just don't take that first drink.
<li> Just don't drink, no matter what.
</ul>
<p>
That isn't too bad, as long as you stay away from the
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#slogan_list">
vicious negative slogans</a>,
and it can be very helpful to some people.<br>
That
<font color="blue">
<b><i>&quot;Just Don't Take That First Drink&quot;</i></b></font> rule is so good
that if you just follow that one rule, you won't need any others,
and you won't need any twelve steps or any Wilsonism cult religion.
<p>

<li> For some people, A.A. is a collection of helpful home-spun
simple wisdom, like &quot;Well, bad as it is, you still don't have to
drink over it.&quot;

<p>
<li> And for some other people, A.A. is a
<a href="orange-cult.html">mind-controlling religious cult</a> with some
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality">very strange theology</a>
and lots of misinformation.
It features intense indoctrination bordering on brainwashing,
deep immersion (90 meetings in 90 days), ego-destruction through
self-criticism and confession sessions,
guilt induction, wallowing in guilt, shame and self-contempt, suppression
of your feelings, pretending to get positive results
(<i>&quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;</i>),
and confessions of powerlessness,
insanity, sinfulness, selfishness, resentments, and many other things.
That can be very harmful. It has even driven some people to suicide.
</ul>
<p>
</font>


<p>

Please feel free to rip at my sentence structures, identify my
fallacies, and gleefully and sarcastically point out my lack of
intellectual understanding of what was presented to me.

<p>

<font color="blue">
Such sarcasm is unnecessary. When did I ever criticize your grammar?
</font>
<p>


Frankly, I
am going to bed and sleep well knowing that when you are ready
there is a chair waiting for you among all of those hopelessly
possessed minions of the false prophets of AA. When you have lost
more of your heart, developed an even greater spectrum and
rationale for your anger, when most people find you a bore (no
matter how clever and funny you think you are), and your compassion
for others is matured through humiliation, the people of AA will
not reject you. You may need them. Until then...
<p>
Blessings,
<br>
Reverend Allyson K. D.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That's quite some blessing. It sounds more like a Gypsy curse.
What church are you a Reverend of?
<p>

By the way, I'm not bitter, I'm not unhappy, and I am not
lacking in friends. And I'm also not drinking.
<p>
And I give whatever help or moral support I can to anyone who is
working on quitting. But I never claim that I made someone quit,
or even &quot;helped them quit.&quot; I don't want to steal other
people's thunder. They do the quitting, and I cheer for them.<br>
(It's always the same old truth: &quot;Nobody holds your hand
every Saturday night but you.&quot;)
<p>
And, I don't go to A.A. meetings, I don't have a sponsor, and I don't
do the Twelve Steps of William Griffith Wilson.
<p>
I work for free, telling people the truth as I see it about the whole
recovery cult problem.
I even tell

<p>
The &quot;<a href="orange-coffee.html">Hazelden Coffee War</a>&quot;
was hilarious! Other Hazelden wars are not so funny.

<p>
In recent news releases, Hazelden Foundation researcher Carol
Falkowski condemned the FDA approval of GHB to treat cataplexy, which
is the most debilitating symptom of narcolepsy. Ms. Falkowski's
campaign to reverse the approval of GHB betrays more than two hundred
thousand U.S. narcoleptics who have waited decades for an effective
cataplexy drug. Like many others narcoleptics, I have been denied
employment, health insurance, and most other aspects of a &quot;normal&quot;
lifestyle for over twenty years.

<p>
Ms. Falkowski is concerned that American teenagers will abuse GHB.
Since GHB will be released as a tightly controlled Schedule-I drug,
her concern seems focused on a renegade minority of American teens,
the same minority subculture that dominates crime statistics and has
made a mockery of legislated countermeasures to substance abuse.
Pathetically, Ms. Falkowski seems unconcerned about folks like me. I
may collapse twenty times a day from cataplexy - twenty unpredictable
and total collapses, lasting from 30 seconds to 10 minutes, but each
episode seems like an eternity when your voluntary muscle system shuts
down while panicked onlookers gather around your limp body.

<p>
This scenario may resemble what occurs when a shopping-mall crowd
gathers around an overdosed drug abuser. The difference is that one
victim knowingly broke the law, probably in more ways then one, while
the other victim prays for any miracle that will enable him/her to
rejoin productive society. Ms. Falkowski's empathy for drug abusers
and callous disregard for narcoleptics is analogous to characterizing
Nazis as &quot;victims&quot; of the Nuremberg Trials and dismissing the
Holocaust as a tragic footnote in history.

<p>
Furthermore, with respect to GHB, Ms. Falkowski exhibits more passion
than knowledge. GHB is not new or rare. For many years, GHB has been
an ingredient in several common industrial compounds. This, in part,
explains why the illegal drug culture gained easy access to GHB long
before FDA approval. In the big picture, FDA approval of GHB will
legally channel insignificant quantities of GHB to narcolepsy victims.
Reversing GHB approval will not deter illegal drug producers or
disrupt underground supply channels to drug abusers. Unless she is a
novice researcher, Falkowski ought to know that her campaign to ban
medicinal GHB is a prophylactic measure that will help few but hurt
many. Very few drug abusers will even be inconvenienced, but all
narcolepsy victims will be forced to suffocate inside Falkowski's
useless condom.

<p>
Experience is a great teacher if we listen. Several years ago, asthma
and narcolepsy patients were victimized when ephedrine became the
target of &quot;drug abuse professionals&quot; like Ms. Falkowski.
The efficacy
of ephedrine as a treatment for mild asthma symptoms has never been
disputed. Ephedrine dilates bronchial passages, accelerates
metabolism, and has relatively few contraindications. Ephedrine is
still the primary active ingredient in over-the-counter remedies for
asthma symptoms. However, for many years, clinical grade ephedrine
was also available without prescription at commodity-like prices.
Because ephedrine was cheap and available, it effectively regulated
the price of brand name remedies for asthma symptoms.

<p>
In order to combat involuntary sleep attacks, narcolepsy patients also
used ephedrine because it was inexpensive, and the side-effects are
negligible compared to Ritalin, Desoxyn, and other prescription speed
drugs. Many narcoleptics preferred ephedrine simply because the
buzz-saw-like side effects of Ritalin and the amphetamines were nearly
as intolerable as the sleep attacks. All of these benefits
disappeared when misguided social campaigners persuaded lawmakers that
methamphetamine abuse could be controlled by restricting the legal
distribution of ephedrine. Quite predictably, drug company lobbyists
succeeded in protecting their brand names while unadulterated
ephedrine was reclassified as a controlled substance and a
prescription drug.

<p>
The consequences of this reclassification were many, but none of them
curtailed methamphetamine abuse. Illegal &quot;meth labs&quot; propagate so
easily that vigorous police enforcement efforts have been unable to
measurably interdict supply or inflate the street price of
methamphetamine. Meanwhile, the price of legal ephedrine skyrocketed.
Before reclassification, the price of a 20mg tablet was less than a
dime. As a prescription drug, the same ephedrine tablet costs more
than a dollar, and drug companies quickly seized upon their
opportunity to drastically inflate the price of their unregulated
asthma remedies. As a result, over-the-counter consumers are being
gouged, and the price of ephedrine by prescription is beyond the means
of many who need it most: victims of poverty and senior citizens on
fixed incomes.

<a name="Talbott"> </a>
<p>
I do not know who you are but the above web page was very well done.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
[Orange: I think he must be referring to the
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Talbott"><i>&quot;Dr. Harry Tiebout,
Fascist doctor&quot;</i></a> web page. There is a short mention of the
abuses of Dr. G. Douglas Talbott at the bottom.
Either that, or it's the reference to Talbott in
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">the discussion of
Professor Vaillant's writings</a> in the page on the effectiveness of
12-step treatment.]<br>
</font>

No doubt you have seen Peele's reference, I was a witness at this trial and
hoped that the trial would help put an end to these abuses...:
<p>

In May, 1999, just after Talbott stepped down as president of ASAM, a jury
awarded Dr. Leonard Masters, of Jacksonville Florida, a judgment of $1.3
million against Talbott, his daughter-in-law Morrison, and other Talbott
associates for malpractice, fraud, and false imprisonment, based on Masters'
stay with Talbott in 1994. Testifying at Masters' trial that he was not in
fact alcohol dependent, as he had been diagnosed by Talbott et al., was Anne
Geller, the president of ASAM prior to Talbott. Talbott's attorneys quickly
settled with the plaintiff before the jury decided on punitive damages
against Talbott and his colleagues (an amount which is usually a multiple of
the compensatory damages that had already been awarded).
<p>

Despite this legal setback, Talbott has faced no professional repercussions.
Indeed, the ASAM has neglected to discuss the case at all in the year since
the Masters' decision in its newsletter or at its Web site. And ASAM and
Talbott continue to bask in their roles as the premier medical advocates for
and caretakers of addicted individuals.
<p>

What you will not get from the news reports is that the judge was so
impressed with Talbott's ability to intimidate those who testified against
him that:
<ol>
<li> No witnesses were sworn in by name!
Witnesses were introduced as &quot;the doctor from Pennsylvania&quot;
or the &quot;veterinarian from North Carolina&quot;!
Thats all... no name. Sometimes the
doctor's wives got to testify to confirm the threats made to the families.
<li> After the trial the trial transcripts were &quot;sealed&quot;. Perhaps to protect
the witnesses, but this move, unfortunately, also protects the public from
ever knowing the abuses that the witnesses spelled out to the jury.
</ol>
<p>
Want a photo of the T shirt they sold at TMRC? The joke was that it
says &quot;I'm only here for a four day evaluation&quot;
Everyone was encouraged to buy
one... perhaps as a symbol of submission.
In fact almost no one left TMRC in
less than 4 months (not days)
<p>

I began to research the effects of incarceration there and came across the
paper listing ten ways cults add influence to their brainwashing. I'm sure
that paper, and that list of techniques, was a key tool for Master's
attorneys.
<p>

Hopefully your web page information will spread and save others much grief.
<p>

I have never read such an in depth review of the AA Big Book. It
scares the hell out of me. I am a member of AA and I tell you that
I too have had so many of the same thoughts and analogies as you
describe in your text. But I'm really at a loss. I know there are
other treatments out there but, of course AA is the cheapest and
most accessible for most people. I got sober back in November of
2000 in AA and started other activities in my life. I found very
quickly that I had out grown AA but I was concerned about new
members and the Nazi techniques that some of the &quot;old timers&quot; used
on them. I began to openly admit in meetings that I DID NOT want
what most of the &quot;old timers&quot; had and was not willing to go to
their described lengths to get it. I told them that I had to grow
in my own way. I do really love some of the people at AA meetings
though and a lot of them gravitate toward me because I am so open
and brazen about the so called &quot;AA Philosophy&quot;. Most of the new
comers really need someone just to listen to them and show some
understanding for their fucked up life style. I do understand it
and also know that if I allow myself to grown spiritually (outside
the program) I get happier and healthier everyday. I know this
makes me sound like a hypocrite but I believe that the new comers
deserve something better than an indoctrination into the Nazi style
Philosophy that the &quot;old timers&quot; preach. Man, thank you for your
research and the immense amount of time it must have taken to put
this study together. I'm not going to go to a meeting and just try
and tear apart everything that has been built in my home group but
you have given me so much insight into the program that now I am
better prepared to combat the constant verbiage recited from the
Big Book. I do want to continue to help alcoholics and your paper
has given me some knowledge and courage to continue to do that.

Hi. My first reaction is that there *are* other self-help
organizations for free: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a>, and WFS/MFS, that I know of.<br>
Maybe I should explain the acronyms:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> = Self-Management and Recovery Training<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a> = Secular Organizations for Sobriety<br>
WFS = Women for Sobriety<br>
MFS = Men for Sobriety<br>
<p>

Of the four, the only one I've been able to attend is
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>, because it's the only one in this town. But I've
heard good things about the others.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> is sort of what you might get if you took A.A. and
kept the fellowship but threw away Bill Wilson, the cult
religion, and the illogical nonsense.
<p>
I don't think your remarks are hypocritical. I too believe
in some kind of spirituality, although it is very difficult
to define. It's sort of like the judge who ruled on &quot;art&quot; by saying,
&quot;I can't tell you what it is, but I know it when I see it.&quot;
<p>

One of the few things that I am pretty sure about is that
spirituality is not people parroting illogical cult religion
slogans... :-)
<p>

You might find that some <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> meetings could help just to
lower the feelings of frustration. One of the commonest
reactions people have when they first attend <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> meetings is
great relief to get away from the atmosphere of only being
able to say the &quot;right&quot; things...
<p>

The URL for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> is: &nbsp;
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">

times and places of meetings.
<p>

so you can find at least one of the four in more and more towns.

Have a good day, and enjoy your sobriety. I sure am enjoying mine.
A.A. or no A.A., life is still better when you aren't sick,

P.S.:<br>
One other thing: when you are going to meetings like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>,
you will find that meetings have personalities, just like how
different A.A. meetings have different personalities. If you don't like
the first one you visit, definitely try others.
<p>
In this town, there are 3 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> meetings close to me, and they are
very different from each other. One is run by a college professor
and is stiff and formal. Another is run by some graduate students,
and while they are nice kids, I just never sort of &quot;click&quot;
there. Maybe it's just age-ism on my part; I have a hard time taking
some kids seriously when they've never been dopers or drunks, and
I could be older than their father...
But the third meeting is perfect: One visiting facilitator called
it &quot;the wackiest ship in the Navy&quot;, definitely the loosest
and most informal, unstructured meeting in the city.
So anyway, that's what appeals to me. But other people have other
tastes... It's all okay. So anyway, don't hesitate to shop around,
and don't assume that if you've seen one meeting, that you've
seen them all.

I just finished reading your articles on the AA 
deprogramming site... well done.
<p>

I especially liked '<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy Of The
12 Steps</a>.' It reminded me of
William J. Murray. Mr. Murray, by the way, is a prominent Christian
evangelist. He is also the oldest son of the late Madeline Murray
O'Hair, the atheist activist. 
<p>

Prior to his Christian conversion, William Murray was a world-class
boozer. He began attending AA meetings. However, the experience made him
ask himself; what god DO I worship? He did the smart thing; he abandoned
AA. At last report, he still doesn't drink.
<p>

I'm not trying to convert you to evangelical Christianity; i'm not one
myself. I thought you might find his story interesting, though.
<p>

Well, that's all. Write more articles, if you would;
I'll read them-bye.
<p>

Jim

<blockquote>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">
"... in ancient times material 
progress was painfully slow. The spirit of modern scientific inquiry, research 
and invention was almost unknown. In vthe realm of the material, men's minds were 
fettered by superstition, tradition, and all sorts of fixed ideas. Some of the 
contemporaries of Columbus thought a round earth preposterous. Others came near 
putting Galileo to death for his astronomical 
heresies.
<br>
&quot;We asked ourselves this: 
Are not some of us just as biased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit 
as were the ancients about the realm of the material?&quot;<br>
</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">
In the first paragraph, Bill 
Wilson points out that superstition, tradition, and fixed ideas were at 
fault for rejecting the logic of two skeptics who based their conclusions 
on the evaluation of hard data.  He then implies, therefore, that 
skeptics are at fault for rejecting superstition, tradition, and fixed ideas 
(and most of all, his totally unscientific 
personal philosophy).   The syllogism (I think that is what it's 
called) would be:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">Non scientific thinking 
  rejected skeptical thinking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">Non scientific thinking 
  was incorrect.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">Skeptical thinking rejects 
  Non scientific thinking.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">Skeptical thinking is 
  therefore incorrect.</font></li></ul>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">And so, on it goes with 
the first 150 some pages of philosophical rambling and sloppy thinking of 
the Big Book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">
The chapter on &quot;We Agnostics&quot; 
is especially illogical.  Wilson makes reference to some scientific 
theories (in an attempt to make a stronger appeal to skeptics), but totally 
butchers the theories with suggestions of electrons having some sort of 
intelligent knowledge of what they are doing, and the self evidence of a prime 
mover.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">The chapter title implies 
that he was once an agnostic; a title for which he never qualified.  Most 
AA members have a strong predisposition to religious ideas, and it is doubtful 
that more than a handful were ever truly agnostic.  It is even more 
likely that a smaller percentage still could be labeled skeptics (skeptics being 
defined as those who reject beliefs based on the lack of evidence).</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">We Agnostics ends 
up as a patronizing attempt by Wilson to imply he understands 
the logical thought process of true skepticism or agnosticism. As a 
result, it is an insult to the very people he is trying to reach, and 
had he comprehended the depth of his lack of understanding of skepticism, 
agnosticism, and the scientific method, it would have been an embarrassment 
to himself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">Sincerely,</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">Dave</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="black" size="4">
P.S.:<br>
You said: The AA group is obviously a social group...
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">The AA phenomenon is indeed perplexing. I've 
come to the conclusion that its success (success meaning it's popularity and 
longevity) has more to do with its social and quasi-religious aspects than with 
alcohol&nbsp;treatment. It's true that it does provide a helpful support 
group for those wanting to quit drinking, but I tend to see that as a 
somewhat secondary function. Of course, it is never stated that way, 
but in reality, the social and religious aspects are the drawing card 
that keep bringing people back.</font>
<p>

<font face="Arial" size="4">The negative side of this is that the social and 
religious aspects tend to obscure and neglect the more important issue of 
alcohol treatment. While not so stated, the focus is wrong. Alcohol 
treatment should be the primary concern. The problem is that 
AA claims that its purpose is alcohol treatment, but in reality it 
gets sidetracked.

Greetings-
<p>

I stumbled upon your web page and just thought I'd send you a note saying 
that if you really understood the effectiveness of humbling yourself and 
realizing that there are characteristics of one's personality that only serve 
the ego you might understand what the twelve steps are about.  I can't attest 
to the use of the twelve steps by any other group but AA, but it doesn't 
really sound plausible that any group purported to help victims of crimes 
would place blame upon the victim.  But I can see where victims might carry 
around feelings of shame or anger that could very well be effecting their 
ability to carry on useful and prosperous lives.  And frankly, that's what I 
understand the purpose of the twelve steps to be;  To give me the opportunity 
to confront and release those attitudes I hold that are getting in the way of 
my living a happy and useful life.  And wouldn't you agree that even incest 
survivors want to live happy and useful lives instead of living in the shadow 
of what happened to them.  To move beyond the pain and have some joy in their 
lives?  I encourage you to sit down and read the text book "Alcoholics 
Anonymous"; at least the Roman numeral pages and the first 164 regularly 
numbered pages of the book.
<p>

Take Care<br>
Steve
<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello, Steve,
<p>
Your first mistake is the line,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;there are characteristics of one's personality that only serve 
the ego...&quot;</font>
<p>

Who says that the ego is bad? (Besides Bill Wilson and most
cults.)
Who says that we must renounce ego and self?
Cults and renunciate religions. But is that good?
<p>
We have long been taught that it is holy to mumble masochistic,
grovelling prayers like
those of St. Francis of Assisi or
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#prayer3">
Bill Wilson's Third Step Prayer</a>...
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Lord, make me an instrument of
Thy will... Free me from the bondage of Self...&quot;
</font>
But does that really do us any good? Does it work?

<p>
The whole idea that renunciate religions produce saints is open to
question and debate. I just read
<i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power</i>, by Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad.
It is quite revealing, quite good. One of the big points that they make
is that renunciate religions began with the Upanishads in India about
3000 years ago, and the idea has continued in Buddhism and Hinduism,
(and to some extent in Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam,) and in all of those millennia, they have not made India
any more peaceful or spiritual,
or any less self-seeking, than non-renunciate societies.
In fact, the bitter squabbling between India and Pakistan, both
of whom have renunciate religions, threatens us with nuclear war.
Likewise, the renunciate Moslems and Jews in Israel and Palestine haven't
been enjoying any renunciate peace lately either, have they?
(Did you know that even the word <i>Islam</i> means &quot;surrender&quot;?)
Some of the true believers are so renunciate &#8212; they
surrender to the will of God so much &#8212; that they even renounce
their very lives, as well as their egos, and become suicide bombers.
(Remember September 11.)
<p>
So just how good are the philosophies and religions that tell us that
we must renounce ego and surrender to the Will of God?

<p>
Likewise, the Church that produced St. Francis of Assisi
also produced priests who burned millions
of girls as witches, guys as heretics, and Jews as Jews.
So where are the benefits of thousands of years of hating and
denouncing ego?
Jesus Christ said that you will know a tree by the fruit that it bears.
Where is the sweet fruit of renouncing ego?
For every Mother Teresa living a saintly renunciate life of service,
we have hundreds of priests molesting the alterboys and burning the girls
at the stake (and then feeling guilty about it, and confessing it, and
then going and doing it all again)...

<p>
Personally, I feel a lot safer when surrounded by hedonists
with healthy egos and libidos, normal non-renunciate people who just
want to get high and get laid.

<p>
Now I am not recommending that everyone suddenly turn into an arrogant
ego-maniac like Bill Wilson. But after considering the situation carefully
for a lot of years, including spending many years working on
getting rid of ego
myself, I find the constant demands of many churches and
cults that we erase ego and get rid of
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#erase_self">self, selfishness, and
self-seeking</a>&quot; to be just another cult mind game designed
to oppress people and turn them into slaves of the cult.
See <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult"><i>Surrender To
The Cult</i></a>,
and
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_perfection"><i>Demands for Superhuman
Perfection</i></a>.

<p>
Now I know full well that you can get a temporary rush,
a temporary feeling of inner peace and serenity, from pretending
that you have rid yourself of ego and surrendered to the Will of God.
But it does not work for long. Reality intrudes again.
Like water seeking its own level, people return to their own versions
of normalcy, and the self-deluded people find themselves back in the
real world, with all of their usual problems, again.
And then, often, they become discouraged and relapse.
<p>
And I also know that it is possible, while in deep meditation,
if you are skilled and lucky (maybe blessed), and if the time
is right, to
put yourself into a state where you are truly ego-free for a short period
of time. It is a wonderful, life-transforming experience.
But you do not and will not get that experience from grovelling in
a cult, wallowing in guilt, and yammering about how you have to get
rid of ego. That simply never works.

<p>
And alas,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
the real purpose of the 12 steps</a> is to convert
you into a good subservient member of Frank Buchman's fascist cult religion.
The Twelve Steps are
<a href="orange-interpreted.html">a formula for building a
cult religion like Buchmanism</a>,
not a formula for spirituality, and not a
formula for quitting drinking.
<p>
You said,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;it doesn't really sound plausible that any group purported to
help victims of crimes would place blame upon the victim.&quot;<br>
</font>
It may not sound plausible, but that's what Bill Wilson did.
And it's because A.A. is a cult, not a self-help group.
Page 58 of the <i>Big Book</i> clearly says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our
path. Those who do not recover are those who cannot or will not give
themselves completely to this simple program, usually men and women
who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.
There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have
been born that way.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Groups actually habitually read that lie out loud at the start of every meeting,
blaming the victims of a non-functional, ineffective, treatment program right
at the start, before anybody can even say anything else.<br>
And they also say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The program never fails anyone; people just fail the program.&quot;<br>
</font>
And,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The program is perfect. It's just the fellowship that is imperfect.&quot;
</font>
<p>
A.A. is non-stop 'blame the victim'. If someone succeeds in quitting drinking,
A.A. takes all of the credit, and says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;See how good the program is!
See how well the Twelve Steps work!&quot;<br>
</font>
But if someone relapses (which is what usually happens), then the alcoholic
gets all of the blame for the failure. The true believers start yammering about
how he must have held something back in his fifth step or something...
None of them will say,
<font color="#bf005f">
&quot;Hmmm... Maybe the 12 steps don't really work...&quot;<br>
</font>
A.A. is playing &quot;Heads I win, tails you lose&quot; with people's lives.

<p>
You wrote,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
And frankly, that's what I understand the purpose of the twelve steps
to be; To give me the opportunity to confront and release those attitudes
I hold that are getting in the way of my living a happy and useful life.
And wouldn't you agree that even incest survivors want to live happy
and useful lives instead of living in the shadow of what happened to them.
To move beyond the pain and have some joy in their lives?
</font>
<p>
The Twelve Steps are a formula for changing (controlling) people's minds
and converting them into cult members. The goals of the Steps are:
<ol>
<li> To induce feelings of powerlessness, helplessness, incompetence,
and weakness. This is particularly accomplished by Steps 1 and 2:<br>
You must admit that you are powerless over alcohol,
and you can't manage your own life.<br>
You are insane, and only God can restore you to sanity.
<li> To induce feelings of shame and guilt by making people constantly
list and confess all of their
sins, &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
(in Steps 4 through 10), which
leads to:
<li> Surrender to the cult. Step Three: We turned our wills and our lives over to
&quot;God <i>as we understood Him</i>&quot;.
And Bill Wilson added the note that you can surrender
to the A.A. group if you don't want to surrender to a
supernatural &quot;Higher Power.&quot; That is
<i><a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">Surrender to the Cult</a></i>,
pure and simple.
</ol>
The story that the steps are somehow supposed to make people able to &quot;live
happy and useful lives&quot; is a lie, period. The Twelve Steps won't do
that for you any more than practicing the weird psycho-babble nonsense of Scientology
will &quot;restore you to sanity&quot; and make you immortal.
The Twelve Steps are not a therapeutic program.
<p>
(By 1950, after 15 years of &quot;working the steps&quot;, Bill Wilson was in the
middle of an 11-year-long case of crippling chronic clinical depression so bad that
all he did was sit in his office and hold his head in his hands all day long. &#8212; Or not
even bother getting out of bed at all &#8212; just lay in bed and stare at the ceiling all day.
Ironically, that is when Bill Wilson,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP">with the help of Tom P.</a>,
wrote his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
which Wilson said was a book that would tell people how to be happy.
What a pathetic, tragic, joke.)

<p>
Lastly, you say:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I encourage you to sit down and read the text book
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;; at least the Roman numeral
pages and the first 164 regularly numbered pages of the book.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Why is it that so many true believers seem to be completely incapable of
seeing that I have <b><i>heavily</i></b> quoted the <i>Big Book</i> in my
web pages, especially the first 164 pages?
Is there something the matter with their eyes?
(Unless they just don't even look at my pages before
they start criticizing my writing, which is what I suspect is going on...)
<p>
I feel like I've typed half of the first 164 pages myself.
I have most assuredly read them, and reread them, and then dissected
them, and then typed big chunks of them into my web pages,
and then discussed them, and criticized them...
<p>
And then I still get these suggestions that I should read the first 164
pages &quot;to find out what it's all about.&quot;
<p>
Do you believe that what is in those pages is so brilliant and magical
that if you
could only just get people to read them, that people would be instantly
converted into True Believers in Wilsonism?
<p>
I have read and reread the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i>,
and have found them to be some
of the stupidest, most brain-damaged and dishonest literature in the
English language. Read my web pages on
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html">propaganda techniques</a>,

<li> <a href="orange-recruit.html">recruiting tricks</a>,

<li> <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">The Funny Spirituality

<li> <a href="orange-religious_faith.html">A.A. and Religious Faith</a>,

<li> and <a href="orange-bait-switch.html">The Bait-and-Switch Con
Game</a>,
</ul>

for some criticisms of what's in those first 164 pages.

<p>
Oh, and
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a> has a lot to say
about them, too.

Just wanted to tell you that I've enjoyed your essays on the AAdeprogramming 
site. My ex husband is an AA cult fanatic and so fat he doesn't seem to be 
determined to live like the derilict ex drunks he now has for 
&quot;friends&quot;. He is a prime example of AA as the great
enabler, enabling him to avoid the real world and getting a real life. 
<p>
One correction that I would like to make however is regarding ol' wet 
brain Bill W's experiences with LSD. He thought it was VERY useful for the 
treatment of alcoholism but it was considered too controversial. He stopped 
experimenting with it when he feared a bad reputation. A shame
too because he 
might have taken enough to think he could fly and jumped out a window thus 
making a mockery of his religion. 
<p>
Thanks Again,<br>

<pre>
&gt; So what is the answer? I went to AA and I am now wondering what is
&gt; the answer?
&gt; Teena
&gt; 
</pre>
<p>

<p><font color="blue">
At the risk of saying something really stupid, I would ask,
&quot;What is the problem?&quot;
<p>

If you mean that you are having a problem with drinking too
much alcohol, then the answer is to stop doing it.
<p>

Almost any means of achieving that goal is okay, short of
grossly illegal or immoral means.
<p>

The whole idea behind the &quot;recovery movement&quot; is bogus.<br>
They hint that they will make you stop drinking, or make you want to stop.<br>
They cannot do either.<br>
Only you can quit, and only you can want to quit.<br>
You will quit when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired.<br>
You will quit and stay quit when you
become totally convinced that you cannot drink even a little
bit because it just starts you back down that slippery slope
again.
<p>

Now something that breaks the routine can help. Going camping
in the mountains, 20 miles from the nearest source of alcohol,
for instance, may work for some people.
But if you are badly addicted, then detox is necessary.
<p>

And hanging out with other people who are quitting, or have quit,
may help
some people to quit and stay quit. You might like the company
of the people you find at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160418094033/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a>, or WFS/MFS. Or you
might even like some A.A. people, if you can find some who
are not intent on shoving cult religion down your throat.
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
[One other thing that helps me is watching the tricks that
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">the Lizard Brain</a> tries to pull
on me to get me to relapse.]
</font>
<p>

But the real answer is that there is no answer. That is, there
is no panacea. There is no magic one-size-fits-all cure.
That is the myth that A.A. has been pushing for 60 years,
and it is simply not true. Cult religion and becoming a
religiomaniac never was the answer.
<p>

Good luck. Don't hesitate to email again if you wish.

Whether you want to accept it or not, AA works best for most.
Bill Wilson was hardly a religous man. He was a stockbroker on the

track. Religion was not in the picture.

<p><font color="blue">

not a stock broker</a>, either &#8212; that was another one of

</font>
<p>
Religion was huge in the picture:
<ul>
<li> Didn't you read
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot030.html">The Religious
Roots of the Twelve Steps</a>&quot;? The Oxford Group cult converted him.
<li> Read &quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">A.A. and Religious
Faith</a>&quot; to see what they did to his mind.
<li> Heck, even just read the fourth chapter of the
<i>Big Book</i>, <i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i>, where Wilson raves about
how we must all
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason">abandon Reason</a>
and human intelligence, and just &quot;have faith&quot;.
<li> Also read the second chapter where Wilson generously announced that
<a href="orange-recruit.html#acquire_faith">A.A. was not the <i>only</i>
way to &quot;acquire faith&quot;</a>. &#8212; Which means
that the goal of the A.A. program is to acquire faith.
<li> Read the appendix to the second through fourth editions of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#appendixII">
Appendix II, &quot;Spiritual Experience&quot;</a>, (page 569 of the 3rd edition),
where Bill Wilson
declared that the goal of the A.A. program is to induce religious experiences
so intense that they will permanently change the personality of the alcoholic
and make him quit drinking forever.
<li> For that matter, read just about any of the much-ballyhooed
&quot;first 164 pages&quot; and look at all of the talk about God
and how God will solve all of your problems, provided you become a
slave of God. That's religion. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters come
to mind as being particularly obnoxious.
<li> Further on in the <i>Big Book</i> we find:<br>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</ul>

<p>

But he had a problem with alcohol that he could not solve on his own.

<p><font color="blue">
Actually, he did solve it on his own. He had already decided to
quit drinking before he went to Towns Hospital for the last time.
That's why he took Ebby Thacher's suggestion and went to
Sam Shoemaker's Calvary House mission where he
&quot;gave himself to God.&quot;
And that's why he then went to Towns Hospital where he got Dr.
Silkworth's <i>Belladonna Cure</i>.
I'm sure that the DT's and belladonna helped to warp his mind, as
did the Oxford Group members who indoctrinated him while he was
stoned and hallucinating, but he still did the quitting and the
staying quit himself. And he
did it without the Twelve Steps, which he didn't write until
4 years later.
</font><p>

I glad that you were able to do that. Some can. But most can't.
9 out of 10 never make it.  I assume thats the 90 to 95% you
refer to. But those are not the numbers for people who make it to AA.


<p><font color="blue">
Wrong again. The Harvard Medical School says that more than 50% of all
alcoholics eventually
quit, and 80% of those successful quitters do it

You refer to the 12 steps. I suggest that you read the 12
traditions.

<p><font color="blue">
I've read them, many times. I even own a copy of <i>Twelve Steps
and Twelve Traditions</i> (and criticize it in the
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">Us Stupid Drunks</a>&quot;
web page).
I've also read Mitchell K.'s essays on
<!-- a href="http://alcoholism.about.com/health/alcoholism/library/blmitch12.htm" -->
alcoholism.about.com</a> about how the current organization is not
following the traditions.<br>

Go to the file
&quot;<a href="orange-not_good.html#MitchellK_list">What's Not Good
About A.A</a>.&quot;,
and about 1/4
of the way down the file, you will find a set of links, under
the item about
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AA_dishonest">the gross dishonesty
of A.A.</a>, which also discusses violations of some of the traditions.

You will see that you are way off the mark.
Moreover, you are doing a real dis-service to many people who are
trying to get sober.
<p>

Bob W. MD<br>
Proud member of AA<br>

<p><font color="blue">
No, I'm not. A.A. is doing a great disservice to those
people. Read about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">the effectiveness of the 12-step treatment</a>.
Read what 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School says</a>.
<p>
And even the G.S.O. (General Service Organization) of Alcoholics Anonymous
reports that they have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">
greater than a 95% dropout and failure rate</a>.
(You say you're a doctor &#8212; can you imagine the FDA approving <i>any</i>
treatment program that has more than a 95% failure rate on the
intended patients?)
<p>
Even Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University,
who is also a member of the Board
of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., proved with
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">his own research</a> that
A.A. doesn't work, and doesn't help alcoholics at all.
After 8 years of testing A.A. on his patients, Dr. Vaillant wrote:
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of
alcoholism, but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.&quot;<br>
</font>
&#8212; Really appalling. After 8 years, 29% of his A.A.-treated patients were dead.

<p>
So it is A.A. that is wasting people's time with cult religion,
and doing them a gross disservice by giving them a lot of misinformation
and voodoo medicine that does not work.
A.A.'s insistence that it is the best or only way to recover from alcoholism
is hurting people and keeping them from other things that might work
better.
<p>

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">Read the file</a>.
<p>

Again, forcing cult religion on people is not helping them.<br>
And yes, it really is a cult religion.<br>
<ul>
<li> Read <a href="orange-cult.html">the cult test</a>.<br>
<li> Also read the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html">Spiritual, Not Religious</a>.&quot;
<li> And read the fourth chapter of the <i>Big Book</i> where
Bill Wilson raved about how
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason">
we must all become crazy true believers
without &quot;Reason&quot;</a>, just like him.
</ul>

[ 2nd letter from Robert W.: ]
<p>
I have no idea why you have such strong opinions about AA.
What happened to you?

<p><font color="blue">
What happened to me is what you read in
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>:
I saw a bunch of true-believer Twelve-Steppers illegally and
immorally using public tax money and health insurance money to
foist their cult religion on a lot of people who were seeking
some kind of genuine help to save their lives.
</font><p>

It does not matter whether your research is correct or not.

<p><font color="blue">
It matters a lot. Only in a cult religion is the difference
between the truth and a lie considered a minor, unimportant,
trivial detail.
</font><p>

The people who find that AA works for them are very happy, and they
do not feel like they are &quot;in a cult&quot; If other people get
sober on their own that is great. Whatever works.

<p><font color="blue">
Does that mean that it is also okay for Scientology to take public
tax money and health insurance money to &quot;fix&quot; alcoholics' and
drug addicts' minds the *Scientology* way? (You are aware, aren't you, that
Scientology has a branch called &quot;Narconon&quot; that supposedly uses
Scientology &quot;principles&quot; to cure drug and alcohol addiction?)

And if the newly-brainwashed
members of Scientology happily declare that they really like Scientology
now, does that make it all okay?
<p>
Should we then instruct the parole officers, judges and counselors to
start forcing people to go to Scientology offices to get audited,
and to get their minds processed into new &quot;Operating Thetans&quot;?

<p>
How about Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his gang of Moonies?
Can they go into the business of faith-based &quot;recovery
treatment&quot; at public expense?<br>
The Hari Krishnas?<br>
Transcendental Meditation?
<p>
For that matter then, when is cult religion not okay?<br>
Only when they commit mass suicide?
<p>
Should we declare that it is now okay for any cult to take
public tax money and health insurance money to indoctrinate
and brainwash people into being true believers in their religions?
(All done, of course, in the name of drug and alcohol rehab.)
</font><p>

I do not try and recruit other people &quot;into the cult&quot;. I simply
state that this is what worked for me. 

<p><font color="blue">
I would question &quot;what worked&quot;, and suggest that you are confusing cause
and effect with things like
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">correlation or coincidence</a>.

It's the &quot;women getting pregnant because they went to the
Baptist church&quot; again. Have you read the file on

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
The Effectiveness of the Twelve Steps</a> yet?
