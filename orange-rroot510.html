The remaining Buchmanites spent the duration of the war touring the
country with their morality plays <i>You Can Defend America</i>,
<i>The Good Road</i>, and <i>The Forgotten Factor</i>.
They went through a sequence of events that resembled the end of the movie
<i>This Is Spinal Tap</i>. Moral Re-Armament went from playing giant venues
like New York's Madison Square Garden and Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl, in front
of crowds of 12,000 to 30,000 people, down to smaller and smaller halls,
and then to obscure Army bases, and finally to places like Smith Valley, Nevada,
where they played to an &quot;overflow crowd&quot; of hundreds of people
in the local high school auditorium.
<p>
Their lifestyle was also a giant step down from
glittering palaces like the Waldorf Astoria and the Mayfair Hotel.
For a while, they were homeless, and wandered from state
to state in a caravan of cars, staying at local campgrounds or in the houses
of whoever would put them up, getting money by putting on their plays and collecting
donations and selling books.
<p>
First, one  sympathetic individual gave Frank Buchman and MRA the use
of a campground in rural Maine, called &quot;Tallwood&quot;.
From there, Buchman launched his &quot;Maine School for Home Defense&quot;,
as if Buchman actually knew anything about home defense.
<p>
A few years later, another sympathizer gave them the use of part of a
campground at Lake Tahoe in California, and they wintered there for a
while. During the summer months, they were on the road, working as a
traveling show.

The Buchmanites actually grandiosely bragged that <i>You Can Defend America</i>
was &quot;Called Best Morale Epic Since 1776&quot;,

<u>
VICTORY REVUE TO BE GIVEN THIS AFTERNOON<br>
&quot;You Can Defend America&quot; Called Best Morale Epic Since 1776<br>
</u>
</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;You Can Defend America,&quot; the victory revue with a cast of more than 80 persons,
will be presented at 3 o'clock this afternoon at the Erlanger Theater under the auspices of
the Citizens Defense Committee of Georgia, the Fulton county Defense Council and the
Atlanta Defense Council.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Presented more than 120 times in 20 states under the sponsorship of governors and
defense councils, the fast moving dramatic and musical revue is presented by a cast which
is donating its time and services without charge, merely asking a community for living
expenses. Atlanta hotels and restaurants are furnishing the cast with rooms and meals so
there are no other expenses attached to the Atlanta showing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The production this afternoon will be free, and no collection with be taken up.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The fast moving musical and dramatic revue shows in 11 colorful scenes how every citizen
can help win the war, secure the peace and build a new world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Since it was first produced more than a year ago on the west coast, &quot;You Can Defend America&quot;,
has been described in newspapers as &quot;the greatest morale builder since the Declaration of
Independence.&quot;<br>

You may wonder why we chose the southern states for these four months with our full cast
of eighty rather than scatter to hot points across the nation, with smaller
numbers taking in a wider circumference. Von Clausewitz has something to say on
that: &quot;All forces which can possibly be brought to bear should be at the point
where decisive blows are to be struck, even at the risk of weakness at other points.&quot;<br>
<font color="#af0000">
[<i>Or maybe it was just that the southern states were a lot warmer in February...</i>]<br>
</font>
Then you may say, why didn't you spend all the time in Washington so the leaders
could get your philosophy of Sound Homes &#8212; Teamwork in Industry &#8212; A United Nation.
This time I'll quote Napoleon: &quot;Never attack in front a position that can be taken
by turning.&quot; All that has happened in the states has been sent to the Senators and
other national leaders in Washington at once, so they can have not only had the
philosophy but also through the convictions of their own voters.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Constantly I get the thought to build up photos of the Revue bit by bit. What it
would have meant to us today if we had drawings made at the time, on the spot, of
St. Francis and his troubadours as they worked. Now there are the photos to be made
of the man who has trained more fighters for this task than any other in the world.
Pictures are constantly needed for Washington too, showing better than letters can,
how the masses love this God-given philosophy. The cast is yet another market for
photographs of the Revue and of the various people who are thrilled by it.<br>

<i>That was quite a rationalization for the young, healthy, able-bodied
British citizen Arthur Strong spending the war years of
1939 to 1946 in the USA, safe from the war and the British draft.</i>
<p>
And Frank Buchman was equal to St. Francis? Really now.
<p>
Again, we see how egotism influences cult membership. Arthur Strong could tell
himself that his life was meaningful and really special
because he had associated with a modern-day St. Francis (rather than that he was
just a draft-dodger who abandoned his country in her most desperate hour).
<p>
Also notice how Arthur Strong claimed that they had a &quot;philosophy&quot; of 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Sound Homes &#8212; Teamwork in Industry &#8212; A United Nation&quot;
</font>
that they had to promote.<br>
As if such desires were not already commonplace.<br>
As if the Senators and Congressmen in Washington were too stupid to be
able to think of such ideas themselves, and had to be told about such
things by the Buchmanites.

And
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Sound Homes &#8212; Teamwork in Industry &#8212; A United Nation&quot;</i>

is not a &quot;philosophy&quot;. It is, as Tom Driberg said, an incantation.

Frank Buchman reduced his personal physician and true believer,

to selling copies of the booklet &quot;You Can Defend America&quot; at shows.<br>
(Photo taken in Atlanta, Georgia, sometime between April 12 and 20, 1942, probably by Arthur Strong).<br>
Also selling books were Edith Shillington (Ramsay) and Edward

<i>
So Dr. Paul Campbell was reduced to selling books at shows, just like any
other Moonie or Hari Krishna cult member?
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Why wasn't Dr. Paul Campbell serving in the Army, practicing medicine
and saving the lives of wounded soldiers?
<li>
Why was he wasting his time and talents selling books for a religious cult?
<li>
How did he avoid the draft? Did Senators Truman and Capper and Congressman
Wadsworth pull strings for him too?
<li>
Why didn't Frank Buchman patriotically tell Dr. Campbell to go join the Army and give
some of that <i>Absolute Love</i> and <i>Absolute Unselfishness</i> to the wounded
soldiers?
</ul>
</i>
<p>
It seems that after Frank Buchman got his claws into Dr. Paul Campbell,
Campbell never practiced medicine again.
Campbell wasted the rest of his life promoting Frank's cult, doing things
like collaborating with Peter Howard on
<a href="orange-rroot990.html#Paul_Campbell_book">a crazy book of hateful Buchmanite diatribes</a>.

The traveling revue got this letter from a faithful MRA member who
remained behind at the Tallwood MRA camp in Maine:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<u>George Wood, writing from Maine where, with five others, he is following up
the interest created by the Revue, January 1942</u>:<br>
We aim to translate the interest into a fighting practical program for Total Victory.
We want to raise leaders all through the State who will be a Morale Building Council,
&#8212; who can build morale, each in their own community, which is panic proof, smear
proof and fear proof with a conquering unbeatable spirit. It is particularly
necessary in this State with agriculture, shipbuilding and with the civilian
defense work. They are a swell race of rugged men.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There are still millions of innocent hopefuls here who believe fervently that
you can have &quot;morale&quot; without worrying about moral standards. We must build some
thing utterly new and strong and clean that can out-match and out-march the isms
in every sphere. We must be superior in willingness to sacrifice, in planning,
strategy, in productive power and in unity of action. Self-interest and self-indulgent
living are out for good. America will win and be a great world benefactor.<br>
