BLOG NOTE: 2012.05.19:
<p>
Today is the start of day 33, so now I stop turning the egg. The articles that I have read
say that now the gosling will be orienting itself for hatching, and turning it now will just confuse it.
So I impatiently let it sit. And I sort of fret and itch and wait.
<p>
I have been carefully turning the egg several times a day for the past month. The idea is that the little
embryo floats, and we don't want it to stick to one wall of the egg shell, so the mother goose (or me) turns
the egg over often, so that the embryo floats towards one wall, and then towards another. But now, it
isn't an embryo, it's a full-sized baby gosling in there, pretty much filling up the egg shell,
and it isn't floating any more.

<p>
The egg is still hotter than its surroundings. The temperature inside the incubator
is 99 degrees Fahrenheit at this minute, and the egg is 102.2 degrees. That baby is generating some heat.

<p>
I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Have a good weekend.

<p><br>
Later: When I saw the temperature of the egg going over 103 degrees, I started to get worried.
So I went to the library and looked up the gosling body temperature on the Internet. I quickly got
two scientific studies that said that goslings keep their bodies at 40.6 degrees Celsius. Another Internet
tool translated that to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Yikes! That is hot. No wonder those little guys feel so warm
when you pick them up. Previously, I thought their body temperature was only 102 or so, which is still lots
warmer than us.  Nope, they like it really hot.
<p>
I came home, and found that the temperature in the incubator had crept up to 100.8 degrees, which is still
within the acceptable range. And the egg was at 104.7 degrees. Previously, I would have freaked out and
worried that the egg would die from overheating, and immediately cooled it down a little.
Now I saw that the baby gosling was establishing its body temperature
quite accurately. If the external surface of the egg is 104.7, then inside of the egg it could easily be
105.0 degrees. Exactly right.  So I just let it be. I guess that little thing is enjoying the warmth.

<p><br>
And later: The sun shone down on the incubator and warmed it up a little more, so that the temperature
inside went up
to 101.3 degrees, but the egg stayed at exactly 104.7 degrees. It didn't go up even a hair. The little gosling
really has established its preferred temperature, and it is quite stable.
<p>
By the way, the incubator temperature can go up as high as 102.5 degrees.
One web page that I was reading talked about raising
the incubator temperature that high for about the last week of incubation. So 101.3 isn't too hot.

<p>
Dear all, if a person has lived the life of an alcoholic and found recovery
from this disease in the rooms of AA that person truly knows what being an
alcoholic is like. Please stop talking out of your bums as you know nothing
of the true alcoholic's mind.

Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You began your letter with that very important magical word &quot;IF&quot;.
IF people recover.  Everything that follows hinges on that one word.

<p>
First off, you are trying to assume that you know what it is like to be an alcoholic, and I don't.
Wrong. I've been through that nightmare too.
<p>
Next, you tried to assert that drinking too much alcohol is a &quot;disease&quot;.
It isn't. Habitual excessive consumption of alcohol is behavior
&#8212;  bad behavior, even fatally stupid behavior, but still behavior.

<p>
Then you assumed that going to some meetings with other maladjusted people
and maybe practicing an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties
would somehow stop such excessive consumption of alcohol. It doesn't.
There is zero evidence to support that belief.
<p>
And finally, yes, I do know about alcoholics' minds. Been there, done that.
<p>
Have a good day now.

BLOG NOTE: 2012.05.20:
<p>
I noticed that the temperature of the egg is not totally stable. It can vary a bit when the temperature in
the incubator swings to extremes. Still, it is maintaining its own warmth and staying about 2 to 2.9&deg; Fahrenheit
warmer than its surroundings. That is good. It will exactly maintain its own temperature later.
<p>
I was just reading about goose eggs, and found the statement that the baby bird dissolves the inside surface of
the egg shell to get calcium for its bones. As the baby grows, the eggshell gets thinner.
That is brilliant. That accomplishes two things at once:
it gets the baby strong bones, and it weakens the eggshell, making it easier for the baby to get out when it hatches.
<p>
I noticed that the eggshell of this egg is discolored. It started out a nice uniform
white, but now it is kind of gray in places, and discolored and mottled. It isn't a pretty eggshell
any more. That worried me, and I wondered if something was wrong with the baby. Nope. That is just
the baby consuming the eggshell. That's actually a good sign.

<p>
Talk about efficiency. Those little guys are unreal. I also heard again about how the baby bird pulls the remaining
yolk inside of itself. (Coincidentally, a home garden TV program was talking about chicks hatching.)
The last act that the baby bird does before leaving the eggshell is to pull the entire remaining yolk
and placenta inside of its belly, leaving the eggshell totally empty. The baby will use the remaining yolk for
food and energy for its first couple of days of its life, and it dissolves the placenta and reuses the material to build up its
body. Now I learn that the baby even consumes part of the egg shell. What a system. It is nearly 100% efficient.
Almost the entire egg gets turned into baby bird.
<p>
I've been studying biology all of my life, and it still amazes me.

You can see how the eggshell is no longer really white. More like grayish.
It looks like you can just barely see something very dark through the eggshell.
The brown streaks are mud stains. When the mother dropped the egg on the mud flat, one side of the egg
got muddy. 
<p>
Those two wires are the thermistors &#8212; the temperature sensors. You can see how the right-hand
one is wedged against the egg, so that I can read the egg temperature. The left-hand one is about half an
inch away from the egg, so that I can measure the air temperature around the egg.

the thermometers
</center>
At this moment, the egg temperature is 104.0&deg;, when the air temperature inside the incubator is 99.0&deg;,
so the egg is keeping itself 5.0&deg; warmer than its surroundings.
That is an unusually large difference. I guess the baby bird is taking control of its
own body temperature and generating its own warmth more and more.
<p>
2012.05.22: Two days later:<br>
The temperature differential is even more extreme. Right now, the air temperature
in the incubator is 97.7&deg;, and the egg is 105.6&deg;  &#8212;  way up there.
The egg is almost a full 8 degrees warmer than its surroundings. And it is
six-tenths of a degree above the normal gosling body temperature.
Ordinarily, I would cool it down, but it really seems to want to
be that hot. The incubator is almost 2 degrees below the ideal temperature (which is 99.5&deg;),
and the egg is warming itself up a lot. I'm not over-heating the egg; the egg is doing that itself.
Maybe that is how it prepares itself for hatching. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
<p>
By the way, the time for it to hatch is any hour now.
It could start in 5 minutes, or it could dawdle for a few more days.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Hetu-Ahin,
<p>
Thanks for the question. I guess that MA must be Marijuana Anonymous?
<p>
I have the same problem with N.A. as I do with A.A.: It doesn't work, and it's just a cult that
pushes the 12 Steps. The 12 Steps are not proceedures to quit drinking or doping, they are the
recruiting and indoctrination practices of Dr. Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult.
The 12 Steps will just mess with people's minds and
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">make them feel guilty, fearful, inadequate, and powerless</a>.
<p>
I went to a bunch of N.A. meetings for a while, and I still have my keytags,
including the 1-year glow-in-the-dark keytag. It was educational.
At the start of every meeting, the group secretary asks, &quot;Can we see a show of hands of people who have
a year or more clean, to show that this program works?&quot; And out of 50 or 75 people, two or three would
raise their hands. On a good night, maybe 5.
<p>
I was always waiting for the group secretary to ask, &quot;Can we see a show of
hands of people who have a year or more clean and sober, without doing the 12 Steps
or believing in Bill's Bull, to show that the 12-Step program is completely unnecessary?&quot;
That was when I wanted to raise my hand.  But they never asked that.
Notice how the group secretary's standard rap always assumes that people who are clean and sober got
that way because of &quot;the program&quot;, rather than by their own determined efforts.
That is claiming undue credit for the 12-Step program. But that's how they propagate the myth
that the 12 Steps work.

<p>
Marijuana Anonymous is a joke. Next I suppose they will have Vanilla Ice Cream Anonymous.
Or Munchies Anonymous.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

From:  	&quot;WILLIAM B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	FW: Ordford and Edwards/Vaillant<br>

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
Thank you for the reply and clearing up my query.

<p>
I joined AA in 1987. I had just puked up what remained of my stomache lining and was
bleeding out of other places too.
<p>
I was surrounded by people who drank like me and did not know one single person who
would admit to having a drink or drug problem. I was 24 years old. I know I would
never have gone to a doctor for help as I did not believe my life was worth saving.

<p>
The group I joined was stuffed full of older men who had all been in 2 prisons and 2
mental hospitals each. They all told me it is OK to stay here, these things do not
have to happen to you ~ just don't fucking drink any alcohol. And I believed them.

<p>
Since then AA in our area has grown enormously. There are lots of meetings but not
many real groups. The local treatment centre industry has grown really fast and
they send lots of newcomers but none of them ever seem to stay.

<p>
I did relapse after 13 years and found it really hard to stop again. Of course I
can now see that AA indoctrination had led me to believe that I was condemned to
drink myself to death. I did stop however and have 5 years now, but many many
members in our area relapsed and died drunk after 15, 20 and even 30 years. There
were a great many suicides also. I always wondered why.

<p>
Also the children of my friends were drinking themselves to death and killing
themselves at alarming rates. This bothered me a lot
and was very distressing. I can now see that having been mistreated and neglected by
their alcoholic parents and then more or less
forced to to go to Alateen to learn how to deny their feelings, some of these
children did not have much chance. 12 step help actually hurt them.

<p>
Your site has really explained a lot I did not understand.

<p>
On your points about the causes of addiction, I promised myself If I was blessed
with children I would never abuse them.

<p>
Partly because some of my friends in AA were brave enough to tell of the way they
abused their families as well as the abuse they suffered themslves. My wife and
I have a 10 year old son who is well balanced and happy. I was stealing the
drugs from around the house and eating them like sweats at his age. But D asks
politely for fruit and raw vegetables to snack on. Of course he has been utterly
surrounded all his life by people who love him and give him lots of hugs and
cuddles as well as doing anything posible to build up his self worth.

<p>
There's no doubt that if it were not for AA and my brave friends I would have died
and D would never have been born.

<p>
But it is crystal clear that 12 step theory has been killing people under my nose
for years without me notiicing.

<p>
Thanks for yours site.

<p>
William<br>
PS<br>
I saw on Wickipedia that Prof Vaillant's father shot himself in the front yard when
Vaillant was 10 yrs old. His son was the last person to see him alive. It seems
likely that Vaillant turned to religion to help himself cope. This may account for
his faith in 12 step theory in the light of it`s obvious failings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello William,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. That is quite a story.
<p>
Nearly last item first: I am so glad to hear
that you are not abusing your son. And you are right that child abuse has so much to do with
children turning to drugs and alcohol. I went out of my way to not abuse my son
(because my alcoholic father abused me), and now he just doesn't do any drugs, in spite of the fact
that he grew up in the hippie culture. He just decided that he didn't want to do them.
I never threatened him, or had &quot;the big talk&quot; where I told him not to take drugs. In fact,
I just asked him to wait until he was older and could handle it better, and to be extremely
careful about what he took.  He decided that drugs were not worth the bother all on his own.
<p>
His big indulgence is a bottle of high-class wine now and then. (He is actually an expert maker of
fine wines. That worries me, but so far he seems to be handling it just fine, and is very successful.)

<p>
About Prof. Vaillant: Thanks for that note. I didn't know that about Vaillant. That explains a lot.

<p>
I have to agree with your conclusions about A.A.: that having a group of people helping you probably
helped a lot, but the 12-Step program/philosophy/theory/theology is deadly.
I really hope SMART and SOS and Lifering get established in Great Britain and other foreign countries
so that people can have good support groups without the insanity.
<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

You may want to look into the Sinclair method of dealing with
alcoholism.  I too was persuaded by an expensive rehab (who
incidentaly take you up to step 4 and charge an extortionate amount of
money for doing so) that I may have been an alcoholic.

<p>
Naltrexone works extremly well if you don't think you have the pure
willpower to stop drinking. There is a method called the Sinclair
method that has plenty of evidence that this works.

Orange,

<p>
I'm sure you've seen The Fix, the &quot;recovery&quot; website that is very pro-AA.
The chatrooms there are priceless. This one summed it up for me:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Like the recovery industry itself, TheFix seems very pro-AA. That said,
let's look at a few recent topics covered on the site: AA gave birth to
numerous cults, including Synanon. AA biggest non-secret is the 13 step,
which is so prevalent in some meetings that they border on being sex clubs.
AA's steps can also be applied to ridiculous things like not reaching your
full financial potential or eating too many donuts. AA does yet doesn't yet
does yet doesn't yet does believe alcoholism is a disease. AA has its roots
in the teaching of Frank Buchman and The Oxford Group, both which have very
questionable histories. AA's founder, the man behind this spiritual
conversion for drunks, had numerous affairs and died depressed and angry.
And those are just starters. Look, getting together and supporting one and
another is obviously a good thing, but there are some bad things, very bad
things, in AA. It's time for the recovery industry to stand up and say Bill
Wilson's work is not the gospel for recovery. If it works for you, great.
If not, welcome to the vast majority.

Orange,
<p>
I have to admit that I have been completely enthralled and *addicted* to
your collection of writings and letter correspondence since I came across
it last Thursday.  I have been a member of the AA cult for almost three
years and just began starting to ask questions.  For a long time I have
felt uncomfortable about the helplessness and guilt waged on my psyche as a
result of &quot;the steps&quot;.  I have sat in meetings with complete loons for the
last three years wondering why I keep going and am still so blatantly
unhappy in my life which has become centered largely around AA.  In fact,
last Sunday I brought up &quot;alternative means of achieving sobriety&quot; as a
topic at a meeting &#8212; I was told that the topic sounded too much like an
essay assignment in a college class.  However, after discussing this, all
the people said that AA was the only way for them; I have relied largely on
Step 1 and consider myself an Agnostic with strong Atheist leanings which
is probably another reason I feel like blowing my brains out every time I
hear someone discuss how their spiritual experience or reliance on a higher
power has lead them to a level of serenity previously unimaginable in their
drinking and drugging careers.  I don't have a real point for writing you
except to express my deepest thanks for posting all of the information.  I
am undecided if I will quit AA, and don't want to make a rash decision.  I
have worked harder to stay sober than anything else in my life and am still
struggling after all this time.  I have tried Jesus, Taoism, Buddha,
rational thought, nothing other than AA has kept me sober and I hate it.  I
don't know what to do friend.  Thanks again.

Have you consider starting a campaign to have citizens from
every state of the United State go to their local ACLU
and complain that most &quot;treatment&quot; programs are using
public funds (mainly made out of Federal Funds) to promote
religious indoctrination?, rather than treatment that is based
on science. While all other medical modalities are based
on vast amount of scientific research. Substance Use Disorder
Treatment programs are allowed to malpractice providing
treatment which is not supported by quantitative empirical
scientific research.

Nevermind that they are violating their own 6th 8th and 11th
tradition.  One day we will discover that we are in the
Dark Ages of alcoholism treatment.

Hello Carlos,
<p>
Thank you for a great idea. I know that the ACLU has sometimes been involved in the struggle against
state-enforced religion  &#8212;  that is, sentencing people to A.A. meetings  &#8212;  but they could do a lot more.
<p>
Personally, I've been talking to a local candidate for the state legislature about that. It's easy to
argue that the state can save a lot of money by not paying for quackery that does not work.

I'll have to think about how to get the ACLU involved nation-wide.

What just flashed into my mind was a scene from the WWII mini-series <i>War And Remembrance</i>,
where the Jewish heroine and her uncle in Italy were reading brochures for Terisienstadt, which was
represented as an idyllic wonderful city for Jews, and asking themselves, &quot;Why don't we go there? It sounds really good.&quot;
(Terisienstadt the show-piece city was actually a gateway to Auschwitz.)

<p>
Yes, better ask those questions. I would also ask, &quot;What is the basic underlying philosophy? What are the
core assumptions? Core beliefs? Who created the original psychology or therapy? And what kind of a success
rate did he get? And how do they define 'success'?&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Mr Orange:
<p>
 The completion of my book on why wealthy individuals are pouring money
into the Christian Right is nearing completion.  I will see you get a copy.  Below
is a small section on AA which I assume you are interested in.  Thanks for info
although.  I did not know that back ground but was able on my own to figure
something was fowl about the program.

<p>

Before leaving Bachman, it needs mentioned when it comes to including
religion in government, Bachman flew in under the radar to become the most
unchallenged promotion of religion in government, Alcoholics Anonymous.
Preying on veterans and citizens with drinking or drug problems, the
Veteran's Administration and state hospitals across the nation indoctrinate
hundreds of citizens with this spinoff of Buchmanism each year. The two
people most credited as being the creators of Alcoholic Anonymous are Dr
Robert Smith (Dr Bob) and Bill Wilson.  Both Bob and Bill were long time
members of Bachman's Oxford Group, long enough in fact that they took a
carbon copy of Buchman's religious brainwashing methodology and wrote it
into AA's famous twelve steps.

<p>
Frank Buchman's brand of evangelism emphasized both public and private
confession of sin which when incorporated into AA became what is known as
open and closed meetings.  Open meetings designed to recruit new members
features a speaker and is open to the public.  The speaker usually blends
humor, confessions of sin and guilt with his life story in the hope that
someone in audience will relate to the speaker's story and decide &quot;Hey &#8212;
that speaker sounds like me&quot; and therefore they too require being saved
which the speaker gets around to normally in the end.  This is a fairly
successful method of getting people to accept something they may or not be
(an alcoholic) or have (an illness or mental problem).  For example
medical school students studying the symptoms of different diseases have
been known to suddenly decide that they or someone they know are suffering
from the disease they are studying.  This condition has become known as
&quot;hypochondriasis of medical students&quot;
<font size="-1"><sup>094</sup></font>
  
 As they sit and listen to the
symptoms, you might feel like this, a pain here &#8212; a pain there, or
experience this or that, the listener begins to think &quot;Gee  &#8212; That sounds
a lot like me.  I must therefore be or have X (being whatever the speaker
is quoting the conditions or symptoms of).

<p>
The closed meetings are conducted in the attendance of only members which
involves featuring confessions of all the wrongs they did while drinking.

<p>
Step 4 &#8212; Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of     ourselves

<p>
Step 5 &#8212; Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human 
being the exact nature of our wrongs
<font size="-1"><sup>095</sup></font>

<p>
These closed meeting normally begin with the Serenity Prayer (God grant us) and a
reading from AA's Daily Reflections often seasoned with a high dose of religion.
The meetings I have been to always end with The Lord's Prayer (Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven).  When I asked how ending a meeting with the Lord's
Prayer with a heaven and everything could not be seen as promoting a religion, I
normally either get a dumb look, pity, a prayer, or rejected.

<p>
Divine guidance was another request from members of the Oxford Groups and
sought after by AA's membership.

<p>
Step 11 &#8212; Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our 
conscious contact with God as we understood God, praying only for knowledge of God's
will for us and the power to carry that out
<font size="-1"><sup>096</sup></font>

<p>
Once achieved, which is not hard to convince people of, a complete surrender of
one's will to an individual's own god is beseeched.  Buchman's idea of god could
consist of any idea of god as long as that god fell into the paradigm known as
Christianity.  Buchman did not subscribe to any sole Christian affiliation.  It's
like Bachman plucked Jesus out of the churches and let the churches to their
infighting over which had the most perfect stained glass.  AA calls Bachman's form
of Jesus a Higher Power although they deny that a higher power that answers prayer,
watches out over you, gives you strength, and guilds you has anything to do with
religion.

<p>
Step 2 &#8212; Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity

<p>
Step 3 &#8212; Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood God
<font size="-1"><sup>097</sup></font>

<p>
It does however.   A common clique in AA is &quot;Let go and let god&quot; which taken from
the perspective of seeing god as the ruling elite takes on a strong social directive
of accepting of the status quo.  And it is that acceptance of the status quo that is
religion in a nutshell.

<p>
And finally Bachman's followers were to make amends to those their sinful
behavior may have harmed

<p>
Step 8 &#8212; Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became 
willing to make amends to them all

<p>
Step 9 &#8212; Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, 
except when to do so would injure them or others

<p>
Step 10 &#8212; Continued to take personal inventory and when we were 
wrong promptly admitted it
<font size="-1"><sup>098</sup></font>

and to carry their message to those still absorbed with sin.
<font size="-1"><sup>099</sup></font>

<p>
Step 12 &#8212; Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to
carry this message to other addicts, and to practice these principles in all our
affairs
<font size="-1"><sup>100</sup></font>

<p>
Does AA work?  Being a religion, it works as well as any other religion or
prayer for the same reason.  It works because it takes unto itself all its
perceived successes while placing the blame for its failures on some
external factor, usually the individual who continued drinking.  If the
person quits, AA is given the credit.  If the person does not, obviously
since AA works, the person did not apply the program correctly, refused to
turn his life over to a higher power, or wasn't being honest.

BTW who is Paul Diener?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Interesting, very interesting. I like it.
<p>

Paul Diener was a rather acidic fellow who used to post on the Kent State
U. forum called &quot;addict-L&quot;, which is a mailing list forum, and it still
exists.
But I don't think Paul Diener does.
<p>
He had a Ph.D. in history, and was very well informed. I got a lot of
leads and pointers from him. He was talking about us collaborating on a
book.
<p>
And then I believe he died. He just went silent, and they cancelled his
email account, and nobody could contact him. And that was years ago.
Then I heard that he had been in poor health. So apparently he was dumping
his screeds to the Addict-L mailing list as fast as he could before he died.


<p>
Watch out for the misspellings of Buchman. I see several instances of &quot;Bachman&quot; there. Fortunately,
modern text editors have a global search-and-replace function.

<p>
Good luck with your book, and have a good day now.
