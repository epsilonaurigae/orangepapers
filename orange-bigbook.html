<font size="+3"><b>Birth of BigBook</b></font><br>
</center>
<p>

The story of the creation of the bible of Alcoholics Anonymous,
which is properly named &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;, popularly
called The <i>Big Book</i>, is a sad tale of lies and cheating,
theft and dishonesty, all done by Bill Wilson, and even the death
of an early A.A. member, Henry Parkhurst, who couldn't stand Bill
Wilson's scheming and chicanery.
<p>
First off, Bill Wilson was only one of many authors of the
</b>Big Book</b>.
Bill was the principal author of the non-biographical opening
chapters, the much-ballyhooed &quot;first 164 pages.&quot; But
Bill had lots of free help. There were at least 32 authors.
Just for starters,
<a href="hank38.pdf" target="_blank">Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst wrote the
detailed outline for the whole book</a>, and then he wrote the
chapters <i>&quot;To Employers&quot;</i> and <i>The Unbeliever</i>.
And it's hard to say exactly what-all else Hank
wrote, because Bill Wilson had a bad habit of lying and minimizing
what Hank wrote, because Bill stole all of it.
Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocImgWindow">
claimed sole ownership</a> of
the <i>Big Book</i> when he filed for the copyright, in violation of
his promises to the other A.A. members who
wrote all of the autobiographical chapters, and who were led to
believe that the group would jointly own the book.

(Thanks to www.aaPublicControversy.com and www.aabbsg.de for the
following information. Please note that the author of the following table
wishes to give Bill Wilson much less credit for the opening chapters
than I would. He
says that Joe Worth wrote &quot;Bill's Story&quot; and &quot;To Wives, and that
chapters 2 through 9 and 11 were the product of
&quot;teamwork.&quot; I feel that Bill Wilson really
is to blame for a lot of the insanity that is in the first 164 pages.)

The original ONE HUNDRED MEN CORPORATION as publishers of the
book (it is my understanding that a facsimile of
<a href="orange-prospectus.html">the prospectus
by this corporation</a> will also be entered into evidence) which
became known as ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS sold stock shares with a
par value of $25.00 each, It is also my understanding that this
corporation was never legally incorporated in the State of New
York or anywhere else and thus could not have legally sold
shares except by fraudulent means.
<p>
To the best of my recollection, Bill Wilson used the monies from 
these shares as well as other donations to the ONE HUNDRED MEN 
CORPORATION in order to form his own corporation, WORKS PUBLISHING 
COMPANY. Bill then registered the book with the United States 
Copyright Office in the Spring of 1939 under his own name as sole 
author and trading as WORKS PUBLISHING COMPANY without the 
knowledge and/or consent of my father or any of the other members 
from Ohio. A majority of members of this Spiritual Fellowship 
resided in Akron and Cleveland, Ohio and the New York contingent 
was comprised of approximately 20 out of the 100 reported members at 
that time.
<p>

<a name="Parkhurst_cheated"> </a>
Mr. Henry G. (Hank) Parkhurst, another early member of the NY group 
from New Jersey, wrote the outline for the book and at least one 
complete chapter (TO EMPLOYERS). An AA historian who is writing Hank 
P.'s biography has reported that Bill Wilson's refusal to recognize 
him (Hank) as the author of at least that chapter was one of the 
precipitating factors in Hank's eventual split with AA. It is my 
understanding that Bill Wilson took sole 
ownership of the book as copyright holder despite his not being the 
author and thus unlawfully copyrighted the book under his own name 
on April 10, 1939. The true authors of this book were the members 
of the Fellowship. The personal stories were written by individual 
members and edited by Jim Scott (an Akron, Ohio member). Bill 
Wilson also did not write the first eleven- (11) chapters. He only 
wrote a lengthy life story of his own, typed by Ruth Hock. He 
included some resentments against Christianity and a report about 
what Ebby Thacher told him. This piece was written so poorly, that 
it could only be used for the book after Joe Worth, a member of the 
NY group and successful professional founder and editor of &quot;NY 
Magazine&quot;, had rewritten it entirely.
<p>

I know Bill Wilson was no way the author of Alcoholics Anonymous,
but a promoter. He himself admitted to his being more of an umpire
than ever an author of the book. (Page s10 in the AAWS Service Manual
has Bill Wilson stating that &quot;I became much more of an umpire than
I was ever an author.&quot;) In <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>
Bill Wilson
is quoted, &quot;Bob was far ahead of me in that sort of activity. I was
always rushing around talking and organizing and 'teaching kindergarten.'
I never grew up myself' and I can confirm that. Rather than argue
with, and possibly embarrass Bill Wilson, my father chose not to
expose Bill for his devious ways for the good of the Fellowship.
<p>
<a name="ACE_cheated"> </a>
One of the authors of a personal story that appeared in the original
manuscript (ACE FULL...SEVEN ELEVEN) from Akron asked that his story
be removed from the book prior to publication after finding out about
Bill's personal financial aspirations from the sale of the book.
It was revealed that Bill and Ruth Hock already publicly distributed
the multilith manuscript and sold it for $3.50. A part of the
approximately 400 copies were not sold. Neither my father's copy nor
any of the other copies I have ever seen or heard of had been stamped
&quot;Loan Copy,&quot; or bore any such similar statement. The
relating report in <i>AA Comes of Age</i> (page 165) is fraudulent
and dead wrong. Many of the Ohio members were also upset but were
told by my father that for the good of the Fellowship not to further
hinder publication of the book.

<br>
[...]
<br>
<a name="copyright_invalid2"> </a>
I believe that since the copyright on the First and Second Edition 
of the book, ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS was allowed to lapse, either on 
purpose or by oversight, so should any of Bill Wilson's written 
contributions to AA be placed in the public domain as have my 
father's writing's. Authorship of the AA book was a group effort and 
as such, authorship cannot be attributed to any one person. 
I attest that the above statement is true to the best of my 
recollection and do hereby affix my signature below.

The text that Sue Smith Windows refers to on page 165 of
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Four hundred mimeograph copies of the book were made and sent
to everyone we could think of who might be concerned with the
problem of alcoholism. Each mimeograph was stamped &quot;Loan
Copy&quot; in order to protect our coming copyright.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 165.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Doctor Bob's daughter says that Bill Wilson lied. There was no such stamp on the copies.
(The A.A. historian
<a href="orange-not_good.html#MitchellK_list">Mitchell K.</a>
reported that he had seen about 20 of the multilith
edition copies, and none of them had such a stamp on them.)

<p>
You see, if the first printing isn't copyrighted, and that first
multilith printing wasn't, then the copyright is lost forever and
the book falls into the public domain immediately. Wilson learned that grim fact too late &#8212;
he had already sold a bunch of multilith (like mimeograph) copies of
the book for $3.50 each &#8212;
so he fabricated the story that the multilith copies were just
preliminary pre-press loaner review copies, and not a real printing.
But when someone sells copies of a book, it's a real printing, no matter
how small or primitive the printing is.
<p>
And, as one wit said,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Losing a copyright is like losing your virginity.
Once you lose it, it's gone, and you can't get it back.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<a name="copyright_expired">
When Sue Smith Windows declared that the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i>
and Bill's other writings should be allowed to lapse, she probably did not
realize that her wish had already been granted.
There actually was no valid copyright on the <i>Big Book</i>, not ever.
<p>
And even if there had been one, it would have had to have been renewed
after 28 years. But it was not. As unbelievable as it may seem, the staff at the
Alcoholics Anonymous headquarters in New York City was so incompetent that they
neglected to renew the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i>. They let the copyright expire.

<p>
So the copyright of the first edition (1939) would have lapsed in 1967, and the
copyright of the second edition (1955) would have lapsed in 1983 &#8212; if they had
ever been valid, which they weren't. The second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>
contains both The Twelve Steps and The Twelve Traditions, so both have unquestionably
been in the public domain since at least 1983.

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An unknown author has sleuthed out some more very revealing
truths about Bill Wilson's handling of the <i>Big Book</i> finances
from Bill Wilson's later book, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">Check it out.</a> That web page also features
a breakdown of the <i>Big Book</i> project's very questionable finances
and obvious fraud.

<p>
<a name="WorksPub1"> </a>
A newly-organized company, called 
<b>Works Publishing Inc.</b> was founded June 20th, 1940. 
Herbert Taylor was the President and Horace Crystal was the
Vice-President. 
Bill Wilson was not involved, and not allowed to hold any
office in the new company, because he had previously taken
and spent thousands of dollars of stock subscriber cash
plus Charles B. Towns' donations and other moneys, as well as
dishonestly filing for the copyright in his own name.<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Note that this was a new <i>corporation</i>. Bill Wilson had
used the name &quot;Works Publishing&quot; on the copyright form,
but there was no such company in existence other than
<i>&quot;Wm. G. Wilson, trading as Works Publishing Co.&quot;</i>
until this new company was incorporated in June, 1940.
Henry Parkhurst and Bill Wilson had previously started up
and
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#sub">
sold shares in</a> the
&quot;One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;, remember, and that is the
company that was supposed to write and publish the book.
But throughout his <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> book,
Bill Wilson talked constantly about <i>Works Publishing</i>, and
says that it was the company that did it all.
In that book, Wilson did not even admit
that the &quot;One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; ever existed.
He says that they went around selling stock in Works Publishing
to raise the money to support writing the <i>Big Book</i>.
That is false.
William Wilson, Henry Parkhurst and William J. Ruddel were selling
stock in the &quot;One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;.
See the
<a href="orange-Prosp14.gif" target="imgwin2">subscription form</a>.
</font>
<p>
Here is the financial statement that they prepared, that shows the
receipts and disbursements of the early book project. Also note the name
switch.
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#corp_name">
Stock had been sold in</a>, and moneys collected for,<br>
<center>
<font size="+1" color="#9F0000">
--&gt; &quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;. &lt;--
</font>
</center>
But the financial statement purported to explain
the financial operations of a company called &quot;Works Publishing
Co.&quot;.
What happened to the <b>One Hundred Men Corporation</b>, and its
shares, and its money?
It seems to have been quietly forgotten.
<p>
Actually, what happened is the other members of Alcoholics Anonymous
covered up for Bill Wilson's crimes, to avoid a scandal. They started
telling a story about how they had simply decided to change the name
of the company from &quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; to
&quot;Works Publishing&quot;.
That was after Bill had copyrighted the <i>Big Book</i> in the name of Works Publishing,
claiming that <i>he was</i> the publishing company &#8212; that it was a sole proprietorship,
&quot;Wm G. Wilson, dba Works Publishing&quot;.

<p>

Bill Wilson invested $100 in the company, and then was paid $1558 to write
the first 11 chapters of
the <i>Big Book</i>. He was
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#budget" target="DocImgWindow">
supposed to be paid $1000 for the work</a>, but he
ended up getting paid $1558. That was very generous:
<ul>
<li>
$1558 in Year 1939 dollars
equals $18,407.46 in Year 2000 dollars. Not too bad, for a few months spent
writing or co-writing nine or ten chapters (9 or 10 because Henry
Parkhurst wrote the <i>&quot;To Employers&quot;</i> chapter, and
Joe Worth wrote or rewrote Bill's own story).
<li>
That was <i>really</i> not too bad, considering that Bill
Wilson was a failed &quot;stock analyst&quot;, not a professional writer,
and not an expert on recovery.<br>
<li>
And that was <i>really, really</i> not too bad, considering that Doctor Bob's
daughter, Sue Smith Windows, says that other people did most of the
writing, and that Bill Wilson was such a bad writer that everything
he wrote had to be rewritten.
<li>
Bill wasn't even a knowledgeable alcoholism recovery counselor, either.
By December 1938, Bill's sole experience
with recovery was completing 4 years of sobriety for himself,
helping to sober up Doctor Bob, and then
getting about 20 members of his New York group to stay sober for
shorter periods of time, while
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons">surreptitiously indoctrinating them all</a>
with the religion of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">

and then watching the A.A. members relapse repeatedly...

But that wasn't enough money for Bill, not nearly enough. He then
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">took and spent much of the money</a>
that had been raised to print the book.
<a href="orange-Henrietta_Seiberling.html">Henrietta Seiberling
was rather upset about it.</a>

Bill Wilson was so eager to make money off of the book that he printed up
a premature multilith edition <i>that contained no copyright notice</i>
and sold copies for $3.50 each.
That immediately, permanently, voided any possible copyright on the book.
(Once a copyright is lost, it can never be regained. If something is first published
without a copyright notice, or if the first printing is not properly copyrighted,
then the work immediately falls into the public domain, and remains there forevermore.)

<p>
When Wilson learned of the seriousness of his error, he fraudulently
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocImgWindow">filed
for the copyright in his own name</a>, claiming that he was the sole author of the book,
and doing business as the publishing company &quot;Works Publishing&quot; (which did
not exist).
Note that the resulting copyright was invalid, and has always been invalid,
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">is still invalid</a>.<br>
(That is why
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222309/http://www.recovery.org/aa/download/BB-plus.html">you can
legally download copies</a>
of the first edition <i>Big Book</i>
from the Internet for free.)

<p>
<a name="royalties"> </a>
Then Bill Wilson traded the copyright that he had stolen
for a lifetime income in what looks suspiciously like a blackmail deal.
The &quot;Alcoholic Foundation&quot; absolutely had to have the copyright to
be able to continue publishing the <i>Big Book</i>,
and Bill Wilson had it, so Bill dictated terms that gave him an income
for the rest of his life. (The other alcoholics did not realize that the
copyright was invalid.)
<p>
First, the deal was that Bill got $100 per month
(if available from book sales),
for the use of the book's copyright, in addition to
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#wilson_income" target="DocImgWindow">
a $120 per month stipend</a> that came from outside donations,
like from John D. Rockefeller Jr.. (Yes,
those <i><b>outside donations</b></i> that are forbidden by the Seventh
Tradition.)
<p>
<a name="WorksPub2"> </a>
Later, the agreement was changed (by Bill) to Bill receiving royalties for life
(and beyond) on the sales of the book.
By 1944, the royalties had climbed to $200 per month, and kept going up.
Bill never worked again. Bill died rich.
(Lois Wilson's heirs still collect over $1 million per year in royalties
from this deal and Bill's other writings.)
None of the other co-authors, except Doctor Bob, got a penny from
the <i>Big Book</i>. Bill took it all.

<p>
Note that the deal is not explicitly spelled out in this document; it
simply says that Bill Wilson got $1 and &quot;other good and lawful
consideration.&quot; And he got a whole lot of &quot;other good and lawful
consideration&quot;; in the end, millions of dollars.

In that document where Bill assigns all rights in the <i>Big Book</i> to
Works Publishing, Inc.,
Bill stated:
<p>
<blockquote>

City, N. Y. ... do sell, assign and transfer over unto WORKS PUBLISHING, INC. ...

of which I am author and proprietor ...

</blockquote>
<p>
Another person who cast a critical eye on the <i>Big Book</i> deal asked
whether all of the authors of the stories in the <i>Big Book</i> signed
over the rights to their stories to Bill Wilson. If not, then Bill Wilson
could not sign over all of the rights to the <i>Big Book</i> to Works Publishing, Inc.
He could not sell what he did not own.
<p>
There is no record of any such signing party. In fact, the authors
of the stories were angry
that Bill had stolen the copyright after he promised them that the book would
be owned by the group, so they didn't sign anything over to Bill.

Bill Wilson's psychiatrist, Dr. Harry Tiebout, was irritated with
Wilson's distortion of the history of A.A. and the <i>Big Book</i>.
Ernest Kurtz reported in his book,
<i>Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A report on this first meeting of the General Service Conference
of Alcoholics Anonymous in the June 1951 <i>A.A. Grapevine</i>
again roused the ire of Dr. Harry Tiebout. The psychiatrist wrote
Wilson an accusing letter, &quot;pointing out the dangers of
historical distortion, egotism, and damaging ingratitude.&quot;
His special objection was that Bill had unjustly ignored the role
of A.A.'s non-alcoholic friends in saving Works Publishing, Inc.,
in its troubled early days. This particularly irked the doctor
because he himself had been an open-pursed purchaser of the apparently
worthless stock.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In rejoinder, Wilson acknowledged that some clarity had indeed been
lacking in his brief description of that episode of history, but Bill
went on to deny vigorously an intentional &quot;historical
distortion&quot; in the interests of making Alcoholics Anonymous
appear &quot;self-sufficient&quot; and so more maturely independent
than had actually been the case in its early days. He pointed out,
in obvious high dudgeon, that &quot;in the past year we've
tremendously spread information concerning the vital roles
played by Silkworth, Tiebout, Dowling, Fosdick, Rockefeller,
Richardson, Alexander and a dozen others.&quot;<br>

Note that, when the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i> was
published in 1955, Bill Wilson carried out a Stalin-like purge of
almost all of the original A.A. <i>Big Book</i> authors, those
other old-timers
who had almost as much seniority as Bill Wilson, and who could
complain that Wilson had broken his promise to them.
(Stalin got rid of all of the other old-timers who could possibly be
rivals and threaten his supremacy, and so did Bill.)
Bill Wilson had promised them that they would all own the book in
common, and that the profits would go to the Alcoholic Foundation.
What really happened was that Bill Wilson ended up owning the copyright,
and Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob got all of the royalties from the book,
and nobody else got anything.
Wilson removed the other old-timers' stories and replaced them with new
stories by other authors who had not been promised anything.
<p>
There was also the problem of relapsers.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses">Fully fifty percent of the
<i>Big Book</i> authors had failed to maintain sobriety</a>. Bill Wilson
never publicized that fact; he just silently replaced their stories with new
stories from some other A.A. enthusiasts who also grandly declared that A.A. had
miraculously saved them from a life of drunkenness.
<p>
Henry Parkhurst's chapter in the front of the book, <i>To Employers</i>,
was left in, but his autobiographical story, <i>The Unbeliever</i>,
was discarded. Hank was not in a position to complain, because he
was dead. (He died drunk.)
Dr. Bob's autobiographical chapter was left in, but he had been
sharing in the money, so he wouldn't complain.
Besides, he was a co-founder, and his writings were considered sacred.
Besides, he was also dead, so he couldn't complain either.
Three other people were left in, but they were vastly outnumbered,
if not dead, so they couldn't make much of a fuss, even if they
wished to.
One of them was Fitz M., whose story <i>Our Southern Friend</i>
had to be left in because his story was also described at the end
of the <i>We Agnostics</i> chapter &#8212; he was the one who allegedly
heard God say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Who are you to say there is no God?&quot;</font>
Besides which, Fitz was also a true believer, and he wouldn't complain.
Clarence Snyder, the founder of A.A. in Cleveland was retained (only to be
dumped out of the 4th edition).
But almost everybody else was purged.

<p>
The new <i>Big Book</i> authors got no promises about how
&quot;We will all share the ownership of the book.&quot;
The new generation of authors clearly understood that Bill Wilson
was the King who would be supported in comfort for the rest of his life,
while they would get nothing for their stories.

For narcissists, control serves the same function as power &#8212; it protects
them from possible humiliation. First, they control themselves by denying those
feelings which might make them vulnerable. But they also have to control
situations in which they find themselves; they have to make sure that there
is no possibility that some other person will have power over them.
Power and control are two sides of the same coin. Together, they work to protect
the individual from feeling vulnerable, from feeling powerless to prevent
a humiliation.<br>

<font size="+1"><b>Ernie Galbraith, A.A. Number Four:</b><br></font>
See the book <i>Children Of The Healer</i> for
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Galbraith">Sue Smith Windows' story</a> of
her father, the autocratic &quot;Doctor Bob&quot;,
forbidding her to see her high-school sweetheart, Ray Windows,
and using the older alcoholic womanizer Ernie Galbraith &#8212;
&quot;AA #4&quot; &#8212; to break up her romance with Ray.
Ernie ended up grabbing Susan for himself.
It was a disastrous marriage. Ernie relapsed constantly. He even wrote
the story &quot;The Seven Month Slip&quot; for the <i>Big Book</i>,
which described a seven-month-long relapse.
He also philandered a lot,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">just like Bill Wilson</a>.
Ernie Galbraith's story was quietly removed from the second edition of
the <i>Big Book</i> in 1955, but it took Sue until 1965 to get divorced
from Ernie. Then, she finally married Ray Windows after his first
wife died.

Note that the earlier editions of the A.A. book are available
for free on the Internet. It seems
that somebody was too &quot;sober&quot; to remember to renew the
copyrights (if the original copyright was even ever valid, which is
highly unlikely, because Bill Wilson stole the copyright for himself
when the book was really written by more than 30 people).<br>
