<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_testimonies">21</a>.
<i>Personal testimonies of earlier converts.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Half of every meeting is spent listening to the earlier
converts &quot;sharing&quot;
the message that A.A. and the Twelve Steps saved
their lives, and brought them infinite bliss and happiness,
and Serenity and Gratitude.
And I have never, ever, heard one person &quot;share&quot; the
message that the Twelve Step program didn't work for him or
her. The A.A. faithful do not bring the dead bodies in from
the grave yards, to hear <i>their</i> stories.
<p>
And the A.A. members act like the people in the story
<i>&quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot;</i> while delivering their testimonials.
People happily brag that the Twelve Steps have worked for them, and made them
into wonderful happy new really spiritual people who are joyously close to God.
If someone says that the Steps aren't working for him, then he is just
confessing that he isn't spiritual, and he isn't <i>working a strong program</i>,
and that God isn't favoring him.
So no one wants to admit that he is the only one for whom the Twelve Steps
are not working...
<p>

While sharing, people also like to beat up on themselves and praise
their sponsors:
<ul>
<li>
&quot;My thinking is really messed up, but my sponsor
is clear-headed and is competent to run my life for me...&quot;
<li> &quot;It took me years to learn to really do the Twelve Steps
properly. I just goofed off for my first few years in A.A...&quot;
<li> &quot;I didn't know what to do, but my sponsor had the answer.&quot;
</ul>

A.A. scores a 6.<br>
<p>
Many A.A. members are extremely absorbed in A.A.; for some,
&quot;the program&quot; is their entire life.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I decided I must
place this program above everything else, even my family, because if I
did not maintain my sobriety I would lose my family anyway.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<i>
(Note how the author falsely equated doing the Alcoholics Anonymous practices with
actually maintaining sobriety. They are two very different things, and most A.A. members do not
maintain sobriety.)
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, a common A.A. slogan is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;You must not allow <i>anything</i> to get in front of your sobriety!&quot;<br>
</font>
&#8212; Which really means,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;You must not allow <i>anything</i> to get in front of your A.A. membership!&quot;<br>
</font>


<p>
While some A.A. members are balanced and do have a life of their own,
far too many
others make the recovery program and &quot;being in recovery&quot;
their new lifestyle.
Rather than recovering from alcoholism, and getting on with their
lives, they plan to spend the rest of
their lives &quot;in recovery&quot;, and they have no goals in
life other than to be &quot;in recovery&quot; and nurse their sobriety,
and &quot;work the program.&quot;
<p>
There is an immense difference between recognizing that you cannot
ever drink alcohol again, for the rest of your life, because you
will go nonlinear and get re-addicted if you do, and spending
the rest of your life &quot;in recovery&quot;, declaring
that you cannot ever recover. The difference is that in the first
case, you do recover...
<p>

Some people are so obsessed with being in Alcoholics Anonymous
that they have to go
to a meeting every day, or they feel like their life will go
to pieces. Some people do two or three meetings a day.
For them, Alcoholics Anonymous is simply a new addiction,
and that is not at all healthy.
Bill Wilson even declared in the <i>Big Book</i> that membership
in A.A. was a new dependency, to replace dependency on alcohol.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You say, &quot;...I know I must get along without liquor,
but how can I? Have you a sufficient substitute?&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, there is a substitute, and it is
vastly more than that. It is a fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous.
There you will find release from care,
boredom and worry. Your imagination will be fired. Life will mean
something at last. The most satisfactory years of your existence lie
ahead. Thus we find the fellowship, and so will you.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>

<p>

The A.A. apologists argue that being addicted to A.A. is an
immense improvement over being addicted to alcohol. And the
N.A. enthusiasts say much the same thing, that &quot;Being addicted to
N.A. is better than a heroin addiction.&quot;
If that's the best that can be said for those programs, then that
is damning them with faint praise.
<p>
&quot;It beats shooting heroin.&quot; Yeh, right.

<a name="wife_neglected"> </a>
I've talked with ex-wives of alcoholics who stayed married to their
husbands while they were drinking, but who had to divorce them
after the guys joined Alcoholics Anonymous and became obsessed with
&quot;the program.&quot;
The women said that they had to get divorced, because they
didn't even have husbands any more; they had
<a href="orange-letters.html#Linda" target="_blank">lost their husbands</a>
to Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Even A.A. founder Bill Wilson reported the problem:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery.
A kindly act once in a while isn't enough.
You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Your wife may sometimes say she is neglected.<br>
</font>

</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After the husband joins A.A., the wife may become discontented, even
highly resentful that Alcoholics Anonymous has done the very thing that all
her years of devotion had failed to do.
Her husband may become so wrapped up in A.A. and his new friends
that he is inconsiderately away from home more than when he drank.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Thanks to A.A., he is now away from home more than when he drank...</i><br>

It's hopeless. Might as well divorce him, and try to get a man who
actually wants to be a husband instead of an obsessed cult member...

<p>
And a rehash of the <i>Big Book</i> that is targeted at youths tells this story of an
allegedly-successful recovery:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<i>Dual Purposes, Hidden Agendas, and Ulterior Motives</i>.</b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Their publicly-visible purpose is to help people
quit drinking, but their secret purpose is to promote their
proselytizing fundamentalist cult religion, to get people to <i>Seek
and Do the Will of God</i> (as they define The Will of God, of course.)

<p>
In drug and alcohol treatment programs, the counselors
(who are A.A. and N.A. members)
say that they are there to help people, but they are
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program" target="_blank">really there</a>
to push the patients into their cult religion.
They rationalize their actions by saying, &quot;Well of course we
should do that. We are helping the patients.
We are saving their lives.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank">Everybody knows</a>
that A.A. and N.A. are

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment" target="_blank">Nobody can do

The Twelve Steps are how we recovered, and it's how everybody else
will recover, too.&quot;

The same is true of

greater than you, who have not even come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in
them. Even this minimum of faith will be enough. You will find many members who have crossed
the threshold just this way. All of them will tell you that, once across, their faith
broadened and deepened.

<a name="ca_aggressive_recruiting"> </a>
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_aggressive_recruiting">24</a>.
<i>Aggressive Recruiting.</i></b></font><br>
Score A.A. at a 10.<br>
<p>
This is a tricky one.
Unlike many religious cults, A.A. <b>does
not</b> aggressively recruit on the street corners or in any
other public places, nor do they go door
to door like some annoying religions that we all know about. The
Twelfth Step requires members
to recruit new members, but that is done in a low-key manner.
<p>
<a name="coercion"> </a>
<p>
What is <b>not</b> low-key is the practice of using the legal and health
care systems to force people to go to A.A. meetings.
Alcoholics Anonymous is a coercive religion that routinely uses
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">the court system, judges, parole officers</a>, and
treatment counselors to force people to attend its church services.
<p>
(Not even Scientology or the Moonies can manage to practice <i>coercive
recruiting</i>. They can't get judges to
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">sentence people to their cults</a>,
although Scientology has certainly been trying. Scientology
has a front group called
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#Narconon" target="_blank">Narconon</a>
which supposedly uses Scientology
&quot;principles&quot; to get people off of drugs and alcohol.
They have been unsuccessfully lobbying to get
municipal contracts to treat alcoholics and drug addicts the Scientology way.
So far, A.A. and N.A. cult members keep a firm grasp on that franchise.)
<p>

The judge says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Ninety meetings or ninety days!&quot;
</font>
and A.A. is more than happy to play along.<br>
As one wag said,
<font color="blue">
&quot;A.A. is in the position of a snake who is being force-fed mice.
Not that the snake was all that unwilling.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Those treatment counselors who force people into A.A. meetings are
<b><i>usually</i></b> A.A. members, and the
judges and probation officers sometimes are. But more often, the
judges and probation officers are just
good, well-meaning people who have been led to believe that A.A. is
a wonderful moral organization
that gets people off of alcohol and drugs, and is a good
moral influence on alcoholics and drug addicts.
They believe that for several reasons:
<ul>
<li> First, it is often the
therapy program counselors who tell the
judges and probation officers that A.A. is good for getting alcoholics
to quit drinking. The counselors will even say that A.A. is the <b>only</b>
thing that works. Or they will say that &quot;A.A. is the <i>proven</i>
way.&quot;
<p>
<li> Second, the therapy program
is the city- or state-approved program
for treating alcoholics, and the therapy program usually, almost
always, uses A.A. and N.A. as part of its course of treatment.
Of course &#8212; the counselors are almost all A.A. and N.A. members.

<p>
<a name="promotion"> </a>
<li> Third, A.A. has been very successfully promoting
itself in the media for many, many
years, in violation of
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">the Eleventh Tradition</a>,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Our public relations policy is based on attraction
rather than promotion.&quot;</b><br>
</font>
<p>
A.A. members routinely place articles in magazines and journals
that are nothing but deceptive propaganda that advertises A.A. as a
working treatment program for alcoholism:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#unscientific_doctors" target="_blank"><i>Doctors in A.A.</a>; the profession's skepticism persists, but MDs
in Alcoholics Anonymous say the 12-step program could benefit all
physicians</i>, by C. Thomas Anderson.
<li> <a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank"><i>Spirituality: The key to recovery
from alcoholism</i></a>,
by Warfield, Robert D.; Goldstein, Marc B.
<li> <a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank"><i>The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</i></a>, by
Jeff Jay.
<li> <a href="orange-big_lie.html" target="_blank"><i>Are we making
the most of Alcoholics Anonymous? (The Last Word)</i></a>, by Peter Armstrong.
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a9.html#Rafalovich" target="_blank"><i>Keep coming back!
Narcotics Anonymous narrative and recovering-addict identity</i></a>, by Adam Rafalovich.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="fake_studies"> </a>
Then shills and promoters of Alcoholics Anonymous plant propagada articles in technical
and medical journals &#8212; articles that feature bad logic and invalid assumptions
and false conclusions:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">Keith Humphries' and Rudolf Moos' propaganda</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters31.html#Moos3" target="_blank">another one of Rudolf Moos' fake studies</a>
<li>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters90.html#summary" target="_blank">four fake studies</a>
</ul>


<p>
<a name="planted"> </a>
A.A. members have repeatedly planted stories of people being helped by
A.A. or N.A. in TV programs like <i>Cagney and Lacy</i>.
Recently, the TV programs <i>Hill Street Blues</i>,
<i>ER</i> and <i>The West Wing</i> have
been pushing the idea that everybody, cops, doctors, White House
staffers, and even the Vice President of the United States, use
12-step meetings to solve their drug and alcohol problems.
<p>
<a name="Borchert"> </a>
And then there was the Hallmark Hall of Fame
made-for-TV movie, <i>&quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;</i> (April 30, 1989, 9 PM, ABC TV),
which gave a very dishonest, extremely distorted, highly-sanitized version
of the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous, like showing Bill W.
attending a meeting and getting his feelings hurt because no one
recognized him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 The truth is that Bill Wilson had toured the country
on so many speaking tours, and
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">broken his anonymity</a>
so many times, and gotten
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#newspaper_picture" target="_blank">his picture</a> printed in the newspapers so many times, that it was
almost impossible for him to not be recognized at any A.A. meeting.
Besides, Bill
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#tip_reporter" target="_blank">routinely
pre-announced his visits to other groups</a>, calling ahead
to arrange for a newspaper reporter and a photographer to be present
to document the &quot;historic occasion&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Likewise, the movie shows Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob starting Alcoholics Anonymous in Akron, Ohio, in the
spring of 1935. They went supposedly went recruiting in hospitals,
 and learned how to get alcoholics to join their new sobriety club that they were just inventing as they went along.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Bill and Bob were both enthusiastic members of the pro-Nazi Oxford Group
cult religion, and they were recruiting new members for the Oxford Group in Akron.
The new recruits went straight into the Oxford Group and nowhere else.
 And both Bill Wilson and
Dr. Bob continued recruiting for the Oxford Group all through 1935 and 1936, Bill in New York, and Bob in Akron.
And Dr. Bob actually continued being a faithful member of the Oxford Group through 1938.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Meanwhile, the Oxford Group's leader,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman, went to Nuremberg, Germany, in 1934 and 1935,
and attended Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies</a>, and saluted Hitler with <i>Sieg Heil!</i>
salutes along with the rest of the Nazis, and then Buchman had lunch with Heinrich Himmler, who
was the infamous leader of the Gestapo and the S.S., who would soon run the Hallocaust that
exterminated six million Jews, and another six million priests, ministers, gays, Poles, Gypsys, and
political opponents.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then Frank Buchman attended the Berlin Olympics in 1936 as the personal guest of Heinrich Himmler, and came
back to America saying, &quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot; None of the founders of
Alcholics Anonymous, neither Bill Wilson
nor Dr. Robert Smith nor Clarence Snyder, quit the Oxford Group in protest.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But the screenplay writer William Borchert didn't choose to tell the truth
about any of that. He pretended that the Oxford Group never existed. And neither did Frank
Buchman or Adolf Hitler.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
There are more discussions of the movie &quot;My Name is Bill W.&quot;
<a href="orange-letters167.html#Hallmark2" target="_blank">here</a>

<a href="orange-letters250.html#Andrew_M" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters334.html#Dennis_M" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And don't forget the movies like <i>&quot;Twenty-eight Days&quot;</i>,
<i>&quot;Clean and Sober&quot;</i>, and
<i>&quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;</i> all of which tell us
that the 12-step routine actually works.

<p>
Also, A.A. has lately even been running television commercials, which
is also certainly a violation of
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">the Eleventh Tradition</a>, which
says that A.A. is supposed to be a program of attraction, not promotion.

<p>
<li> Fourth, A.A. benefits from the Bible Bias. That is, most Americans
have been brought up to believe that religious people are somehow more
moral than other people. No matter how we might try to avoid it, we can't
help but feel that an organization that encourages drunks and
drug addicts to pray and do the Will of God must be some kind of a good group,
<i>very religious</i>.
<p>
But, as Sportin' Life sang in Gershwin's opera <i>Porgy and Bess</i>,
&quot;<b>It Ain't Necessarily So</b>&quot;. (Again, think about Rev.
Jim Jones and his People's Temple. They yammered the words
&quot;God&quot; and &quot;Jesus&quot; right up to the time that they
all drank the cyanide Flavor-Aid&reg;... and forced it on those who did not wish to die...
and forced 267 children to drink it...)
</ul>
<p>

In addition, recruiters routinely
visit drug and alcohol detox and rehab facilities &#8212; if they
don't already own and run them &#8212; and
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">play mind games on people</a> who
are sick and detoxing, and tell them,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, you tried living your own way, and it didn't work out well
at all, did it?
It turned you into a horrible monster, and a real loser, didn't it?
So now you should start living God's Way.&quot;<br>
</font>
&#8212; And it is
always &quot;God's Way&quot; <i>as they define it</i>, of course.
<p>
This is even documented in the <i>Big Book</i>:<br>

<blockquote>

All of chapter seven of the <i>Big Book</i> is a recruiting manual that teaches A.A.
members how to go recruiting. That chapter begins with the words,
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive
work with other alcoholics. It works when other activities fail. This is our <i>twelfth suggestion</i>:
Carry this message to other alcoholics!<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have indulged in spiritual intoxication.
Like a gaunt prospector, belt drawn in over the last ounce of food,
our pick has struck gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of
frustration knew no bounds. Father feels he has struck something
better than gold. For a time he may try to hug the new treasure
to himself. He may not see at once that he has barely scratched a
limitless lode which will pay dividends only if he mines it for
the rest of his life and insists on giving away the entire product.<br>

<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, Chapter 9,
<i>The Family Afterward</i>, pages 128-129.</font>
<p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Giving away the entire product&quot; is a euphemism for
recruiting new members for A.A. &#8212;
<i>&quot;Freely giving that which was freely given to us&quot;</i>.
So that paragraph really means that you can't ever
leave the group, and must spend the rest of your life <i>&quot;working a strong
program&quot;</i> and recruiting new members.

</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="coerced_attendance"> </a>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
The worst promotion of A.A. is the coercive recruiting.
A.A. routinely encourages judges, parole officers, counselors and therapists
to force people to go to A.A. meeings to &quot;to get help.&quot;
(Often, the counselors and therapists are themselves members of A.A. or N.A..)
And then the A.A. boosters deny any responsibility, and say that they don't
force anyone to do anything.
<p>
A.A. defenders invariably deny it, but court-ordered attendance
is most assuredly the fault of A.A., and N.A..
They encourage it: the A.A. and N.A. true-believer
drug and alcohol &quot;recovery counselors&quot;
(Twelfth Step recruiters) tell the judges
and parole officers that A.A. and N.A. are the only things that work,
and that giving people &quot;treatment&quot; &#8212; based on the
Twelve Steps, of course &#8212; and
sending people to A.A. or N.A. meetings is the best thing to do with them.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;And besides, getting those drunks and dopers praying will be
good for them.&quot;</font>

<p>
A.A. and N.A. could stop it immediately, by telling the courts that
they do not want any coerced referrals, and that they will not
sign any more court slips. But they aren't about to do that, because
they would lose one third of their new recruits if they
did.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
<p>
<a name="Little_Red_Book"> </a>
<i>The Little Red Book</i> of Hazelden (yes, a clone of the Communist
<i>Little Red Book of Chairman Mao</i>)
specifically teaches A.A. recruiters to indoctrinate judges, police, doctors,
and other officials as part of the proselytizing work. It says
that faithful A.A. members can <i>&quot;carry the message&quot;</i> by:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
11. By telling the A.A. story to clergy members, doctors, judges,
educators, employers, or police officials if we know them well
enough to further the A.A. cause, or to help out a fellow member.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 128.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then that book even goes on to tell recruiters to teach the
judges, police, doctors, and other officials just
<i>what kind of people</i> A.A. wants coerced into attending
its meetings:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By educating doctors, the clergy, judges, police officials, and
industrial personnel regarding the type of people A.A. can help,
we will avoid flooding our ranks with an unwieldy preponderance
of nonalcoholics.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 137.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So much for the lie about how A.A. can't help it if the judges,
parole officers, doctors, and therapists force people to go to A.A. meetings.
<p>
And Hazelden is merely echoing Bill Wilson's instructions.
In a 1939 letter from Bill to Earl T., a founding member of the
Chicago A.A. group, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By educating doctors, hospitals, ministers along this line,
you will surely pick up some strong prospects after a bit.<br>

And what is the result of such coercive recruiting tactics?
<p>
The centerfold of the November 2002 issue of the <i>AA Grapevine</i>
summarized the results of the most recent triennial survey of the A.A. membership. It
found that the majority of the A.A. members had been &quot;introduced&quot; to
A.A. by pressure or coercion from the health care system or criminal
justice system:

<p>
<center>
<table width="44%" border="3" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td align="right"><font size="4"> 32% </font></td><td> Treatment facility </td></tr>

<tr><td align="right"><font size="4"> 7% </font></td><td> Health care provider </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"><font size="4"> 2% </font></td><td> Correctional facility </td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">
<font size="-1">
See: <i>AA Grapevine</i>, November 2002, pages 32-33.
</font>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
So 61% of the current membership was forced into A.A.
by the health care or justice systems.
That is nearly two thirds of the entire membership.
If coercive recruiting for A.A. stopped, then A.A. would really shrink.

<p>
Now we have available to us some of the results of the 2005 Triennial Survey. We see the same
pattern of coercion again:

<p>
<center><table width="50%" border="5" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman"> referred by a treatment facility </font></td><td>

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman"> by court order </font></td><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">  11% </font></td></tr>

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman"> through a counseling agency </font></td><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">  8% </font></td></tr>

<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman"> Total </font></td><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">  63% </font></td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>
Those are almost the same coercion numbers as came from
the previous triennial survey &#8212; they are just two points higher.
And this time they left off the category of &quot;correctional facility&quot;. They also didn't
ask about parole officers, prison wardens and prison &quot;counselors&quot;,
and other legal authorities who also routinely force people into Alcoholics Anonymous participation.

<a name="early_coercion"> </a>
Alcoholics Anonymous has been practicing coercive recruiting since
Day One. The book <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i> describes how Dr. Bob
and Bill Wilson shoved their
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Oxford Group cult religion</a>
&quot;treatment&quot; on A.A. Number Three, Bill Dotson, when he was in
the hospital in Akron, Ohio:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... they thought it a good idea to have a preliminary talk with his wife.
And this became part of the way things were done in the early days: Discuss
it first with the wife; find out what you could; then plan your approach.
It should be noted, as well, that the alcoholic himself didn't ask for help.
He didn't have anything to say about it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 1980, pages 82-83.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob actually felt entitled to shove their own
cult religion on other alcoholics regardless of the patient's wishes or
beliefs &#8212; &quot;for his own good&quot; &#8212; the patient didn't get any
say in the matter. (That is still the attitude of many so-called counselors
and therapists today.)

<p>
And since
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. does not actually work
to make people get and stay sober</a>, A.A. cannot rationalize that it
was done for their own good.

<!---------------------------------------------------
(In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" target="_blank">recent research has
shown that the sponsorship system was completely ineffective</a> when
it came to helping newcomers, although it helped the oldtimer sponsors
to stay sober. So A.A. and N.A. were exploiting the newcomers for the
benefit of the oldtimers.)

Recently, Jake Ginsky of the <i>Boulder Weekly</i> described a clever round-about
way to force people into Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings:
<p>
<ul>
<li> There's big money to be made in diagnosing kids who only dabbled with drugs
a couple of times as hard-core addicts, in need of imprisonment and
residential treatment. And once in there, the parents can't even get
their children back because the staff &quot;experts&quot; say that the
kids need treatment. And it's also a cute way to force either the kids
or their parents or both to go to Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or Al-Anon
12-step meetings, as part of the &quot;treatment&quot; program.

<li> There are tens of thousands of adolescents whom a raft of experts
say are coerced into entering drug treatment each year by schools, parents
or the courts, despite not having any serious drug problem.
<li> Joel Brown of the Center for Educational Research and Development
estimates that &quot;less than 10 percent&quot; of the kids who enter
treatment at the insistence of their schools actually have problems.

<a name="self_seeking"> </a>
Bill Wilson constantly complained that alcoholics exhibited immense
selfishness, and Bill's solution to the problem was to get everybody
working &quot;selflessly&quot; to recruit more A.A. members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Selfishness &#8212; self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root
of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion,
self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows
and they retaliate. &nbsp; ...<br>
... the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though
he usually doesn't think so. Above everything, we alcoholics
must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kills us!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous, 3rd Edition</i>,

<p>
Those terms, &quot;self sacrifice&quot; and
&quot;unselfish, constructive action&quot;
are so vague and generic that they could mean anything that Mr. Wilson
or A.A. want them to mean.  And Bill usually wanted them to mean,
<font color="#4f007f">

And there is a guilt-inducing accusation implied there: <i>&quot;Your
faith isn't vital because you are selfish.&quot;</i><br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i><b>&quot;So quit being selfish. Go recruiting for us. Go get us some more
'babies' and 'pigeons' if you want your faith to work.&quot;</b></i>
</font>
<p>
Note that getting new cult members out recruiting soon is called
&quot;actionizing&quot;, and it's a common cult characteristic.
Actionizing is just another flavor of the propaganda stunt called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#selfsell" target="_blank">self-sell</a>&quot; &#8212; get people
to sell themselves on whatever you are trying to sell them.
New cult members sell themselves on the cult and its dogma
while trying to convert others, so the cult benefits from such
recruiting activities twice &#8212; the recruiting work
gets the cult more new recruits, and it also
helps to indoctrinate and convince the recent recruits.

<p>
A hidden aspect of all of this recruiting is that A.A. is actually
an enormously selfish program. The talk about getting rid of selfishness
is hypocritical. Everything in the A.A. program is about <b><i>&quot;my
sobriety.&quot;</i></b> Members go recruiting because they are taught that
they will lose their sobriety &#8212;
that they will relapse and die drunk &#8212;
if they don't spend all of their spare time recruiting and teaching newcomers.
(That is use of the propaganda tricks of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#emotions" target="_blank">fear mongering</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">induction of phobias</a>.)
In addition, some of the status of older A.A. members is based on how
many newcomers they have recruited and sponsored.
So A.A. members are doing it for themselves as much as for the other alcoholics.

<p><hr width="50%"><p><br>

Theoretically, <a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">the Eleventh Tradition</a>
of Alcoholics Anonymous,
which states that A.A. is a program of attraction, not promotion,
bans such proselytizing. But A.A. members do it anyway. Even Bill Wilson
himself as much as told A.A. members to ignore Tradition Eleven in order
to build up the A.A. organization:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To reach more alcoholics, understanding of A.A. and public good will
towards A.A. must go on growing everywhere. We need to be on still
better terms with medicine, religion, employers, governments, courts,
prisons, mental hospitals, and all enterprises in the alcoholism
field. We need the increasing good will of editors, writers,
television and radio channels. These publicity outlets need to be
opened ever wider.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><b>Twelve Concepts for World Service</b>, William G. Wilson,
page 54.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a program of promotion, not attraction.
And Bill Wilson and gang did break the Eleventh Tradition whenever
it suited their purposes, making radio broadcasts, and
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">touring the
country, grandstanding and promoting A.A.</a>. Bill Wilson got
his story and
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#newspaper_picture" target="_blank">
picture printed in the newspapers</a> so many times that
by 1944 he was the most famous &quot;anonymous&quot; person in the
USA. And then he and Marty Mann even went and testified before Congress,
pushing Alcoholics Anonymous as the solution to the nation's alcohol
problem. That's promotion. And that's also breaking anonymity.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous Tradition Eleven says,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Our public relations should be guided by the principle of
<font color="#9F0000">attraction rather than promotion</font>;
we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level
of press, radio, and films.&quot;</b></font><br>
<p>
But A.A. has always been conducting a promotion campaign ever since the very first days.
In the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
Bill Wilson calls missionary work to distant cities and countries
&quot;pioneering&quot;, and says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Pioneering in A.A. of course has not stopped. I hope it never will.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 80.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Jack_Alexander"> </a>
And Bill Wilson rationalized his promotion of A.A. in this story by declaring
that good publicity about A.A. &quot;does not manufacture itself.&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Years ago we found that accurate and effective publicity about A.A. simply does
not manufacture itself. Our over-all public relations couldn't be left entirely to
chance encounters between reporters and A.A. members, who might or might not
be well informed about our fellowship as a whole.
This kind of unorganized &quot;simpliticity&quot; often garbled
the true story of A.A. and kept people away from us. A badly slanted press could
prolong preventable suffering and even result in unnecessary deaths.
<p>
When in 1941 the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> assigned Jack Alexander to scout
A.A. for a feature story, we had already learned our lesson. Therefore nothing
was left to chance. Had Jack been able to get to St. Louis for the Convention
he himself could have told how skeptical he had been of this assignment.
He had just finished doing a piece on the Jersey rackets, and he didn't believe
anybody on a stack of Bibles a mile high.
<p>
After Jack checked in with us at Headquarters, we took him in tow for nearly a whole
month. In order to write his powerful article, he had to have our fullest attention
and carefully organized help. We gave him our records, opened the books, introduced him
to nonalcoholic Trustees, fixed up interviews with A.A.'s of every description,
and finally showed him the A.A. sights from New York and Philadelphia all the way
to Chicago, via Akron and Cleveland. Although he was not an alcoholic, Jack soon
became a true A.A. convert in spirit. When at last he sat down at his typewriter,
his heart was in it. He was no longer on the outside of A.A. looking in;
he was really inside looking out. &nbsp; ...
<p>
The kind of help we gave Jack Alexander &#8212; our organized service of public
information &#8212; is the vital ingredient in our public relations that most A.A.'s
have never seen. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; Could this be a ballyhooed promotion stunt,
something quite contrary to A.A. traditions?

a piece of industrial-strength cult religion propaganda. Anybody who could
edit and approve of that text was not a neutral reporter at all.
He was a religious fanatic and a genuine nut-case.

<i>The Group Hides What Membership In The Group Will Eventually Entail.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer lists this item as one of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">the key characteristics
of a destructive cult</a>.
The group does not tell newcomers
what the group is really about and what will be required of members if they join.
Cults usually have dual purposes &#8212; they advertise one purpose to the public, and
keep their other purpose hidden.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous has a hidden agenda. It advertises that it exists to
help people quit drinking, but its hidden goal is to convert them to Bill Wilson's
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="newwin098">Buchmanite</a> religious beliefs:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the
spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them.
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font>
is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, pages 76-77.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So the <i>real purpose</i> of Alcoholics Anonymous is to get people to
<i>Seek and Do the Will of God</i>.
Quitting drinking seems to be a secondary goal.
But they don't tell new recruits about that in the beginning.
They just emphasize the need to quit drinking.

Similarly, Al-Anon advertises on the radio that

They don't tell you that you won't get your life back &#8212; that their

<p>
Bill Wilson continued, rationalizing why A.A. members should hide the religious
nature of Alcoholics Anonymous from outsiders while doing the 9th and 10th steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is seldom wise to approach an individual, who still smarts from our injustice
to him, and announce that we have gone religious. In the prize ring,
this would be called leading with the chin. Why lay ourselves open to being
branded fanatics or religious bores?
We may kill a future opportunity to carry a beneficial message.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, page 77.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
When Bill speaks of
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;a future opportunity to carry a beneficial message&quot;</font>,
what that really means is,
<font color="#9F0000"><i>&quot;a future chance to recruit the individual who
still smarts from our injustice.&quot;</i></font>
Bill was always scheming to enlarge his cult.
<p>
In chapter 7 of the <i>Big Book</i> &#8212; the A.A. recruiting manual &#8212; Bill Wilson
told recruiters not to alarm new prospects by talking about the <!-- intensely -->
religious nature of the Alcoholics Anonymous program:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or
atheist, make it emphatic that <i>he does not have to agree with
your conception of God</i>.<br>
&nbsp; ... <br>
There is no use arousing any prejudice he may have against certain
theological terms and conceptions about which he may already be confused.
Don't raise such issues, no matter what your own convictions are.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 93.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Why stress <i>&quot;the spiritual feature&quot;</i> freely?<br>
Because you
aren't supposed to stress
<font color="#9F0000"><i>the religious feature</i></font>.<br>
Keep on yammering,
<font color="#8f00bf">&quot;It's spiritual, not religious&quot;</font>
when the prospect says,
<font color="blue">&quot;I don't want to join a religion.&quot;</font>
<p>
(Note how Bill implied that non-members were
&quot;prejudiced&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; about religion.
As usual, Bill declared that he had all of the true answers about God,
life, and everything, and anyone who disagreed with him was ignorant,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudiced</a>,
and &quot;confused about certain theological terms and conceptions&quot;.)
<p>

The statements:
<font color="#8f00bf">
<b><i>&quot;make it emphatic that he does not have to agree with
your conception of God&quot;</i></b>
</font>
and
<font color="#8f00bf">
<b><i>&quot;Don't raise such issues&quot;</i></b>
</font>
are instructing the recruiter to deceive the prospect, to hide the
intense religiosity of Alcoholics Anonymous from him.
In the end, the prospect will have to agree with A.A. about God.
<a href="orange-letters10.html#any_God" target="_blank">It is impossible to work the Twelve Steps
without believing in the A.A. version of God</a>.
But newcomers are not told that up front.

Bill Wilson taught
recruiters to dole out the truth about the Alcoholics Anonymous program
only a little bit at a time,
dispensing only as much true information about A.A. as the new prospect
could tolerate, just a teaspoonful or less, but never more:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.

When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only
little by little. They simply did not want to get &quot;too good
too soon.&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank">
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts</a> &#8212; absolute
purity, absolute honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212;
were frequently too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed
with teaspoons rather than by buckets.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson was certainly arrogant enough.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Just wanting to quit drinking was not nearly good enough
for Bill Wilson &#8212; the newcomers to A.A. also had to share Bill's extreme
religious beliefs &#8212; which were those of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups</a> &#8212;
but Bill Wilson hid that ugly fact from the newcomers.

<p>
<li>
Then Bill even sneered at the newcomers who did not wish to join his
version of the Oxford Group religion, by saying that they didn't want
to &quot;get too good too soon&quot;, and implying that
they were wrong &#8212; &quot;defective&quot; &#8212; for not liking the
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">fascist authoritarian nature</a>
of Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups.

<!----------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<LI>
Finally Bill Wilson and his henchmen even
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">sentenced men to an alcoholic death</a>
for refusing to believe in Bill's religious raving.

<p>

Note the deception inherent in that program:

Bill Wilson hid the Oxford Group origins

<p>
<li> Bill Wilson declared that he could foist Oxford Group religious beliefs on
his alcoholic recruits if he just used different names for things &#8212;
&quot;different terminology&quot; &#8212; so that the
new recruits would not recognize the Buchmanism right away.
<p>
<li> Bill Wilson cleverly fed the authoritarian Buchmanism to

&#8212; &quot;The Four Absolutes&quot; &#8212; for people to follow.
That is another standard cult practice. They make you feel
guilty and inadequate because you can't live up to their super-human
standards of perfection
&#8212; <i>&quot;absolute purity, absolute honesty, absolute

<a name="time_enough_later"> </a>
Hiding the true nature of A.A. has been the standard recruiting strategy since
the very earliest days of Alcoholics Anonymous.
The A.A. history book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, by Bill Wilson,
described the debate surrounding
the creation of the <i>Big Book</i>, <i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>,
where the early A.A.
members debated about how much truth to tell to the public:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Fitz wanted a powerfully religious document; Henry and Jimmy would have none of it.
They wanted a psychological book which would lure the reader in; when
he finally arrived among us, there would then be enough time to tip him
off about the spiritual character of our society. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; As umpire of these
disputes, I was obliged to go pretty much down the middle, writing in
spiritual rather than religious or entirely psychological terms.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>
(1957), William G. Wilson, page 17.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, Bill says, he compromised and downplayed the
religious nature of the organization, and only told part of the truth, in
order to &quot;lure the reader in&quot;:
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religious organization&quot;</i></font>, and
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It's spiritual, not religious&quot;</font></i>, and
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous requires no beliefs&quot;</i></font>.
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;There will be time enough to reveal the religious nature of A.A. to the
newcomers later on, after they have finally arrived among us...&quot;</i>
</font>
</ul>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Also notice how cutely Bill Wilson blamed his dishonesty
on the other A.A. members, rationalizing that he had to do what they said.
What happened to
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#too_good_too_soon" target="_blank"><i>Bill Wilson The Moral Giant</i></a>,
and Bill the leader who was so much better than his fellow alcoholics, and
Bill the spiritual teacher who practiced the Oxford Group's
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank"><i>Four Absolutes</i></a>,
like <i>Absolute Honesty</i>, when the other alcoholics were not good enough to do so?)
</font>
<p>
See the web page
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">Recruiting Mind Games</a>&quot;</i>
for the details of those deceptive recruiting practices.<br>
See the letters web pages for a description of how
<a href="orange-letters4.html#hide_God" target="_blank">A.A. old-timers still do that
to newcomers today</a>.


<p><br>
A.A. also uses numerous
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch stunts</a> to
deceive newcomers and &quot;keep coming back&quot; until they are sufficiently
indoctrinated to be told the real truth.  Like: telling people that
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">It isn't religious,
it's spiritual</a>&quot;,
or telling people that they
can have any Higher Power, or any God as they understand Him, and
then, only later, revealing
the fact that a new member must believe in
a very specific kind of dictatorial God who will receive
confessions and miraculously remove
&quot;defects of character,&quot; including the desire to drink alcohol;
a God Who has a very strong Will and Who literally
dictates orders to members &#8212; those members
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">
who sit quietly and listen for God to broadcast his dictates</a>.

And then the newcomers find out that
they are supposed to spend the rest of their lives following the
orders of that Dictator, and they are supposed to spend the
rest of their lives dependent upon A.A. for instructions in
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#freedom2think" target="_blank">what
to do and what to think</a>.
That's quite a progression, from complete freedom of religion
to complete slavery.

<p>
See the file on
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">The Bait-and-Switch Con Game</a>&quot;</i>
for many more ways in which A.A. hides from newcomers what membership in A.A. will
really entail, including:
<ul>
<li> First, A.A. is just a nice
neighborhood quit-drinking self-help group, and then
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spirit_rel" target="_blank">
it's a hard-core fundamentalist religion</a>.
<p>
<li> First, they will tell you that you can
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what" target="_blank">Take what you want,
and leave the rest</a>.&quot;</i>
<br>
Then they will tell you that you can't ever leave.<br>
And then it gets even worse &#8212; Then they say that you <i>must</i> do all of Bill Wilson's
Twelve Steps, all of the time,
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#death_warrant" target="_blank"> or else you will die</a>.

<p>
<li> First, the bait offered to the prospective new member
(&quot;prospect&quot;) is
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod" target="_blank">a promise of complete religious
freedom</a>,
and then the switch comes later, when the new member finds that
he must accept the A.A. beliefs and
<a href="orange-recruit.html#believer" target="_blank">discard his own</a>.
<p>
<li> First, the goal is to quit drinking, and then
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives" target="_blank">the goal is to believe in God
and serve God</a>.
<p>
<li> First, any religious beliefs are okay, and then
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#only_Wilsons_beliefs" target="_blank">only Mr. Wilson's
religious beliefs are good enough</a>.

<p>
<li> First it's &quot;Surrender to God&quot; and then
it's &quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#surrender2AA" target="_blank">surrender
to some A.A. members</a>&quot;.

<p>
<li> First, it's any <i>&quot;God as we understood Him&quot;</i>,
and then it's
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education" target="_blank">You don't understand
God</a>.&quot;</i>

</ul>

<p>
Lastly, institutional A.A./N.A. routinely advertises itself as the
best and only successful drug and
alcohol treatment program, without ever revealing that the
expensive treatment program is little more
than an indoctroduction to the A.A./N.A. 12-step cult religion,
and without revealing that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">the
&quot;treatment&quot; works about the same as no treatment at all</a>.
Hiding the fact that the A.A. program does not work to sober up
alcoholics is the biggest deception of all.

<p>
Being able to tell the truth presupposes that
there are people who want to hear the truth, and who will tolerate hearing it,
and there are far too few of those people around. There are many things
you can't openly share in meetings, starting with:
<ul>
<p>
<li> &quot;I don't practice the Twelve Steps. I use
just one rule: 'Just never drink alcohol, not
any at all, not ever, no matter what.'&quot;
<p>
<li>
&quot;A.A. has too much cult religion stuff in it.&quot;
<p>
<li>
&quot;I avoid the Twelve Steps just like I
avoid toxic waste dumps, and for the same
reason: I don't want to get poisoned.&quot;
</ul>

<p> If that doesn't start a war, try:
<ul>
<p>
<li> &quot;I don't do the 12 steps, I don't have a sponsor, and I
don't believe in the Big Book, but I'm successfully staying sober anyway.&quot;
<p>
<li> &quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps don't work</a>.
The Twelve Steps of Bill Wilson are twelve of the
stupidest steps for achieving sobriety that any brain-damaged

nothing to do with staying sober.

like some sober, mature, adults, then you have found a wonderful
group that I've never heard of.
(Or else you walked into one of the secular, rational recovery kinds
of meetings, like SMART or SOS or WFS...)
<p>
The A.A. true believers actually feel like you are being unfair if you
tell the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous. And, they say, you might &quot;confuse those who
could have been helped.&quot;
&quot;Not In Front of the Newcomers&quot; is a common
AA slogan for halting any criticism of the A.A. &quot;program&quot;.

<p>
Note the glaring contradiction between not being able to tell the truth
and the constantly-repeated claim that
<font color="#4f007f">
success in Alcoholics Anonymous
requires &quot;grasping and developing a manner of living which
demands rigorous honesty.&quot;
</font>
(The <i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)
That hypocritical statement is read out loud at the start of
every A.A. meeting.

It's interesting to watch newcomers learn what to say when
they &quot;share.&quot; Some beginners will say that
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">they don't like all of the praying and God talk</a>,
that it isn't for them &#8212; that they just want to
quit drinking. Those remarks are always met with a stony silence.
Someone sidles up to them after the
meeting, and lets them know that the
proper behavior is to keep those opinions to oneself, and
&quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;, and go through
the motions and pretend to have no problems with all of the
religious stuff.
<p>
In A.A., you can disagree all you want just as long as you don't say it
out loud. I've never heard a beginner voice objections to all of the
religiosity twice.
Most of those beginners never returned, but nobody ever voiced
those objections out loud twice.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
A corollary to not being able to tell the truth is not being able to ask for the truth.
If you question &quot;The Program&quot;, and ask for the true facts, like the actual
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#coins" target="_blank">A.A. recovery rate</a>,
or the
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">cult religion history of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>,
you will get standard slogan responses: 
&quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth,&quot; or
&quot;Keep it simple stupid,&quot; or &quot;It was your best thinking that got
you here,&quot; or &quot;Keep your own side of the street clean,&quot; or
&quot;When you point a finger at others, there are three pointed back at you,&quot;
or &quot;You are in denial.&quot;
Ask a candid question, get a canned answer.

<i>Cloning &#8212; You become a clone of the group leader or other elder group members.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
In A.A., the cloning is not as obvious as in other cults that wear strange foreign uniforms
or unusual hair styles.
Here, the cloning is internal and mental.
You must adopt a new identity, which is &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
You must become a Stepper. You new last name will be &quot;alcoholic&quot;,
as in <i>&quot;Hi. My name is Harry, and I'm an alcoholic.&quot;</i>
No matter what you may have thought of yourself before A.A., you will end up
talking about yourself in terms of the stereotypical alchoholic &#8212; declaring that
you are full of resentments and &quot;powerless&quot; over your &quot;spiritual disease&quot;,
and how you are selfish, self-seeking, egotistical, &quot;sitting on the pity pot&quot;,
and suffering from sundry other &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character.&quot;
You will learn that you have all of the same &quot;character defects&quot; as the A.A. founder
Bill Wilson. In fact, you are just like him.

One of the standard A.A. slogans is &quot;Don't compare &#8212;
Identify!&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
The newcomers are supposed to eventually come to consider themselves to be
alcoholics no different from all the rest of the membership of A.A.:

<blockquote>
<font face="Courier">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I was in the A.A. program about 9 months before I could admit I was an
alcoholic. I really did not like that word. At meetings, the speakers talked
about what they had done, the jails that they had been in, the institutions,
jobs they had lost.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I wasn't identifying with any of these things. One day, a guy said at a meeting
that it wasn't the things that he had done that had caused him to come to A.A.
and to realize that he was an alcoholic, but the things that he neglected to
do as a result of his drinking. And from that day until today I have never
had any problems in saying that I was an alcoholic. (44-F-18/w)
</font>
</blockquote>

Because of this initial tendency to look for differences, the counsel to newcomers
has been summed up in another simple phrase, &quot;Don't compare &#8212; identify!&quot;
It is through identifying with others that most newcomers to A.A. learn what
an alcoholic is and become able to face up to the reality that this is what they are:

<blockquote>
<font face="Courier">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
By listening to a lot of the people I heard speak I started to identify with
them. I realized I was very similar to them, and if they were alcoholics,
I was too. (39-M-0/9)

Excuse me, but who says that all alcoholic newcomers have
&quot;defensive, egocentric shells&quot;
and don't care about other people? That is just
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">another A.A. stereotype
of &quot;The Alcoholic&quot;</a>.
Nevertheless, the proper new A.A. clone will proudly declare that he
was that way, before he got fixed by the program.

<p>
A.A. is just one huge crazy belief system.
The price of admission to the club is that you must <i>&quot;come to
believe&quot;</i> what they believe.
<p>
Bill Wilson deceptively declared that you don't have to believe
anything when you join A.A. &#8212; that you are free to believe whatever you
wish, but the truth is just the opposite.
<ul>
<li> First, Bill told the newcomers that they didn't need to believe anything in particular,
and then he told them to quit thinking and just be gullible:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.
All of its Twelve Steps are but suggestions. &nbsp; ...
all you really need is a truly open mind. Just resign from the debating society
and quit bothering yourself with such deep questions as whether it was the hen
or the egg that came first. Again I say, all you need is the open mind.&quot;<br>

But then, <i>on the very next page</i>, Bill pulled a bait-and-switch
stunt, and declared that the goal of the A.A. program was to acquire
faith in his religion, and to
<font color="#9F0000"><i>come to believe</i></font>
in his version of God: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I must quickly assure you that A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest for faith. ...
You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your 'higher power.' Here's a very large group of
people who have solved their alcohol problem. In this respect they are certainly a power
greater than you, who have not even come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in
them. Even this minimum of faith will be enough. You will find many members who have crossed
the threshold just this way. All of them will tell you that, once across, their faith
broadened and deepened. Relieved of the alcohol obsession, their lives unaccountably
transformed, they came to believe in a Higher Power, and most of them began to talk of
God.<br>

In Alcoholics Anonymous, you must <b><i>come to believe</i></b> many things:
<ul>
<li> Step One: You must believe that you are powerless over alcohol, and incapable
of managing your own life.
<li> Step Two: <i>[We] Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</i> So you must believe that you are insane.
<li> You must believe in God, and you must believe in a particular version
of God Who cares about how insane you are, and how much you drink.
<li> You must believe that it's okay with God for you to abdicate your
role in life and <i>turn your will and your life over to the
care of &quot;God as we understood Him&quot;</i> in Step Three.
<li> You must believe in a Higher Power who will micro-manage the world and
change physical reality to do favors for you.
<li> You must believe that God really wants to spend all of His time
taking care of you in Step Three.
<li> You must believe that God really wants to hear your confessions.
<li> You must believe that years of constantly wallowing in guilt and confessing your
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot; will be therapeutic and helpful, rather than drive you crazy.
<li> You must believe that God will answer your demand for a miracle
and remove your shortcomings in Step Seven.
<li> You must believe that God has a Will and wants you to be His
slave and do specific jobs for him.
<li> You must believe that God will talk to you and tell you what to do
in Step Eleven, and also give you the
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#sure_power" target="_blank">sure power</a>&quot; to do it.
(And you must believe that the voices in your head are really God talking,
and not delusions.)
<li> You must believe that Twelfth-Step work &#8212; recruiting more people into
Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; even by
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive</a> or
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">coercive</a>
means &#8212; is a good thing to do.
<li> You must believe that the Twelve Steps actually work and accomplish something
positive.

<li> You must believe that Bill Wilson was sane and good &#8212; and not a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">vicious raving lunatic</a>,
a <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#few_weeks" target="_blank">compulsive liar</a>,
a <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">thieving con man</a>,
and a <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">sexual predator</a>.
<li> And you must believe that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#denied_recovery" target="_blank">the grandiose,
grossly unrealistic and bombastic things</a>
that Bill wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> (and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#12X12" target="_blank">12X12</a>)
are something more than the scribblings of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">a deluded mad man</a>.
</ul>
<p>
And you must accept and believe all of that without question. The <i>Big Book</i>
goes on to tell us that:

A.A. scores an 8.<br>
<p>
A.A. states that its end goal is a wonderful life of sobriety, spirituality,
and &quot;rigourous honesty&quot;, and in order to get there, it is willing to
&quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;, and &quot;Act As If&quot;, and practice deceptive recruiting,
and withhold information from the newcomers...

<p>
A.A. has an easy rationalization for its behavior:
&quot;It will save the alcoholics' lives.&quot;
Also, &quot;It will bring them closer to God,&quot;
and, &quot;It will get them to Seek and Do the Will of God.&quot;
<p>
A.A. rationalizes a lot of stuff: abusive treatment of new recruits,
illegal, unconstitutional coerced attendance,
fanatical adherence to dogma, deceptive recruiting, irrationality,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
gross distortion of the &quot;success rate&quot;</a>,
and hiding the real history of Alcoholics Anonymous and its founders,
just to name a few items.
