From:  	&quot;Andrew S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re:<br>

<p>
Orange, you do not understand my central point.

<p>
Yes, AA is an objectively failed treatment for alcoholism. I agree with you
100% on that point.

<p>
When you distort the truth and claim to be in an expert in a field that you
have no credentials or experience in, you lose personal integrity and honor
EVEN IF YOUR CENTRAL THESIS IS TRUE.

<p>
It would be irresponsible of me to give medical advice to people, even if
it generally would correlate with a doctor's diagnosis. Why? I don't have
the experience or resources to react appropriately if an emergency arises.
I don't have a legal duty to protect the people seeking my advice. I don't
have liability insurance, etc.

<p>
Your central thesis is true; but your supporting arguments are biased,
non-objective propaganda against AA presented in a angry, hostile and
paranoid tone.

<p>
In the short term, the goal of the addict or alcoholic is to solve their
immediate lifestyle problems. In the long-term it is to gain perspective
and self-actualization in their own life. Using distortion, bias and
dishonesty is dangerous in the long-term for people. We should strive to
see things for what they are, not for what we fear them to be or what we
wish them to be.

<p>
It is foolish, reckless distortion to lump AA with the Nazi party or the
Jim Jones People's Church. A.A. does not recruit deceptively. A.A. does not
hide what membership eventually will entail. Members can leave at any
point. A.A. focuses on helping people grow, while cults use their members
to promote the growth of the cult and increase the cult leader's power and
wealth.

<p>
Your characterization of AA as a cult is a distorted, biased piece of
wishful thinking, not objective journalism. If this were polished,
professional journalism, you would be able to publish it in Harper's or The
Atlantic.

<p>
Yes, the AA process is ineffective. But its aim isn't to elevate the
president of AA to riches and fame. AA is not a cult. It is a mis-guided
and ineffective program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Andrew,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
This is the core of your complaint:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Your central thesis is true; but your supporting arguments are biased,

<br>

<p>
You agree that I am right when I say that A.A. does not work, and you just complain about
my writing style as I criticize A.A.?

<p>
Well, since A.A. doesn't work, and is just wasting people's time, money, and lives,
and knowingly lying about its success rate, don't you think some hostility is in order?
Such behavior is beneath contempt.
Knowingly foisting quack medicine on sick people is really a low, vile, crime.

<p>
Then you  declared,
<p>
<blockquote>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is grossly, totally wrong.
<ol>
<li> The first assumption of the Nazi philosophy is that the average
man is incompetent and cannot be trusted to think for himself, so he should just obey a superior leader,
and the highest duty of a citizen is to obey orders.

<p><li>
Then the Nazi sympathizer Dr. Frank Buchman came along and declared that you have been
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchmanite_tenets" target="_blank">defeated by sin</a>,
and that your only salvation was to
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender" target="_blank">surrender to God</a>
and
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#obey_Buchman" target="_blank">obey God</a>.
But then he declared that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">you are incompetent to hear the Voice of God because you are so sinful</a>, so you should just do what your
sponsor and other Oxford Group elders tell you to do.

<p><li>
Then
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson came along and copied Buchman</a>
and declared that you have been defeated by alcohol, and only surrender to
God will save you, and you must spend your life following the dictates of God. 
But since you are &quot;thinking alcoholically&quot;,
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#fooled_ourselves" target="_blank">you are not qualified to hear the Voice of God</a>
telling you what to do in Step 11, so you should just do what your sponsor tells you to do.

<p><li>
It's all the same garbage. It's all about making slaves of the little people.
<p><li>
Then, the fact that Dr. Frank Buchman went to
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg" target="_blank">Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies</a>
year after year as the personal guest of the Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler is just frosting on the cake.
Just like Frank Buchman returning to New York from the 1936 Berlin Olympics and declaring,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#praise_Hitler2" target="_blank">&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;</a>

</ol>
<p>
There is nothing unfair about comparing Alcoholics Anonymous to Rev. Jim Jones' People's Temple.
Have you actually read any books about the People's Temple? The parallels with A.A. are appalling
and quite striking. It's the same put-downs: &quot;You are sinful and weak and inherently evil, and only
following the leader will save you.&quot;
You can start your reading with
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>.
You can also check out the list of books about The People's Temple in the bibliography,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Jim_Jones" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Then, the rest of that paragraph is a list of untrue statements, and denial:
<ol>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">A.A. does recruit deceptively</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">A.A. does hide from prospective recruits what membership entails</a>.

<p><li>
A.A. says that you cannot leave. If you leave, your fate will be &quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death.&quot; And,
&quot;If you leave, you will come back on your knees.&quot; Thus, they use
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">Phobia Induction</a>
and death threats to keep people in the cult.

<p>
Also, what about all of the people who are sentenced to A.A. by a judge, parole officer, or &quot;counselor&quot; or
&quot;therapist&quot; or &quot;half-way house&quot;? They are not free to leave.

<p><li> A.A. does not &quot;focus on helping people grow.&quot; That is a delusional fairy tale, and just
another standard P.R. slogan.

Right now, there is a big debate going on over at &quot;The FIX&quot; web site about the
rape of underage girls in A.A.
That is hardly helping people to attain sobriety or &quot;self-actualization&quot;.
<p>
Again, because A.A. does not work, foisting ineffective quack medicine on sick people is not &quot;helping them to grow&quot;
or &quot;helping them to self-actualize&quot;. It's all just
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">a Big Lie</a>.

<p><li>
The last part of the last sentence is true:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Cults use their members
to promote the growth of the cult and increase the cult leader's power and
wealth.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, and that is what A.A. has been doing for the last 75 years.
You have admitted that A.A. does not work, and yet they work tirelessly to promote A.A. and sucker in
more victims, to get more A.A. members, and money, and power. They don't care that the A.A. &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;program&quot; does not actually work. They don't care how many people get hurt. That is a cult.
</ol>

<p>
Lastly, you declared,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Yes, the AA process is ineffective. But its aim isn't to elevate the president of AA to riches and fame.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sorry, but that is wrong again.
<a href="orange-letters272.html#Greg_Muth" target="_blank">The previous President of A.A. Greg Muth
was raking in $250,000 per year</a>
while he
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">sued poor A.A. members in Mexico and Germany</a>
to get more illegal money.
And Muth quietly slipped $469,000 to his lawyer friend Thomas Jasper
as a going-away present. It looks like those criminals took A.A. for everything that they could get.
<p>
(There is much more on the A.A. financial affairs

Thanks for everything you have done. My friend/acquaintance is taking a
course, to work with alcoholics although I wouldn't call her qualified. I
sent her a few copies of things on your site and she said her teacher would
freak out if she showed him that. It makes me sick  &#8212;  a $15,000.00 course to
learn A.A. is the only answer. They have 18-year-olds taking the course if
they can afford it. Some things never change. It really makes me livid some
time. Hope all is going well for you. Thanks for all you do.

Hello C R,

Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.

Isn't that attitude really appalling? &quot;You can't tell the truth.&quot;
That is the essence of a cult.

&quot;Yes, we have this wonderful religious &#8212;

<p>
And yes, it is sad that the course will just crank out more incompetent counselors with certificates.
Straw-headed scarecrows with diplomas (as in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>). Or
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Christina" target="_blank">coke-snorting child-rapers who are certified drug-and-alcohol counselors</a>.

Why don't the students sue the school for fraud? Unless they are totally blind, they must eventually
see that they got taught a bunch of nonsense, and were cheated out of their money.

<p>
Sorry about your egg. Hopefully, it really is just a slow egg.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
I am keeping the egg warm &#8212; just in case &#8212; but I'm not holding my breath.
Yes, it's disappointing. I was hoping for a cute little fluff-ball to care for.
Oh well, maybe next year.

</font>
<p>
I know exactly the sort of &quot;therapists&quot; you're talking about. My worst
one was actually a high school guidance counselor. Now, your average
counselor is mostly qualified to tell students to go to college. They're
pretty useless with actual trouble. This one was only an exception in
the sense she was worse than useless. She acted like she had
qualifications she didn't have by playing therapist, made some home
drama and my then-undiagnosed depression worse, and had the nerve to
complain when my grades didn't magically go up. Fortunately, she lost
her job. Unfortunately, not before I ended up kicked out of school. And
no, she would not let me stop seeing her.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh brother. You have my sympathy.
<p>
It reminds me of the Spam Song (Monte Python)  &#8212;  &quot;spam everywhere&quot;. Except that
in this case it's incompetence everywhere.
</font>
<p>
I don't have to worry about the Warm Springs thing for quite a while. I
do need to get a different VR counselor first, since the current one is
too far away from where my mother is moving to. Going by what little
information I have, there's really no therapy involved, just helping
disabled people acquire job skills and training. In this case, having a
lot of psychobabble involved is a red flag. The one red flag in my mind
right now is I could be there indefinitely. It wouldn't be a red flag if
I have the ability to leave before they decide I should. And
theoretically, I should be able to, since the stated goal is to make
people with disabilities more independent. Let's see if that matches
with reality.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that sounds suspicious. If they don't do psychotherapy, then why the
psychobabble? Are they trying to fool the public into believing that they
are offering treatment and services that they don't?
Or are they hiding an agenda to &quot;reform&quot; the clients?
<p>
What I am most suspicious of in places like that is the condescending attitude of the staff.
They start off pretending to be respectful of their clients,
but that changes when the P.R. mask comes off.
The same thing happens in many old peoples' homes.
And in most drug and alcohol &quot;treatment centers&quot;.

</font>
<p>
There are other options that would allow me to stay with my family. If
Warm Springs passes the test, then it would have the most resources
available for me. That's a big if, though.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. Good luck.
</font>
<p>
Anyhow, it's late here. I hope the egg hatches. Is it still generating
its own heat? That's a good sign it's still alive, since dead things
don't do that. Maybe it's going to share a birthday (May 30) with me.

<p>
<font color="blue">
With 20-20 hindsight, I don't think it was generating its own heat. I think what
I was seeing was the difference in temperature between a probe placed underneath
the egg and one beside it. The one underneath was pressed against the cloth and
got the heat coming up from below. The probe beside the egg was getting the
air temperature around the egg, which was less.
<p>
I am also beginning to think that perhaps the change in coloration of the egg shell
was due to decay, rather than development.
<p>
I am beginning to wonder if the egg was ever alive. Was it even fertilized?
If the crippled mother had a mate, where was he?
The whole thing may well be a lesson in how easy it is to get fooled by appearances.
<p>
Still, I'm keeping the egg warm a while longer, just in case.
It's against all odds, but strange things do happen. The &quot;Family of 5&quot; goslings
just became 6. About two weeks after hatching out their original five, the mother
managed to get a slow egg to hatch, and now they have this extra-little cute fluff-ball.
I know what happened there. Sometimes the mother lays one more egg after she
starts sitting on her clutch. That egg will always be behind the others. When the rest
of the brood hatches out, the mother takes them out to forage for food,
and the remaining egg is left cool during the day. It doesn't develop any further while
it is cool, so it falls further behind. The geese are out and about for two-thirds
of the day, and only return to the nest to warm the remaining egg at night, so
its development is really slowed down, and it gets later and later.
Still, if the mother keeps on coming back to the nest and sitting
on the egg at night, the slow egg can eventually
hatch, like happened in the Family of 5
(which is now &quot;The Family of 5+1&quot;).
<p>
But my egg was never left cool all day long, so I don't see any reason for it to be
so late.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	Religious background?<br>

<p>
Hi, Orange.
<p>
  First let me say I found your site, one day after entering
an outpatient program, who lied to me about their program, as I
specifically told them I had many objections to AA meetings.   I stayed
with the program and learned a few good things, but otherwise did not
buy their program.  With the help of your website I was able to reaffirm
my suspicions and then SOME.  Thank you for your service to those who
really do keep an open mind (&quot;brains not falling out&quot;).

<p>
For my question:  I &quot;had&quot; a fairly religious (middle of the road
Methodist) upbringing, and right away I felt some things were very wrong
with their 12 step approach.  I have read the various stats on who goes
to AA, who has best chances for success in treatments, but I was
wondering if a strong religious background has any bearing on whether
someone who has been through all the hocus-pocus fundamental type
religions use to get and &quot;keep em' coming back&quot;.  It seems to me that
people who have not been exposed to religions indoctrinations before may
be more inclined to accept the &quot;spirituality&quot; of AA, and vice versa.
Have you run across any stats on that subject?

<p>
ps. CAN YOU ENABLE ME TO GET INTO YOUR FORUM?  User name &quot; georgeb50 &quot;

<p>
Thanks again for all your work!

<p>
pps. My son spent 19 years on crack, had a child, married the mother,
moved to Oregon, and been straight ever since. His experiences with
&quot;treatment centers etc.&quot; are why, in part, I was skeptical of AA to
begin with.

Hello George,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
I trust that you are doing well, and I'm happy to hear that
your son is better too.
<p>
I don't have any statistics on people with religious backgrounds entering A.A., and
what the results were. That brings up some very interesting questions though.
It would be nice to see a study like that.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
First off, we would have to distinguish between the kinds of religious believers.
Some people have very sophisticated ideas of theology, and some simple-minded people
believe that God is Santa Claus and you can get whatever you want just by praying for
it.
Obviously, those two groups will have different reactions to the distorted theology
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<li>
Then there is the question of just how well-informed the believers are. I find that the
majority of the believers in A.A. have little or no real knowledge of the theology
of Christianity, or any other religion, either.
They &quot;just believe&quot;.
When they encounter the strange heretical theology of A.A., they
uncritically accept the stuff because they don't know any better.

<p>
The file
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>
describes many of those conflicts and contradictions.

</ol>
<p>
I will find your registration and approve it. Thanks for letting me know.
I get so many thousands of the spammers' fake registrations that it's easy to
overlook a real human in the mess.
<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Justin P.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Good work<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I have been reading your site over the course of the last week with a great deal of
interest.  I have been an alcoholic since my mid-teens (I'm 29 now) and have been
seeking recovery for the last five years.  For three and a half years of that time I
was in and around AA attending over 500 meetings, having two sponsors (one of
which started drinking again despite devoting his life to AA) and even spending
&pound;20,000 ($35,000) on 12 step based rehab.  During this period I managed 18 months of
continuous sobriety.  However, this was due to my own efforts and not AA and I
started drinking again because nothing I had done actually resolved the underlying
problem of intense cravings which got worse not better as time went on.

<p>
I am not naturally a good cult member as I am an agnostic and an individualist but
there have been points over the last five years that I have been so emotionally
vulnerable that I have actually started to believe this rubbish.  The only facet of
AA that I have found useful is the therapeutic value of discussing my drinking with
others in the same situation.  However, I have never been allowed to &quot;take what I
like and leave the rest&quot; as there are always a few evangelical nutters who try and
force AA dogma on other, more rational members.  As a result, I have taken the view
that AA has no part to play in my recovery moving forward.

<p>
When I started drinking again about 18 months ago the assertion that AA was the only
solution to my problem had been hammered home to such a large extent that I really
believed it.  Knowing that it was never going to work for me and believing
that there was no alternative I simply did nothing about my addictions and watched
my life fall to pieces once again.  Fortunately I have now discovered that there are
numerous other treatment options available.

<p>
I am now nearly three months into a treatment plan which consists of medication
(high dose Baclofen) to eliminate the cravings and regular support through non 12
step groups and forums such as
<a href="mywayout.org" target="_blank">mywayout.org</a>
together with certain beneficial
lifestyle changes.  Not only am I not drinking, I'm not constantly craving it
either.  There is a growing online movement of people utilizing these methods with a
great deal of success .  I strongly believe that the future of addiction treatment
lies with appropriate medication accompanied with a support element tailored to the
individual.

<p>
I will end with this:  Whenever I have returned to AA after a relapse I have been
told that &quot;the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again
and expecting a different result&quot;.  I have a friend who has been going to AA for 18
years and has never managed to stay sober for more than a few months at a time yet
he keeps going to AA!  Talk about insanity!

<p>
Once again thanks for your hard work it has been both enlightening and entertaining
and you have given me a huge amount of ammunition for the next time I get into an
argument with one of these cretins.

<p>
Regards<br>
J P.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello J.P.,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments, and congratulations on your sobriety.
And also your sanity.
<p>
Yes, isn't it funny how people can go to A.A. and relapse for 18 years and never see
the obvious parallel to the A.A. slogan about
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Coincidentally, my doctor has me on Baclofen too, but low dosage. I take it to minimize
muscle tremors. When I quit drinking, I had a problem with sudden muscle contractions,
twitches, jerks, and what I called &quot;micro-seizures&quot;.
I attributed it to residual nerve damage from alcohol.
<p>
Later on, I heard about Baclofen being used in the treatment of alcoholism.  Well, whatever
works.
<p>
About the &quot;beneficial lifestyle changes&quot;, all that I can say is, &quot;Yes, yes, YES!&quot;
I also quit smoking, which was about the smartest thing that I could have done,
because part of the reason for drinking was to kill the pain of tobacco slowly
killing me.
<p>
And then I worked on eating better. Even just a little better. I never did a total
revolution in my diet, but I definitely changed my diet from coffee and cigarettes to
actual food, even fruits and vegetables and salads now and then.
(Actually, maybe that is a total revolution, isn't it?)
And now I consume vitamins like a fiend.

<p>
If you want some other opinions and suggestions from people who got sober, there
are lists of lists here:

<p>
I have lived through life's ups and downs these past few years without a thought
about alcohol, and much less- &quot;needing&quot; a meeting, or that group coercion those
cultists call &quot;fellowship&quot;. LOL, NO thanks!

<p>
I have this site bookmarked just to check in from time to time. I am surprised that
the AA cult is still puttering along after the whole scam has been busted here,
there, and everywhere. I am glad you are still going strong and I am sure your site
has done more good for drinkers than AA and it's 12 steps (to hell) has ever done
for anyone.

<p>
I can honestly say that when I did go to meetings I never got anything out of them
except the urge to kick some teeth out on the scum who prey on the gullible and the
weak. I can also say that when I did go I never swallowed any of their garbage and
made sure to tell anyone who wanted to listen about the Small Book, SOS, SMART, and
when I found this site I guided them here.

<p>
It must get tiring listening to the endless excuses and nonsense the cultist throw
your way but you have done tremendous good with this site and what you have done. I
am glad people like you exist.

<p>
Well, back to life. A full life at that, filled with the joy of living and trying my
best to be a benefit to myself, my children, and to the world.

<p>
I do feel sorry for the poor bastards who drank the AA Kool-Aid but I have no
sympathy or kind thoughts about the scum at the top in AA who are nothing but
sociopathic predators on those who are on the lower levels of their demented
pyramid.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jim,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations on your sobriety.
And of course I couldn't agree more.
<p>
You last note especially rang a bell: I also have special contempt for the people
at the top who knowingly foist quackery on sick people. The &quot;little people&quot; at
the bottom of the A.A. pyramid are just sick and confused and
uninformed, and often mentally ill too,
but the people at the top have college degrees, even Ph.D.s, and they know what they
are doing when
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank">they fake the medical tests and manufacture false statistics</a>.
Those creeps should be put in prison (for fraud with government funds, for starters,
and then for deliberate medical malpractice).

Hello again, Jackie,
<p>
It's a shame that you are so paranoid that you won't read a letter.
I always answer letters with web pages. The same text that gets posted to my web site
is also sent as the reply. That saves me from having to type two different answers.
Also, the links won't work if I don't write in HTML.

<p>
Me, I run Linux so that I don't have to worry about all of those Windoze viruses and
Trojan Horses and worms. And that means that I cannot accidentally spread one, either.
<p>
And I would never send one out deliberately. Don't you think that the Steppers would
turn me in to the FBI in a flat minute if I ever did that?
Do you imagine that I would really be so stupid as to commit suicide that way?

There are lots of people in AA who don't understand what it's truly about,
and some of them will mislead you or let you down. I know because it
happened to me and I felt like I'd been fed a big lie. I kind of dropped
out for a few years (but not completely).

<p>
<font color="blue">
I understand what A.A. is about. It's a cult religion.
You are trying to use
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">the &quot;just a few bad apples&quot; argument
to minimize and deny</a>
the bad aspects of A.A.
</font>
<p>
But I don't want to drink and I don't want to be alone, and I'm happier in
AA than out of it. The people in the program are human and they make
mistakes and hurt people, just like people everywhere.  I had to forgive
the ones who hurt me &#8212; it took years &#8212; and focus more on what I could
conrtribute to AA than on what I could get from it.

<p>
I'm happier today than I've ever been in my life, and it's primarily
because of my involvement in AA and my willingness to give more than I
receive.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, the fact that you are happy in a cult doesn't make it a good cult.
Tom Cruise says that he is really happy in Scientology, too.
</font>
<p>
I hope you find something that works for you and enablles you to be happy
and enjoy life &#8212; you deserve it as  much as any other human being on this

<p>
<font color="blue">
What that means is that you hope that I will eventually conform and come to agree with
you and join your cult. Not gonna happen.
<p>
By the way, I have 11 years clean and sober now, and I'm quite happy.
So I &quot;found something that works&quot; long ago.
<p>
And guess what works?

The Family of 5, plus 1
</center>
We got a pleasant surprise this day. The &quot;Family of 5&quot; showed up with a new little gosling.
It was a very late arrival,
<a href="orange-letters301.html#goslings2" target="_blank">two weeks late</a>.

Obviously, the mother had a slow egg remaining in the nest.
She would take her hatched babies out foraging for food during the day, and then
return to the nest at night and sit on that last remaining egg,
and finally, it got enough &quot;warm time&quot; to finish its development and hatch.
The new gosling is the littlest one in the center of the picture.<br>
By the way, that is one lucky egg. Two weeks of sitting unguarded during the day, and nothing
found it and ate it. Now that is luck.

Subject:  	RE: What's Not Good About A.A.<br>

<p>
The below is just my $0.02. I'd prefer if you kept this correspondance between us,
but ultimately it is up to you what you decide to do with it.
 If any of the below
came off as representation of any organization, cause, or person other than myself,
was not intended and was by mistake. Any typos, grammatical errors, etc.. well, you
get the point. This is just my opinion and nothing more. If you would like to
respond, you are more than welcome to. I will most definitely read your response,
but will probably not be replying.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anonymous,
<p>
I will publish this question, and I will answer it, because it is an important question.
But I will keep you anonymous, so you need not worry about confidentiality.
</font>
<p>
Please do not take it as anything other than &quot;I
just don't have a heck of a lot of time&quot;. In fact, I'm already late for something,
so here we go...
<p>
 &quot;1. It doesn't work.&quot;
<p>
False. I won't get into very much detail, but
your statement is wrong. A.A. worked for me (I'm sure you've heard that more times
than you can count), and you even go on to say &quot;...A.A. kills one patient for
each one that it saves...&quot;. How can it not work, yet &quot;save&quot; people at the same time?
And you really think A.A., as an organization, ACTUALLY kills people? It strikes me
a bit funny that society doesn't accept &quot;I am an alcoholic&quot; as an excuse for
anything, yet you'll blame A.A. for alcoholism related deaths, not alcoholism
itself, despite alcoholism being a self-injurious disease.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Right.
The first confusion is in just what constitutes &quot;help&quot; or &quot;saving&quot;. Alcoholics Anonymous is good at
claiming undue credit. There are plenty of people who are going to quit drinking, because they have just had
it with being so sick all of the time, and having alcohol mess up their lives.
Those are the cases of normal spontaneous remission.
Whenever one of those people walks into an A.A. meeting, A.A. is quick to
claim that it saved them, or &quot;helped&quot; them. And A.A. wants to count them as its success rate.
But A.A. is not due the credit for those people, even
though they may have attended A.A. meetings while they quit drinking. I suppose I should modify
that sentence to read, &quot;A.A. kills one patient for
each one that it appears to save.&quot;
<p>
Killing as many patients as it appears to help means that A.A. does not work. Look at penicillin,
for example. It is deadly poisonous to some patients, and kills them. But doctors are careful about whom
they give penicillin to, and I
think it's fair to say that penicillin saves at least 1000 or 10,000 patients for every one that it kills.
Now that is a medicine that works.
Something that kills as many patients as it appears to help is useless, or even worse than useless.
It's really a very poisonous medicine.
<p>
Now your question about &quot;how could A.A. really kill people?&quot; Simple:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Have crazy sponsors who tell the newcomers
not to take their doctor-prescribed medications. The newcomers then die from heart attacks, strokes, psychotic
breaks and suicides, and on and on.
<p><li>
Also drive newcomers into bad depression by the constant harping on lists of sins and moral shortcomings, and
constant confession sessions, which also drives people to suicide.
<p><li>
Then there is the teaching that alcoholics are powerless over alcohol.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">That leads to worse binge drinking</a>,
and deaths.
<p><li>
Then there is the induced hopelessness, which leads people to believe that they cannot ever recover.
That leads to more suicides and uncontrolled drinking.
<p>
Bill Wilson even taught A.A. recruiters to make people feel hopeless in order to mess with their minds:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Maybe you have disturbed him about the question of
alcoholism. This is all to the good. The more hopeless he feels,
the better. He will be more likely to follow your suggestions.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 94.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is vicious.

<p><li>
And then there is the general obnoxiousness of Alcoholics Anonymous driving people away from
any kind of treatment or help. Lots of people decide that they would rather drink themselves to death
than turn into an A.A. religious nutcase.

</ol>

</font>

<p>
About alcoholism as a disease: definition of disease that can be applied here: 1.  a disordered or
incorrectly functioning organ, part, structure, or system of the body resulting from
the effect of genetic or developmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional
deficiency or imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors; illness;
sickness; ailment. Now, based on that definition, and the recognitions and
descriptions of &quot;Alcohol Disorders&quot; defined by the DSM IV-TR, &quot;Alcohol Disorders&quot;
(more specifically, the subcategories), by definition, are diseases. Alcohol
dependence is a classification of &quot;Alcohol Disorders&quot;, according to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-Text Revision (DSM IV-TR),
specifically Alcohol Dependence &#8212; Diagnostic Code 303.90. An interesting note?
Alcohol Abuse is Diagnostic Code 305.00, falling also under &quot;Alcohol Disorders&quot;. DC
303.90 is the more severe of the two, yet both are loosely thrown around and defined
as &quot;alcoholism&quot;. I am also looking forward to the DSM V to skew recovery numbers for
ANY method even more. See:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222642/http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/14/dsm-5-could-mean-40-of-college-students-are-alcoholics/?iid=hl-main-mostpop1" target="_blank">
http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/14/dsm-5-could-mean-40-of-college-students-are-alcoholics/?iid=hl-main-mostpop1</a>.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but no. The American Psychiatric Association very deliberately
<i><b>did not</b></i> &quot;loosely throw around&quot; the term &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
and they refused to even put that word in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders. It isn't in there, not anywhere. I've looked very carefully, and it
is not in there.
<p>
&quot;Alcohol Abuse&quot; means &quot;alcohol abuse&quot;, not &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
and &quot;Alcohol Dependence&quot; means addiction to alcohol, not &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
&quot;Alcoholism&quot; is not a &quot;disease&quot;. Period. It is behavior. Drinking is behavior.
So is eating too much fatty or sugary food and getting fat. So is smoking cigarettes.
So is snorting cocaine. And shooting heroin.
And on and on. Just because someone is engaging in very bad unhealthy behavior does not mean
that he has a disease. (And it also does not mean that he is powerless.)
<p>
Your very loose first dictionary definition of &quot;disease&quot; is
worthless. By that definition, children eating too much ice cream and
candy produces the nasty &quot;spiritual disease&quot; called
&quot;candyism&quot; when they get a belly-ache.

</font>
<p>

And that is another issue I'd like to address. There are so many possible factors
that affect efficacy of any treatment program. I have no idea how ANY recovery
program (including A.A.) can keep a straight face when they talk about successful
recovery rates. Most information about recovery rates is pretty much a boyscouts
honor (other than the medically verified, and even that is limited).

<p>
<font color="blue">
The whole point of a
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled study</a>
is to have two large groups of
identical or evenly matched patients, and only one group gets the real treatment. The other group gets nothing,
or maybe a placebo. That cancels out all of those other confusing factors, like motivation, or
mindset, or additional
illnesses. Both groups will be equally motivated, and equally sick. The only difference between the
two groups is the treatment being tested.
<p>
So, you give the medicine or treatment to one group, and not the other, and then wait a while and see
what the results are. You compare the results from the two groups to see what effect the medicine or
treatment produced.
<p>
That is how modern doctors test medicines and treatments. And such valid testing has revolutionized
medicine by separating the good from the garbage.
<p>
Well,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">the testing of A.A.</a> has put it in the garbage category.

<p>
By the way, when you are doing such a test, you don't just trust the patients when they say that
they haven't been drinking or drugging.
You observe, and you test.
<a href="orange-letters247.html#IJMA" target="_blank"> In other tests, they found</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Self-reporting. The studies that claim that A.A. works great based their conclusions on a bunch of
alcoholics just declaring that they have not been drinking lately. But when such alcoholics were
tested by urinalysis, 20% of them were lying. That is to be expected. Nobody wants to go to A.A. meetings
and confess that he is drinking again, and that the 12 Steps aren't working for him, and he isn't
&quot;spiritual&quot;.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition, if a &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot; cuts down on his drinking and cleans up his act and appears so
sober that he is able to fool the doctors, how bad can his drinking really be?
Isn't it just possible that an &quot;alcoholic&quot; who improves his lifestyle and his health to
the point that he can routinely pass for sober might really be &quot;recovered&quot;?

</font>
<p>
Allegedly, a member of A.A. must send word to the General Service Office in her/his area in
notification of a yearly mark of sobriety. In the groups I have been around, this
RARELY happens. In fact, nobody really even knows that is what is supposed to
happen. IDEALLY, you could get more reliable numbers from that, but that just isn't
going to happen.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is interesting, but I never heard of that happening either. I've never seen or even heard
of a document from the GSO reporting the totals of such sent-in sobriety claims.
</font>
<p>
From your website:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health, performed the 2001-2002
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. For it, they
interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol dependence found
in the DSM-IV, they found:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;About
75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do so without seeking
any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab) programs and AA. Only 13
percent of people with alcohol dependence ever receive specialty alcohol
treatment.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above used the DSM-IV. As mentioned just previously, the DSM-IV-TR
now has Alcohol Disorders, with two different Diagnostic Codes. Understandably, the
above statistic probably combines both diagnostic codes 303.90 and 305.00, or
whatver the DC was in DSM-IV. I would be interested to see what the statistics were
for ONLY DC 303.90 from the DSM-IV-TR. Unfortunately, we'll probably never see
anything like that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
True.
</font>

<p>
If it &quot;saves&quot; even one life, as you put it, that is fantastic
news to me. Alcoholics need any help they can get. If something else works for an
alcoholic, I am extremely happy as well. We can't forget who the enemy is here.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, killing as many people as it appears to save is a disaster, not a wonderfully good thing.
<p>
I know who and what the enemy is. Did you read about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>?
</font>
<p>
When
you truly understand what that dark hole feels like, seeing anybody come from that
bad place, no matter the method, is a true miracle.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Been there, done that. I do truly understand. Now you are trying to use
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">the propaganda trick</a>
 of claiming that your opponent does not know what he is talking about, because he
hasn't had the &quot;special experiences&quot; that you have. Wrong. I've been to
hell and back with alcohol too, and I do know.
</font>
<p>
  
Again, just my $0.02. I'd prefer
if you kept this correspondance between us, but ultimately it is up to you what you
decide to do with it. If any of the above came off as representation of any
organization, cause, or person other than myself, it was by mistake. This is just my
opinion and nothing more. Take care of yourself.
