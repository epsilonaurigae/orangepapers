Subject:  	Re: I don't know what AA u went to go observe. But next time you should go in without a blind fold and ear plugs!!! AA is for alcoholics not for people that merely drink.<br>

<p>
You know it doesn't matter how much we banter back and forth About success rates For
me and only me Alcoholics Anonymous worked 100 percent And regardless of what your
success rate is As long as it helps one person either one of us Then the world has
changed So good luck to you I hope everybody that comes to you gets sober. And I
will do my best as well

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Randaron,
<p>
Actually, one person does not establish a rate, because a rate is something per something else,
like miles per gallon, or success stories per 100 A.A. newcomers. So you can't declare that
A.A. has a 100% success rate for you.
Also, you have no idea what really caused you to quit drinking.
 There is zero evidence to support the idea that A.A.
somehow caused you to quit drinking.


<p>
And what caused you to decide to quit drinking and
 go to A.A. in the first place? That was the real cause of your sobriety.

<p>
The A.A. rationalization about &quot;if it helps one person&quot; is just a just another
standard propaganda trick and dodge. The truth is that A.A. kills more people than it helps.
That is no great accomplishment.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who went on to become an enthusiastic Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous,
established that A.A. has nearly a 6-to-1 death-to-success ratio.
<p>
And Dr. Vaillant plainly said that the few people who quit drinking in A.A. were the ones who were going
to quit drinking anyway. He said that A.A. did not improve the sobriety situation at all.
A.A. produced a zero percent improvement over no treatment or help or &quot;group support&quot;.
But, because Dr. Vaillant just loves the A.A. cult religion, he said that everybody should get shoved into
A.A. anyway, so that they can &quot;confess their sins to a high-status healer&quot;. Yes, he is nuts.
And that is the A.A. leadership talking.

<p>
We were just discussing the harm that A.A. does, in a previous letter, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters353.html#Andre_D" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters353.html#Andre_D</a><br>
so I will point you to that.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Mr Orange,

<p>
I am real not a spammer. I would like to join the forum.

<p>
Also, i just wanted to ask if you knew much about a chap called Rick Ross?<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://www.rickross.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rickross.com/</a><br>
that is his website.

<p>
I sent an email to him the other day as he isn't willing to acknowledge AA or the
splinter groups such as Primary Purpose, Road to Recovery &amp; Pacific Group being
cultish. I read a few posts of his to members asking genuine questions. The few that
i saw were not abusive or derogatory in anyway &#8212; they questioned wanting to know
more. Below is the email i sent to him:

Hello Rick,
<p>
I was kindly put in touch with your website today by a friend. I've been searching
it briefly about Alcoholics Anonymous. Can i ask is there any recent more
un-biased discussions about it? As the comments i have stumbled on seem to
discredit people saying AA is a cult. Even though Dr Bob &amp; Bill W were the
founders (now dead like many other leaders). I noticed the moderator kept stopping
people from expressing their concerns and valid questioning of how AA is run. I
was in AA for over 6 years. I left a year and a half ago. And thankfully i found a
therapist who has helped me recover from the trauma.
<p>
There is a stricter offshoot group called &quot;Road to Recovery&quot; which was created by
men in the Westcoast of California &#8212; &quot;The Pacific Group&quot;. They are also heavily
linked to groups in Plymouth, Bristol, South East London and so on. And in New
York &quot;Atlantic Group, Washington DC Group and &quot;Prime Purpose&quot; back in California.
<p>
I have experienced the Road to Recovery group first hand for over an 18 month
period. Hardcore brainwashing took place in these meetings. There was a clear
distinct hierarchy and strict rules to adhere to. I suffered (and still suffer)
from the control in these meetings. The usual AA meetings (if you want to call
them that) are also abusive. People worship Bill W and Bill W worshipped himself &#8212; 
hence his name breaking the 'anonymity' rule. He was an ego who 13 stepped many
women.
<p>
I look forward to your response.
<p>
Kind regards,<br>

<p>
Hello again, Emma,
<p>
Okay, now I have enough time to finish the answer.
<p>
You are quite right that Rick Ross dissed you and would not listen to your story.
He has made up his mind and facts be damned. In his mind, your experiences are irrelevant because
he is brilliant and you aren't.

<p>
What is really appalling is his definition of &quot;cult&quot;.
It comes from his history as an &quot;exit counselor&quot;.
He used to be in the business of kidnapping children from cults and holding them prisoner and
torturing them until they said what the paying parents wanted to hear.
<p>
That is of course feloniously illegal.
When &quot;exit counselors&quot; started getting busted and doing
hard time in prison for kidnapping, and getting sued for millions of
dollars for false imprisonment and torture,
Rick Ross got out of the &quot;exit counselor&quot; business.
Then he went into the &quot;cult expert&quot; business and testified in a lot of court cases as
an expert on cults.

<p>
So Rick Ross's definition of cult is, &quot;If there are paying parents complaining, then it's a cult.
Otherwise, it isn't a cult.&quot;
Rick Ross actually said that in a letter:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
-----Original Message-----<br>
Sent: 02 October 2006 12:19<br>
<p>
I recognize the effort of some people to call AA a &quot;cult&quot; and organize
anti-AA sites on the Internet.
<p>
However, I have received no significant complaints from families over
the years (since 1983) about AA.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Complaints from families determine whether a group is a cult?

<p>
Now Rick Ross has a web site where he has collected a lot of newspaper stories and letters about
cults, and he calls himself an expert on cults, and bases his &quot;expertise&quot; on years of
experience in torturing children.

<p>
What is Rick Ross's training and education about cults? None.<br>
Degrees in sociology or psychology? None.<br>
Years of membership in a cult? None.<br>
He has no basis for claiming to be an expert on cults.
He just says that he is an expert. He seems to be a legend in his own mind.

<p>
In fact, his history is so bad that
Wikipedia has the story of Ross going to Waco, Texas,
and giving unsolicited advice to the FBI on how to deal with David Koresh during
the famous standoff in 1993.  Ross told the FBI to be confrontational and
challenge Koresh. When the FBI did that, and tried to break into Koresh's compound,
Koresh flipped out and killed himself and his whole cult in 
a mass suicide, including killing all of the children.
Ross disavows any responsibility for the result.
<p>
See:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_%28consultant%29" target="_blank">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_%28consultant%29</a>

<p>
<img align="right" src="http://orange-papers.info/flameaward2.gif" border="10" bordercolor="clear" width="157" height="101">
So I don't expect that Rick Ross will listen to you or anyone else about Alcoholics Anonymous.
He has made up his mind, and just censors and blocks and bans people who say things that he
doesn't want to hear. Of course he banned me, and also childishly awarded me
&quot;Two Flames&quot; for being a critic of Rick Ross.
(Wouldn't it be neat if this post got me three flames? How about four? What do I have to do
to get four flames from Rick Ross?)

<p>
Oh well, I'll be happy to have you in my forum, and I won't censor you or delete your posts,
even if I disagree with you about something. Welcome.

<p>
By the way,
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html#Ross" target="_blank">Rick Ross finally admitted</a>
that
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html" target="_blank">the Midtown Group in Washington DC</a>
was a cult
after The Washington Post, Newsweek magazine, and NBC TV news revealed what was going on
there. But Ross did not see &#8212; or refused to notice &#8212; that Mike Quinones, the leader of
the Midtown cult, was the grand-sponsee of Clancy Imusland, and that the Midtown Group was
only a tiny part of Clancy's sprawling empire.  Clancy has groups all across America, with
a variety of names. In Los Angeles, it's
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">the Pacific Group</a>.
 In San Francisco, it's 
<a href="orange-letters251.html#So_Done_With_AA" target="_blank">The Nursery</a>.
In New York, it's
<a href="orange-letters243.html#Miss_A_Nonymous" target="_blank">the Atlantic Group</a>
(also look <a href="orange-letters244.html#Miss_A_Nonymous" target="_blank">here</a>
and <a href="orange-letters261.html#Adrian_B" target="_blank">here</a>).  
In the Midwest, it's
<a href="orange-letters219.html#Foxhall" target="_blank">the Foxhall Group</a>
(<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">spreadsheet with failure rate here</a>),
and the &quot;Lemont Oaks&quot; group, &quot;Oak Lawn Big Book&quot;,
the &quot;Between the Covers&quot;, &quot;It's in the Book&quot; groups, and the Badger Group.  
They even have missionary outposts in
<a href="orange-letters237.html#Clancy" target="_blank">Plymouth, England, and London</a>.
<p>
And as you mentioned in your letter to Ross, they also have the &quot;Road To Recovery&quot; group in
Great Britain, and the &quot;Prime Purpose&quot; group in California.
<p>
Then even
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="_blank">Young Peoples' AA</a> has degenerated into
a sexual exploitation society.
<p>
But Rick Ross didn't notice any of that. He tries to declare that things like the
Midtown Group and other crazy extremists are merely isolated groups that have
no connection to the parent organization.
<p>
Rick Ross's behavior there is so improper and stubborn and unrealistic that I wonder if he is secretly
a member of A.A., who is trying to defend A.A. from the truth.
Or maybe he just can't stand to be wrong about anything.
<p>
(Okay Rick, does that get me Four Flames?)
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Mr Orange,

<p>
I signed up as sunsetanon

<p>
hope you can find it.

<p>
Many thanks for responding i really appreciate it.

<p>
When i received Rick's response it genuinely upset me. I told him i had had a break
down and yet he wasn't kind, supportive or respectful. If i had said i was sexually
harrassed (which i have been ample times and preyed on physically too) would he have
dismissed me as a &quot;hysterical woman&quot;? I think he's insulting thousands of people's
experience. I read the link you sent and boy is his arrogance disgusting.

<p>
He says he has no affiliation with AA &#8212; so then why does he refuse to even
investigate? I know three stronghold cults within AA.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. Road to Recovery (UK hub for Clancy)<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://www.roadtorecoverygroup.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35" target="_blank">
http://www.roadtorecoverygroup.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35</a><br>

As you can see it says on the banner &quot;road to recovery &#8212; group of Alcoholics
Anonymous&quot;. Now if that isn't an admission of splintering what is??
<li>
2. Pacific Group (Clancy) (I have met Clancy &amp; experienced his weird cult follows
personally &#8212; i will tell you about it in another email &#8212; i really need to).
<li>
3. Primary Purpose &#8212; 
</ul>

<p>
What i find the most upsetting of Rick is his belligerent refusal to research and
investigate. He seemed to have started his career with good intentions... but then
something changed along the way and now he has become the very thing he hates.

<p>

Hello Rick,

<p>
Perhaps i am an old fashioned sort of women. It's just that when i receive emails  &#8212; 
of a distressing nature &#8212; i tend to reassure the person that what they say is taken
seriously and in confidence. I will always show i am listening &#8212; perhaps addressing
the points mentioned using real data to back up my reasons and always sign off
accordingly.

<p>
In that respect that is why i didn't think your email was particularly pleasant.

<p>
The fact is there are many NEW splinter groups that have been causing the UK major
problems. Yorks Head Office has assimilated a set of questions and procedures for
certain groups to adhere to. They retaliated by ignoring the request from Head
office. The web link below is from the group i attended for 18 months. They even
admit that they are a group of Alcoholics Anonymous. They do not have approved
literature and advise their flock not to take medication. And that if they do take
medication they are dropped from the group and sponsor. Some people have committed
suicide because they have stopped taking serious meds. I don't know how many more
accounts i need to send to you. I will if you want me to.

<p>
[www.roadtorecoverygroup.org.uk]

<p>
Clancy brought over his version of AA a long time ago from LA to the UK &#8212; in LA
it's known as the Pacific Group &#8212; in the UK it's known as Road to Recovery.

<p>
They have a hierarchy of sponsors. You are only allowed a sponsor from these groups
if you have a sponsor from non-road-to-recovery meetings then you are not taken
seriously. I had a sponsor (the one i talked about) who was not part of this group
and they only half involved me in the meetings. I had to arrive an hour before the
meeting started to set up and open up &#8212; and stay an hour after the meeting. The
meeting was an hour &amp; a half long. If you were a full RTR member then you had to do
that 3 times a week. Call your sponsor at 7am every morning. Complete the tasks on
the card. If for any reason you were feeling bad then the sponsor would say, &quot;have
you done everything on the suggestions card?&quot; if the answer was no the sponsor would
then say, &quot;call me when you have&quot; and then hang up. They had to have two home groups
and another meeting of their choice. The two home groups must have their sponsor in
it. So, three nights a week from 5:30pm-10pm they had to attend these meetings. They
(along with other people) were told not to speak until they had completed step 5
(the confessional step). And then once they had they could confess what they had
done wrong in their life and now how good it was. Some people said the exact same
thing week in week out. I was nearly able to recite what he said.

<p>
One of my friends (no longer friends) had to pick his kids up after school. He was
told by his sponsor he wasn't allowed to do that &#8212; that AA came first above
everything. He was told that afternoon. He had to leave them at school unattended
for 2 hours.

<p>
There are only a handful of these groups in London but they are growing.

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1. West London &#8212; 5 meetings i know of.
<li> 2. South East London &#8212; 2 i know of.
<li> 3. Plymouth &#8212; most of the town (the local rehabs have tried to ban the members from poaching clients)
<li> 4. Bristol
<li> 5. Glasgow
</ul>

<p>
Like i said the Head Office have investigated but as per usual they are not willing
to do anything about it.

<p>
[www.aacultwatch.co.uk]

<p>
These guys are AA people who have acknowledged these splinter groups. You should (if
you are willing to) talk to them about it. They have a massive hub of information
and collated from Head Office too.

<p>
Families are being broken up, friendships dissolved, alienation and isolation occur
regularly. The constant fear that if you do not do what they do you will drink again
which in turn means you will die. That there is only one way to sobriety and that is
AA. I have been treated with post traumatic stress because of the constant
belittling, dismissive statements, ignoring, freezing out, mocking, constant
judgements, slanderous opinions, 4 hours of ripping me down (which when it ended i
wanted to go home and kill myself as i thought i was doing &quot;this thing&quot; incorrectly
and i was a piece of sh**). I was constantly told that recovery is a lonely path. I
didn't trust anyone in the end. Whenever i talked to people they were ready to offer
up useless 'therapeutic' advice when they hadn't even experienced what i had been
through. It would be a throw away statement like &#8212; have you prayed today? Have you
turned over your will to god?

<p>
The thing is the splinter groups and AA too are cult-like in their approach to
people. I have 6+ years of experience of meetings in London. We have over 800
meetings a week in our capital. At the height of my attendance i did 6 meetings a
week. I was encouraged to co for coffee with other recovering people after the
meeting. To make friends in meetings only (coerced). I constantly heard people refer
to non-alcoholics as &quot;normies&quot;. A new type of language had to be learnt and
understood. 12 stepping? I had no idea what on earth that meant. I found out from my
sponsor about 13 stepping... it was old timers (or even newbies) preying on
vulnerable women. I was preyed on in the LA meetings on my first trip to LA. A guy
saw me as a rabbit in the head lights. I was young and naive. He took me to a
gallery and bombarded me with sexual innuendos, smothered my senses with jokes of
sex, what he liked sexually for over 3 odd hours. I went to bed with this guy. I had
no idea what happened. The next day he dumped me at a bus stop. I had a massive
breakdown. And i heard this was a regular activity in meetings in Los Angeles. The
meetings in Beverley Hills are just as messed up.

<p>
To suggest that the only splinter groups are Synnanon and Endeavour is a dangerous
path to go down. I'm not the type of person to make slanderous statements about
people, groups or activities. I have experience and stories that will shine light on
AA. It may not have been created to be a cult &#8212; however, over time people have done
whatever they can to manipulate people. Another old friend lived with a fellow
recovering alcoholic. The flatmate relapsed and my then friend kicked him out and
stopped being his mate?! He justified it by saying he didn't want people like that
(non-believers) affecting him and possibly making him drink again.

<p>
Anyway, those are but a few of my stories.

And judges still sentence people to go to A.A. meetings?

Well, Rick Ross may ignore and delete your letters, but I'm not going to.
And since this web site is getting

Subject:  	Rick Ross vs. Steve Hassan<br>

<p>
Recently, while doing some research on the Scientology cult, I ran across what
appears to be a feud between Rick Ross and Steve Hassan.  Or perhaps it's more
accurate to say that Rick is publishing some seriously nasty stuff about Steve,
complaining about his ethics and fees.  I don't think Steve is responding in kind.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://www.rickross.com/reference/general/general1529.html" target="_blank">
http://www.rickross.com/reference/general/general1529.html</a>

<p>
It seems to me that a guy with no professional credentials, no education past high
school, a history of both criminal and civil legal troubles and who charges pretty
steep fees for his own work is on fairly shaky ethical ground himself, and really
shouldn't be going around pointing fingers at others.  But I don't know the
backstory.  Do you know what's behind Ross's mudslinging?

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello Mona,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. Wow, when it rains, it pours.
<a href="orange-letters354.html#Emma_C" target="_blank">The previous bunch of letters</a>
also complained about Rick Ross.
<p>
I find Rick Ross's denunciation of Steve Hassan to be totally hypocritical.
Rick Ross used to make a living by kidnapping children from cults and holding them prisoner
and torturing and &quot;reverse brainwashing&quot; them to get them to
say what the paying parents wanted to hear.
Ross called it &quot;exit counseling&quot;.
And I never saw Rick Ross print up a schedule of what he charged the parents for
committing such crimes.
I know that it was a profitable business.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_%28consultant%29" target="_blank">Wikipedia
mentions a typical price of $5000 per kidnapping</a> (in 1980s dollars).

<p>
While I personally find Steve Hassan's prices to be high, that's his business and he has
a right to set his prices as he chooses. He is making a living at it; I'm not.

<p>
The thing that I like about Steve Hassan is that he has some good sound advice about how
to get loved ones out of cults.
(<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank">See his books, here</a>.)
He understands what it is like to be in a cult because he was in the Moonies, and was
personally used and abused by Rev. Sun Myung Moon, for several years.  Rick Ross has zero
experience there.

<p>
Steve Hassan does not recommend coercive &quot;exit counseling&quot; like Ross has done.
Hassan recognizes that such abuse can cause more harm than good.
The truth of the matter is, most people eventually drop out of cults without any kidnapping
and imprisonment and &quot;counseling&quot; to &quot;help&quot; them.

<p>
I suspect that Rick Ross is behaving the way that he does precisely because he is incompetent
and has nothing to sell.  As you mentioned, he has zero credentials or training.
And zero experience in a cult.
He is just a self-declared &quot;expert&quot;, without education, training, or experience.
He seems to be very jealous of anyone who presents any competition.
(There are more examples of that
<a href="orange-rross_aa01.html" target="_blank">in the letters here</a>.)
He is very quick to denounce others as knowing nothing while promoting himself as an expert.
And he rationalizes that his critics are all cult members, which is not true at all.
(See
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_%28consultant%29" target="_blank">the Wikipedia page</a>.)

That is an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i> attack</a>,
which is, ironically,
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks" target="_blank">a propaganda technique routinely used by cults</a>.
And it's also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#delegitimize_opponent" target="_blank">Delegitimize One's Opponent</a>,
another common propaganda trick.

<p>
If Rick Ross were really devoted to getting rid of cults, and stopping them from harming young
people, you would think that he would welcome all of the allies and help that he could get.
(I do.)
<p>
In the final analysis, I think that the &quot;anti-cult movement&quot; as promoted by Rick Ross is
just another scam. There are con artists on both sides of the fence.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	Leaving AA, leaving an LGAT<br>

<p>
Richard B here &#8212;

<p>
Thanks again for your spirited anti-cult muckraking. It helps keep me sane.

<p>
A useful term &#8212; Large Group Awareness Training, or LGAT &#8212; has come to my attention
lately.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://www.lgattruth.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lgattruth.com</a>
and Wikipedia have a lot to say on the subject.

<p>
Is AA an LGAT? One positive thing I've found about AA is the solid and down-to-earth
accounts people can give you of their lives &#8212; this quite apart from the negative,
life-hating Buchmanite theology that comes close to poisoning the whole damned
thing. Disclosure: I'm a proud member of the Newcomers Rescue League. I make a
special point of urging them to tear the Big Book to shreds. And questioning the
virgin birth of Bill Wilson. Etc. etc.

<p>
One the other hand, unfortunately, there IS such a thing as a cult that is nothing
but a cult through and through and can't possibly be turned into anything else.

<p>
I bring this up because the wife of a friend of mine has recently gotten involved in
something called the Pathways Institute, with the result that she's up at 4 a.m.
texting possible recruits. Besides being full of shit &#8212; selling people what they
already have &#8212; this operation is also a classic pyramid scheme.

<p>
How many people, I wonder, &quot;graduate&quot; from AA, as she did, to blatantly
money-centered and coercive LGATs? I'm horrified by what I've seen. And there's this
creepy &quot;Godspell look&quot; that members have. I'd like to think there could be a happy
ending to this &#8212; a sudden &quot;what have I been doing&quot; disaffection, followed by a rush
to the exit &#8212; but then there's the thought of the damage that may have to come
first.

<p>
No doubt there's something on your site that's germane to this situation. Could you
point me in its direction?

<p>
Many thanks

Hello again, Richard,
<p>
It's good to hear from you.  Ah yes,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training" target="_blank">the LGAT racket</a>.

The first time I heard of that particular con, it was &quot;Werner Erhard&quot;
(really, Jack Rosenberg) selling it in his &quot;<i>est</i>&quot; scam.
The logic is simple and brilliant: &quot;Why cheat one person at a time out of their
money when you can cheat 300 people at a time?&quot;
It's the application of mass-production techniques to
cult money-making.

<p>
Werner Erhard claimed that he could enlighten whole crowds just as effectively as
a more traditional teacher doing one-on-one work.
But of course what was really going on there was some standard brainwashing techniques,
including heavy use of the
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_cognitive" target="_blank">Cognitive Dissonance Technique</a>.

<p>
People come out of those weekend-long sessions with their minds all spun out, and while
they are still dizzy and euphoric, instructed to sign up for more courses of &quot;awareness
training&quot;, and to also go recruit their friends and relatives and co-workers.
<p>
By the way, it's still going on. When Werner Erhard was about to get busted for all kinds
of crimes, he sold his organization to a subordinate and fled to Europe, where he lives in
comfort off of his stolen millions.

The subordinate continues the racket under the names &quot;The Forum&quot;,
&quot;The Landmark Forum&quot;, &quot;Landmark Educational Forum&quot; and
&quot;Landmark Education&quot;.

<p>
Here are some links to information about &quot;Werner Erhard&quot; and &quot;est&quot;:

<p>
<ol type="A">
<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Werner01" target="_blank"><i>est</i> graduates</a>

</font>
<br>
I think the answer is, &quot;Some, perhaps many.&quot; And it isn't just LGAT rackets.
I hear many stories about A.A. members also getting into goofy things like pyramid marketing
schemes, and &quot;gifting tables&quot;, and hocus-pocus nonsense like
<a href="orange-heresy.html#ACIM" target="_blank"><i>A Course In Miracles</i></a>
and
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#AJRussell_5"><i>God Calling</i></a>.

A few months back, there was a story in the forum about a
&quot;gifting table&quot; racket in A.A. &#8212; sponsors recruiting their sponsees
&#8212; that ended in murder:<br>
<p>
And years ago, I was saddened to see
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Nori_Muster" target="_blank">Nori Muster finally get out of the Hari Krishna cult</a>,
only to declare that
<a href="orange-letters43.html#Nori_Muster" target="_blank">the 12 Steps were a &quot;cure for cults&quot;</a>.
<p>
It seems that once people throw their logical thinking minds into the trash can and believe
that irrational illogical nonsense can really work for them,
they have opened the door to many kinds of insane behavior.

<p>
About Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer:
Yes, I really like her and admire her for her work. I feel sad about how her life
ended.  She got ripped to shreds by attorneys who argued in court that if you cannot
predictably compel someone to commit a crime, then there is no such thing as brainwashing.
And they did their best to totally discredit her life's work.
Well, the lawyers were just nitpicking and taking things to extremes.
Yes, there is such a thing as brainwashing and coercive persuasion, even if you
cannot reliably make <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> out of everybody.

<p>
To end on a bright note, you must see the movie
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005302/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078227/?ref_=sr_1" target="_blank"><i>Semi-Tough</i>, starring Burt Reynolds,
Kris Kristofferson, and Jill Clayburgh</a>.
It is a delicious spoof of Werner Erhard and <i>est</i>.

Now you stated that Alcoholics Anonymous had a success rate of less than zero for
sobriety, and established that A.A. has nearly a 6-to-1 death-to-success ratio. if
success is measured by sales  &quot;how many books have you sold&quot; A.A. 30 million, as
well as many other publications, you ? as for  Dr. George E. Vaillant. he is more
likely to be disgruntled because the corporation called World Services Inc. did not
give him a severance package of 2 or 300 million dollars like most non-profit
trustees such as UNICEF and others with similar agendas...  you know those people
that help all those starving kids from there 8 million $ homes in the Hamptonsand of
course its not about the money with them either...! So what you say is 30 million
&quot;according to the sale of Big books&quot; got sober and 180 million committed suicide or
was that Dr. Vaillant that says that? More than 2 thirds of the US population. wow 6
to 1 huh, by the way A.A. has no leaders just trusted servants you should read the
book at least once. without injecting extremely superior intellect between
sentences. And I had got the numbers from you and the link below

Hello again, Randaron,
<p>
  Actually, one person does not establish a rate, because a rate is
something per something else, like miles per gallon, or success stories per 100 A.A.
newcomers. So you can't declare that A.A. has a 100% success rate for you. Also, you
have no idea what really caused you to quit drinking. There is zero evidence to
support the idea that A.A. somehow caused you to quit drinking.  And what caused you
to decide to quit drinking and go to A.A. in the first place? That was the real
cause of your sobriety.  The A.A. rationalization about &quot;if it helps one person&quot; is
just a just another standard propaganda trick and dodge. The truth is that A.A.
kills more people than it helps. That is no great accomplishment. Dr. George E.
Vaillant, who went on to become an enthusiastic Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous,
established that A.A. has nearly a 6-to-1 death-to-success ratio.  And Dr. Vaillant
plainly said that the few people who quit drinking in A.A. were the ones who were
going to quit drinking anyway. He said that A.A. did not improve the sobriety
situation at all. A.A. produced a zero percent improvement over no treatment or help
or &quot;group support&quot;. But, because Dr. Vaillant just loves the A.A. cult religion, he
said that everybody should get shoved into A.A. anyway, so that they can &quot;confess
their sins to a high-status healer&quot;. Yes, he is nuts. And that is the A.A.
leadership talking.  We were just discussing the harm that A.A. does, in a previous
letter, here:

The famous 12-step program for stopping an addiction has sold more than 30 million

Hello again, Randy,
<p>
Well, starting at the top:

<ol>

<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Success is <b>not</b> measured by book sales. It is measured by what percentage of the patients
 &#8212;  alcoholic newcomers  &#8212;  get and stay sober.
<p>
Don't you notice what is wrong with that number? 30 Million?  But there are fewer than
two million A.A. members in the whole world. But they have sold 30 million books just in the USA?
So what is really happening is that a lot of
people get invited, coerced, cajoled, or seduced into attending some A.A. meetings, where
they are given a <i>Big Book</i>, or buy one. Then they find that it is bullshit and throw it away.
I find old copies of the <i>Big Book</i> in used bookstores and Goodwills all over town. I have about
10 of them myself now, second, third, and fourth editions. And they have absolutely nothing to do with my sobriety.
<p>
What is really sad is reading all of the inscriptions in the used books, people
wishing the former owner well, and yammering about how wonderful the program is,
and it's only up from here.  And then the book ends up in Goodwill.
We can only guess what happened to the former book owner.

<p>
Nice try at an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">ad hominem attack</a>
on Dr. and Prof. George E. Vaillant, but it does not wash.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. Vaillant did his research on alcoholics at the Cambridge-Sommerville Hospital</a>
 for 20 years
before he became a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous.  And he is not against A.A., he absolutely
loves it. He insists that everybody should get shoved into A.A. even if it does not work, so
that they can &quot;get an attitude change from confession of sins to a high-status healer.&quot;
George Vaillant is in love with the cult religion.
He doesn't seem to care that the program fails to save people's lives.

I never said anything like that, and neither did Dr. Vaillant. Don't be ridiculous.
What Dr. Vaillant reported was that out of his first 100 patients, whom he tracked for 8 years,
the score was: 5 sober, 29 dead, 66 still drinking.  That is nearly a 6-to-1 dead-to-sober ratio.

Baloney. Ever heard of Greg Muth, President and General Manager, who took home $250,000 per year,
at least, and gave his lawyer friend Thomas Jasper $469,000 of A.A. funds as a going-away present?
<p>
Now the current chair of the General Service Board, elected in 2009, is the Very
Reverend Ward Ewing, Class A Trustee and just retired President, General Theological
Seminary, NYC (Episcopal).  So, finally a man of the cloth as the head.
<p>
And the General Manager of AA's General Service Office is
<a href="orange-letters325.html#Halliday" target="_blank">Phyllis Halliday</a>.

</blockquote>
Oh, I have read the book, and it is a pack of lies and cult religion bullshit. And that's why
I criticize it.

<p><li>
Then you quoted my last response to you, and you failed to absorb a single fact from it.

<p><li>
Lastly, about your quote about The Library of Congress having a show, and
the <i>Big Book</i> being one of the books that shaped America:
Some librarian wrote some fluff:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; (1939)
The famous 12-step program for stopping an addiction has sold more than 30 million
copies. Millions of men and women worldwide have turned to the program co-founded by
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith to recover from alcoholism.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, millions of people turned to &quot;the Program&quot;, and it failed them. It turned out to be a fraud
and a hoax that didn't work to make people quit drinking. So they threw the book in the trash can.
30 million of them.
<p>
And yes, the A.A. &quot;Big Book&quot; is a book that shaped America just like
how <i>Mein Kampf</i> is a best-selling book that shaped Germany.  Both books are
packs of lies that harmed people.  America is worse off for the 12-Step hoax.

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day now.
