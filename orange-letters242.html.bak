Subject: Hello and a few questions for you :)

<p>
Hey There, Orange.

<p>
I have a few questions for you, if you've got a second.  First, would you say you
were more liberal or libertarian?  I know, it says you're indie on your FB
information.  Also, are you a supporter of Jack Tripley?  I think some of Jack's
ideas are interesting and superior to the AA ideology; however, I mostly think he is
overly consevative, pedantic, and maybe even slightly crazy. In this same line, I
would like to know your thoughts on Stanton Peele; I think he is OK, particulaly in
comparison with Jack.  And he's got a great voice to listen to.

<p>
I am also wondering if you are a reader of fiction (I think you probably tend to
read current nonfiction, right?) and if so, who are your favorite authors.

<p>
Much thanks and have a super day,<br>
Megan

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Megan,
<p>
That's a bunch of interesting questions.
Well, starting at the top:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Definitely more liberal than libertarian. I don't think much of the libertarian philosophy. I think it's a sham.
As one political pundit declared, Libertarians are just Republicans who want to smoke pot.
<p>
I once read a &quot;libertarian&quot; novel. I wish I could remember the name
of it. But the gist of it was that this young man
who was just setting out in the world got a money-belt from his father, filled with gold coins, and for the
rest of the novel, he bought what he needed. If he needed some security or mercenary fighters to help him
in a fight,
he hired them. He bought all of the tools and equipment that he needed for his adventures and exploits.
He never partook of social services, because there weren't any in his world. From
the  beginning to the end of the novel, he simply paid his way and bought what he wanted.
And eventually, he triumphed over the bad guys and got the girl and all of that.
<p>
The problem with that story is obvious. If Daddy Warbucks hadn't given the kid the gold coins, he wouldn't
have accomplished anything. That was not a story of the independent self-reliant man taking care of himself
in a tough world, it was the story of a kid in a shopping mall with Daddy's credit cards.

<p>
The entire Libertarian philosophy has the same problem. So do Ayn Rand's delusions.
There is no such thing as a self-made man. I'm sure
that his Mama has strong opinions on the subject of who made him.

<p><li>
Jack Trimpey seems okay. I totally agree with the idea of &quot;The Beast&quot;,
the addictive voice urging us to just indulge a little.
I stumbled across the same thing, and called it
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.

<p>
I disagree with Trimpey's harsh denunciations of addicts and alcoholics. He calls them immoral. I don't. The way
I see it, we are all just trying to make it through the night. At least half of all addicts and alcoholics are suffering
from underlying conditions like mental illness, child abuse issues, rape issues, and the like, and they are
just trying to kill the pain and get straight. That isn't immoral.

<p><li>
I love Stanton Peele. I think he's right on. I just don't have any criticism of him.

<p><li>
Reading fiction. Wow. It's been a while. I really have to strain my brain to remember the last fiction
that I read. Now I'm not against fiction. When I was in high school I was a big Hemingway and Steinbeck
fan. It's just that I almost exclusively read factual stuff now.  I just don't get around to reading
fiction much any more.
<p>
The last fiction that I can remember reading is William Gibson  &#8212;
things like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;,
and &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;.
That last one is a real hoot. What if Charles Babbage had finished his gearwheel computer in the Victorian
era, and Great Britain had become the computing powerhouse of the world? It almost happened.
It's a very realistic plot.
The only reason that it didn't happen is because Babbage's family was angry about the large amounts of
money (the whole family fortune) that he was spending on his computer, so they had him declared insane and
stopped the project.
<p>
But if things had been a little different, things would be very different.
<p>
By the way, the society of &quot;friends of Babbage&quot; finished his Difference Engine in 1991, and it worked perfectly.
Charles Babbage knew what he was doing. And his girlfriend, Lady Ada, was the world's first computer programmer,
too. She was writing programs for the thing before it was even finished.

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day now.

Well, then the way to do that would be to start with a &quot;relapse&quot;, and here is why:
<p>
1.) If you &quot;lapse&quot;, it is obvious that the &quot;treatment&quot; (12-Steppism) DID NOT WORK,
so why would the HMO continue to pay for what clearly DID NOT WORK, or does the HMO
like to pay for treatments that clearly FAIL?

<p>
2.) If there is a &quot;medical basis&quot; (e.g. a &quot;disease&quot;) for this &quot;addiction&quot; you have,
what makes this &quot;disease&quot; (called &quot;addiction&quot;) a &quot;disease&quot;? HOW has your HMO been
convinced that addiction to ANY chemical substance is a &quot;disease&quot; when there is
ZERO, OBJECTIVE MEDICAL EVIDENCE OF THAT (I don't think a VOTE by an AMA convention
in the 1960's qualifies!).


<p>
3.) Find out HOW MANY TIMES you can &quot;relapse&quot; with this &quot;disease&quot; you allegedly
have (that your HMO must think exists, because they ARE paying for it, right?), and
ask if the same &quot;limit&quot; applies to say, cancer, diabetes, high-blood pressure, etc.
I bet anything that you have a LIMIT for the number of times you can be in
&quot;in-patient&quot; treatment for drug/alcohol &quot;treatment&quot;!

<p>
These are the questions/issues that HMO's need to have thrust in front of them!
Once they see the BULLSHIT that 12-Step treatment is, they WILL STOP PAYING FOR IT,
and once the lawsuits come out (from treatment centers, etc., and others that are
dependant on an HMO tit&quot;, the answers to questions 1 and 2 can be
answered/addressed in said lawsuits! ;)

And who LEAST believes in the disase bullshit? STEPPERS THEMSELVES! Get this, just
from popular culture:
<p>
You can't watch a single sporting event or entertainment awards show anymore without
seeing participants wearing some colored wristband, ribbon, or something in the
&quot;Fight Against Cancer/diabetes/autism/terrorism/whatever the fuck you want.&quot; But
where's the Battle Against Addiction... as in a CURE?
<p>
AA estimates its U.S. membership at around 1 millon persons. If each member gave an
avg of $5 each to a research fund at Johns Hopkins or Mayo or UCLA they could go a
long way to at least beginning to CURE this &quot;physical illness.&quot;
<p>
If I had an ailment killing me and I had  network of fellow sufferers gathering in
church basements and Alano Clubs 7 nights per week I would be damn sure organizing a
fundraising drive to CURE this PHYSICAL, DEADLY, HOPELESS condition. But the absence
of any such effort on the part of steppers proves that they themselves don't really
believe the disease nonsense.

Hi John,
<p>
Yes, you and Jeff make a bunch of good points there. The one that really stands out to me is the
fact that health insurance policies put a limit on treatment of drug and alcohol problems.
The last health insurance policy that I had would send somebody to
alcoholism treatment just one time, ever.
But there were no such limits on the treatment of cancer or heart attacks or AIDS or diabetes
or car accidents or anything else...
<p>
That is highly revealing.  If alcoholism was really a disease, would that even be legal?

Subject:  	AA &quot;success&quot; rate<br>

<p>
Hello again Terrance, greetings. The following quote is from your reply to
<a href="orange-letters232.html#Gordon" target="_blank">my letter in 'Letters 232'</a>.
&quot;I don't understand what you mean by this statement:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

The spontaneous remission rate for alcoholics is 5%; the 'success' rate for AA is
5%, no better than doing nothing at all. This is only true */if the spontaneous
remission people disappear/* and that is our problem, /*they are still around*/.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Yes, it is poorly worded by me, to clarify:-

<p>
People quit booze on their own without any outside help (spontaneous remission) at a
rate of 5%.

<p>
Along comes AA with a 'success' rate of 5%. If this is in addition to spontaneous
remission then the 'quit booze' rate nearly doubles to near 10% and AA is
successful. (5% + AA's 5% of the other 95%)

<p>
However, if the spontaneous remission rate falls to 0%, i.e. AA simply mops up those
who were about to quit on their own anyway, then AA is useless. This is what I was
trying to say, &quot;This (AA is useless) is only true if the spontaneous remissiom
people disappear (into AA) and that is our problem, they are still around (the
spontaneous remission rate has not fallen to 0%, loads of people still quit on their
own outside AA)&quot;.

<p>
There you are, clear as mud!

<p>
Best Regards and keep up the good work. Gordon.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Gordon,
<p>
I see what the problem is. You are thinking of the spontaneous remission rate as a variable
(that might change in response to A.A.). Think of the spontaneous remission rate as a constant,
something that is just there no matter what.
The spontaneous remission rate will be the same no matter whether alcoholics get no help or treatment at all,
or go to the local Tiddly-Winks Society, or to the Ladies' Home Garden Club, or to A.A.

<p>
When A.A. produces a zero-percent improvement in the sobriety rate of alcoholics, it will appear
to have a 5% success rate. But the A.A. program is not due the credit for those recoveries.
That's just the normal rate of spontaneous remission.
Those are the people who would have quit drinking anyway.

<p>
And the A.A. success rate doesn't rise to 10%, because A.A. has no success rate of its own to add
to the normal rate of spontaneous remission. The observed success rate just stays flat at 5%.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<b>The Statistics of Small Numbers</b> means that you only observe a small number of cases
and then generalize a big picture, as in,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;They say that one out of every five people on Earth is Chinese.
That can't be true. I know hundreds and hundreds of people, and
only three of them are Chinese. So Chinese people must be pretty
rare, really...&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Defenders of A.A. use similar bad logic:
<font color="black">
&quot;I've been to 20 different A.A. meetings, and never saw a girl get taken advantage of.&quot;
</font>
<p>
But A.A. likes to brag that there are many hundreds of A.A. meetings in every city  &#8212;  hundreds of
thousands of meetings in the world. Just because you
didn't see something doesn't mean that it didn't happen someplace else.
<p>
In addition, failure to see something does not prove that it does not exist. Absence of evidence is
not evidence of absence.
<p>
By the way, I get reports of bad things happening in A.A. in the U.K. too.


<p>
The <b>Glittering Generality</b> is trying to paint A.A. as a wonderful faultless organization:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...where I am from
people in AA will go out of their way to help you, and expect nothing from you
in return.
<br>
How can that possibly ever be a bad thing?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
If that were an accurate picture of Alcoholics Anonymous, then it would not be a bad thing.
But there is much more to A.A.: the 13th-Stepping and sexual exploitation of girls and women,
the insane cult religion nutcases telling sick people not to take their medications and just
trust God and the 12 Steps to heal them, and the mental cases acting as sponsors and trying to
tell other people how to live, just for starters.
Then there is the whole delusional idea that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's crazy fascist cult religion is a cure for
alcoholism</a>.
Read the list of A.A. horror stories for lots more examples:
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="newwin77">A.A. horror stories here</a>.


<p>
The <b>Minimization and Denial</b> is obvious.
<i><font color="black">&quot;Sure, A.A. is not perfect...&quot;</font></i>
 Even when hundreds of people write in, reporting their
bad experiences and problems with A.A., you just minimize and deny the evidence. Denial isn't just a 
river in Egypt.

<p>
The <b>Spurious Delegitimization</b> is trying to claim that a girl is to blame for all of my criticism
of A.A.
<p>
Actually, the person who really yanked my chain was a dogmatic 12-Step-oriented &quot;counselor&quot; who turned

We both want to cause AA some pain.  But AA is so slippery! Ho do you harm an

admire your efforts to hurt the ideas of AA. Do you have any ideas?  Has anyone else
asked you this before?

Hi Kate,
<p>
Thanks for the question. Oh, that is a tough one. One of the toughest of all.

<p>
Coincidentally, just last night there was a human interest story on the evening news.
About fifteen years ago, a woman's teenage son was shot and killed by
another teenager in a stupid juvenile squabble. And it was her only son.
<p>
The killer was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
<p>
Remarkably, the mother ended up visiting the killer in prison, and befriending him.
She said that at first she did it because she was a Christian, and if there was a chance
to reach the young man, and help him to be a better person, she had to do it. Later, she did it because she
got to know the guy and actually like him. When he got out of prison, she even got him
housing <i>next door to her</i>.
<p>
Here is the punch line: When asked about the forgiveness, the woman said
that she didn't do it for the young man, she did it for herself.
She said that anger and hatred are like a cancer that will eat you from the inside out.
She just had to let go of the anger to be able to live.
<p>
That is the big important point: She did it for herself, not for the other guy.
<p>
I also have my own list of people I'd like to get revenge on, but I have to let it go.
If I keep that list, and dwell on it, I will just end up an angry bitter old man.
The world has enough of them already, thank you anyway.

<p>
Now that does not mean that you do nothing. You can use your feelings and your energy to expose A.A.
for what it is.
You can write and speak and post, and read and learn more.
<p>
But please remember that the individual people who make up A.A. are just sick, deluded people
who imagine that practicing an old pro-fascist cult religion will accomplish great things.
They are of course insane.
<p>
Then, I know that there are genuinely evil people in A.A. too: the monsters who delight in sexually
exploiting the girls, and the tyrants who enjoy lording it over the newcomers and sponsees, and
the fools who don't care who else they hurt in pursuit of their own ego gratification.
They are harder to forgive. But still, you have to let it go, or else the anger will just eat your guts out.

<p>
So you can start by writing to your Congressman (or Congresswoman) and two Senators, telling them about
the hoax that the 12-Step treatment industry is foisting on America while consuming precious taxpayer
dollars.
Writing on paper is much better than emailing, and has more effect, and your letter stays around longer.
<p>
Then you can just keep on speaking the truth. The truth is the mortal enemy of the Big Lie, and that is
what A.A. is, a big lie. If enough people knew the truth, A.A. would collapse and vanish like all of
those strange old cult religions from the eighteen hundreds that we never even hear of any more.
<p>
Heck, for that matter,
have you even heard of any Rajneeshies lately? Or followers of Rev. Jim Jones's <i>People's Temple</i>?
Seen any Hari Krishnas? Heaven's Gate? Synanon? As the truth gets out, those things just whither and die.

<p>
And don't worry about whether the people in those A.A. meetings know what you are doing. They will, eventually,
as their membership walks away and the group shrinks.
And they will, when they find that newcomers are better informed, and ask too many discerning questions.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

Good stuff, but a waste of time. The programs do work even if one person has been
saved. Please find something more constructive to spend your time. Your attempt to
undermine the fellowships is  equivalent to Scientology  attempting to undermine the
Catholic religion. Reality is it will never happen.

Hello Christopher,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. The lame rationalization that A.A. is okay &quot;even if one person has been
saved&quot; is without merit. The truth is, A.A. kills more people with misinformation and
quack medicine than it ever saves.
Even a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., proved that.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
Telling the truth about the the 12-Step cult religion fraud that is
called &quot;the recovery industry&quot; is not like Scientology.
Scientology is a hoax very much like Alcoholics Anonymous.
Both are cult religions that were founded by a raving lunatic.
Both have their holy scriptures that are just plain wrong.
Both sell a fairy tale as a cure for deadly addiction problems.
The only difference between two is that A.A. wants your mind, your life and your soul, while Scientology
wants your mind, your life, your soul, and your money.
<p>
Scientology calls their &quot;addiction cure&quot; racket &quot;Narconon&quot;.

Have a good day.

Orange-
<p>
I was reading your website as I often do, and I saw this info re: Vaillant-
<a href="orange-letters206.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters206.html#Vaillant</a>

<p>
Where the hell does AA get this info that it publishes in their literature? Do you
have any idea? Thanks for your work man. Peace.

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Grapevine: You said about 40 percent of the people who remain abstinent do it
through AA. What about the other 60 percent? Could we in AA be more open, more
supportive of these?

<p>
George Vaillant: Yes. You know, if you're batting 400, it's all right to miss a few.
I think the fact that AA knows the answer to an extremely complicated problem is
probably all right.

<p>
But it doesn't hurt at the level of GSO for AA to have humility and understand that
60 percent do it without AA. It's also true that most of those 60 percent do it with[out?]
the AA toolbox: their spirituality doesn't come from AA; their support group doesn't
come from AA; and what I call &quot;substitute dependency&quot; doesn't come from AA. But they
still use the same ingredients that AA uses.

<p>
And I don't think there's anything that the other 60 percent are doing that AA needs
to learn from, except: &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; If you meet someone who
has stayed sober for more than three years and they're pleased and boasting that
they did it without AA, thank your Higher Power for another recovery. You know,
there's &quot;little&quot; sobriety, being dry, and there's sobriety with a big S, which
includes humility and not thinking that you're the center of the earth. So if
someone is doing something without your help, good enough.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Daniel,
<p>
Thanks for the question. That's a great question.
<p>
Where do they get their numbers? Well, they just make them up. Even George Vaillant was giving
out false information there. Perhaps you thought that he was being generous and honest by admitting that 60%
of the sober people did it without A.A.? Nope. He wasn't telling the truth either.
<p>
Here is the truth:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The NIAAA's 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol
dependence found in the DSM-IV, they found:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do
so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab)
programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever
receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So the NIAAA says that 75% quit drinking alone, on their own. The most that A.A. could possibly have
is 25%, not 40%. But A.A. doesn't get that remaining 25%. Not even close.
That 25% includes <i>everybody else who ever got <b>any</b> kind of help or &quot;treatment&quot;.</i>
<p>
That 25% includes people who went to the Catholic Church and participated in the
Calix or St. Vincent DePaul programs.
Or did a fundamentalist Protestant program like
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Saddleback" target="_blank">Saddleback</a>.
Or went to the Salvation Army program.
Or did the Veterans' Administration program.
Or went to SMART, SOS, WFS, Rational Recovery, or the like.
Or got &quot;treatment&quot; from a &quot;treatment center&quot;.

<p>
I fall into that last category, theoretically. I allegedly went through a treatment program.
The State of Oregon Health Plan (OHP) paid $1700 for my &quot;treatment&quot;.
But 
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">all that it amounted to was</a>
three &quot;group therapy&quot; sessions per week,
conducted by a cocaine-snorting Internet-pornographer child-molester who
yammered a lot of A.A. slogans and insisted that we must
have a &quot;higher power&quot; in our &quot;recovery program&quot;.
And then they stuck acupuncture needles in us and said that it reduced our cravings.
And then he told us to go to at least three A.A. or N.A. meetings per week.
Oh, and they made us piss in a cup to see if we were taking drugs.
That's it. That's &quot;the cure&quot;.

<p>
I got myself sober two weeks before that &quot;program&quot; started,
so I give it zero credit for my recovery.
&quot;Treatment&quot; was just one more painful experience that I had to endure.

<p>
So the truth is, the number of people that A.A. can really claim to have cured is miniscule.
Other great quotes from Dr. Vaillant declare that A.A. produced a zero-percent improvement
in the recovery of alcoholics, while producing the highest death rate of any method for treating
alcoholism. <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Orange Papers just thanked me for a shout out i sent his way and I can't express in words how much that means to me. He is my hero. His website was exactly what I needed to stumble across in order to remove myself from the offensively addictive cult we call Alcoholics Anonymous. Although the doubts were already there, I pushed them to the side and told myself &quot;not up for discussion.&quot;

<p>
This was because I was told there was no other alternative and I would die if I didn't do it their way. He vocalized so many truths on the horrific epidemic that I was scared to even discuss in my own mind. It's kind of similar to walking in religion on blind faith because of fear or guilt trips. Is that really &quot;happy, joyous, and free?&quot; Use your higher power given brains and open your eyes. A Narcissistic addict just tricked the world into following a program that is not working. Can we say ILLUMINATI? Just another example of &quot;New World Order.&quot; Wake up people. You are being Duped. The signs are obvious. It sounds nice. Lives do get saved, while immediately becoming enslaved. You are told that if you leave the group, you will die a terrible death. Your only option is AA. Wait a second...what about the contradictive statement i heard repetitively, that stuck in my head the most: &quot;Take what you need, and leave the rest.&quot; Cool, thanks for the kind words and beautiful souls. I don't stick around one spot too long. I learned mad shit. I played mad games. I walked away the same way I walked in, slick and quiet as fuck. Nobody had a clue, including myself. Maybe if I was treated with more respect then I would have reconsidered my permanent exit. However, I wasn't, so therefore, I do not feel the need to be abused by a bunch of boys with the mentality of toddlers and a bunch of women with the jealously of high school girls. I hope you can understand. Have a nice day and remember that it aint my fault bitch.

Subject:  	Incredible information. Thank you!<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
I have been reading through your incredibly thorough site for the better part of a
month now. It has helped me immensely in my deprogramming process from the pseudo
religious cult of 12 steppism. Thank you for the enormous effort that must have went
into creating the Orange Papers. They are a huge help!

<p>
I voluntarily attended AA meetings for about 2 1/2 years, then my attendance started
to drop off drastically. I never could quite identify with the fellowship and I
always felt like I was on the periphery of the program. If you weren't a regular,
good little Wilsonite, you were never fully &quot;one of them.&quot; All I ever heard besides
praising the program and drunkalouges, were slogans. They have stupid little
clich&eacute;s for everything! Whenever I asked for clarity, or explanations, there was a
ready-made slogan for a response. The way they sucker you into the whole thing is
just purely deceptive.

<p>
So much of my experience with AA seemed surreal. It is so contradictory. They stress
to a newcomer to keep an open mind, yet the entire doctrine is closed minded, and so
were most of the people I encountered at meetings. No original thought permitted!
Buchman and Wilson's fake, outdated, twisted ideology removes individuality, shuns
free thinking, destroys the will, closes the mind and crushes the spirit. It breaks
down the detoxing, stressed and often desperate newcomer and rebuilds them in the
image of the program (cult).

<p>
I especially loved the historical research you have presented. I feel that it is
very important to understand the roots of an organization such as AA, to gain a
clear understanding of that which it was founded upon. Hmm, a psycho, a Hitler
supporter and a proctologist put this thing together?
 That's a religion for me!
<p>
Speaking of Dr. Bob: that guy was surrounded by assholes, both literally and
figuratively!

<p>
The fact that AA has scammed its way into the health field and the justice system,
and generates billions in league with the recovery industry, all by proselytizing
Wilson's alcoholic philosophy, illustrates what a scam the whole thing really is. It
dawned on me; the recovery industry does not want a system that works. There is no
profit in the cure.

<p>
I've been to several cult gatherings, where court-ordered, people in state rehab
facilities were bussed in, and so few of the ones mandated by the courts stick
around much when their sentence is up. I've seen so many come and go in my time with
AA. There seems to be a core of people, who have made AA their life, and then a
bunch that just come and go. The whole system is a colossal failure. And the ones
that have given their lives to it, behave just like you would expect any cult member
to.

<p>
My first sponsor was an arrogant, passive-aggressive, true believer who walked me
through the first 4 steps and also recommended 90 in 90 which I did. It's so damned
depressing going to those things every day and hearing people recycle the same old
trite slogans, boring war stories and endless praise for the most perfect
fellowship. His royal highness also suggested that I &quot;hit my knees.&quot; I never did
because I don't pray that way. In fact I disregarded much of his advice, and
resisted anyone trying to run my life for me. But that didn't stop them from trying.

<p>
There's so much more, I could probably pump out pages and pages. I knew I didn't
need AA anymore (if I ever really did) when I went through a very tragic event, and
shortly thereafter was diagnosed with a serious, incurable and progressive illness
(you know, like alcoholism) and didn't need to go to a meeting to &quot;share&quot; nor did I
have the urge to drink. I was no longer attending meetings and I started to heal the
moment I made the decision to end my membership permanently. For so long, something
just didn't feel right. Then, for no apparent reason, I googled: &quot;is AA a cult&quot;&quot; and
then the dam broke open. I found the Orange Papers and I've been pouring through
them ever since. They are such a tremendous help to someone who was in my position
and I also realized I'm not alone. Thank you again!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Doug,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments, and I'm glad to hear that your mind is alive and free.
And congratulations on your sobriety too.

<p>
One line really resonated for me: &quot;They don't want a cure because there is no profit in a cure.&quot;
Yes. That is a real serious problem with our whole medical system. Medicines that merely treat, but do not
cure, a disease, are much more profitable than ones that cure. When cured, the patient doesn't
buy any more medicine. But if the pharmaceutical companies can get people habituated to taking
an endless stream of pills that don't ever quite cure,
then they have a customer for life. So what are the pharmaceutical companies pushing?
Things like Viagra, Boneva, and cholestrol-lowering drugs, and blood-pressure medications,
and arthritis medications, and diet pills  &#8212;  anything that you have to take for the rest of your life.
<p>
We are actually heading for a bad medical crisis because the germs are growing resistant to all
of our antibiotics, and the pharmaceutical companies are not developing new antibiotics. There is
no money in it. Not like the money from Viagra and Levitra and Cialis.
<p>
We really should have some government labs develop new antibiotics fast, but the Republicans won't
tolerate &quot;socialized medicine&quot; where the government &quot;goes into competition with private enterprise&quot;.
The government laboratories won't actually be in competition with the
pharmaceutical companies, not when those corporations 
refuse to make new antibiotics.  But the Republicans would rather let our children die from flesh-eating
bacteria than let &quot;big government&quot; get into medicine.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

A quick hello. Thank you for accepting my friend request. Your writing via the
Orange Papers site has been very educational, and at the risk of being dramatic,
inspiring.  I was caught up in the nightmare of the 12 steps off and on for many
years. I have watched AA dogma kill a friend. I can't prove it, but nevertheless she
is dead. I refuse to attend meetings. I am sober and still alive. I also quit
smoking a few years ago. I no longer smoke nor ingest alcohol. Abstinence is
sobriety, period.

<p>
That aside for the time being. although I am a Canadian existing out here on the
great prairie, I find many of our political and personal ideas mesh. We do have much
in common, and as is normal  we differ in some respects. I enjoy creative writing
immensely, and have found a place for it in my life and day to day routine. Perhaps
someday I will be published, what a great day that would be. But writing is in
itself a reward. It is very therapeutic for me.  I am an avid reader and enjoy your
writing. How much writing do you do beyond the 'Papers'?

<p>
I have a hell of a time keeping anything I write 'short'. I will end it on this
note; You are a great writer and an intelligent man. I admire your tenacity and

Hi Orange,

<p>
&quot;&quot;Others can help and support you...but in the end it is ONLY you that can save
yourself. You have the fantastic gift of free will, along with that gift comes
ultimate responsibility. You are accountable for the good and bad choices you make.
Accept the consequences for the bad, but also claim the credit and praise for the
good. Have a great day my friends.&quot;&quot;

Hello Darren,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments, and you have a good weekend too.
<p>
Oh, and I love that last paragraph. That says it all.

Dear Orange,
<p>
I hope you are well. It has been over four months since I stopped going to AA and
life is better than ever. I am the one responsible for not drinking and that is a
very empowering act. yesterday I had coffee with a stepper who said:  &quot;We are
worried about you and want you to come back. Some people heard that you called AA a
cult.&quot; I replied: &quot;only a cult would care if I was a member or not.&quot; Then the
stepper told me stories of a meeting he attended where a newcomer made a racist
comment to him which appalled me (most likely the newcomer was a court ordered
attendee who was acting out of defiance). I replied that &quot;Why did you not leave or
any one defend you, or call out the newcomer for intolerant behavior?&quot; And the
stepper could only make the excuse that the newcomer came first and was a sick
person. My response was that AA meetings are full of toxic people who can not
possibly help you.

<p>
So far I can report that I consider my problems were behavioral, and for that there
are therapies and medical treatment which work if one applies themselves. it is very
important to stay away from meetings because sick people can not help sick people
get better.

<p>
So I have this question:  if alcoholism is a disease then how did I stop without any
therapy, drug, or other medical intervention? And since I have stopped,on my own
what happened to the &quot;disease&quot;? Real diseases don't just disappear on their own.
well take care and keep up the good work.

Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You've got it. I don't need to tell you anything.
<p>
So have a good day and a good life now.

 I wanted to thank you for saving my life. you have no idea the
torment I endured 12 years in and out of that program. I have seen the
worst of the worst. It wasn't till I read your website, that I was
finally free. But I never stop fighting. I always fight those who try to
 go to 12 step rehabs or send their families there. Not knowing what
they get into.
<p>
Anyway, thank you for saving my life.

Hi. I just found your letters. Honestly, you saved your own
life. But if I was able to help in some small way, then great.
<p>
So have a good day now.

Flock of geese shows that birds are amazing surfers, too<br>
By: Pete Thomas, GrindTV.com<br>
Birds of a feather not only flock together, they surf together. That was the case,
anyway, involving several geese that rode downstream and collectively caught, and
rode for several seconds, a standing wave in swift-water conditions at Glenwood
Springs Whitewater Park on the Colorado River. The event was posted onto YouTube
this past week by a user named AlSwearengen15, who apologized for his brief laughter
because a few geese appear to have been temporarily swamped. &quot;But seeing them catch
the wave in unison was unexpected,&quot; the videographer explained. Also unexpected was
how remarkably well most of the flock handled the wave. Take a gander:

Hello Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the link. Yes, videos are working at the moment, so I saw that. What nobody mentioned was
that the geese were a family with half a dozen children. Look closely, and you will see that several of
them are small.  Nevertheless, they handled the river quite well.
<p>
Something that took me a while to get used to was just how drown-proof little goslings really are.
You would think those cute little fluff-balls would be at the mercy of the river. Nope, they just ride it.
They are water birds, and they are totally at home on the water.
They've been doing it for about the last million years.
<p>
Have a good day now.
