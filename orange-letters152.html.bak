Mr. Orange, (sounds like Reservoir Dogs)

<p>
I've read your site a few times and just found a link from a recovery site!

<p>
It's good to be critical of AA.  But I can see where you either exaggerate or
completely take out-of context certain complaints and problems, or even invent them.

<p>
For example, almost no one says, &quot;listen to the voices in your head and do exactly
what they say&quot;.  Even the AA Big Book says the opposite.  It says your intuition
will grow and become more sound and sane, when the effects of overwhelming
self-centeredness are reduced or eliminated, but it cautions to be very careful
applying sudden new inspirations to your life.  They might be absurd inspirations
invented by your own twisted mind.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Gary,
<p>
Actually, what Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> was
that you are not qualified to hear the
Voice of God, so you should listen to your sponsor and other group elders,
and they will tell you what God says.  Theoretically, you are still supposed
to do what the voice in your head (&quot;God&quot;) says when you do a
 Step 11, but since you are allegedly so
 &quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#inexperienced" target="newwin73">inexperienced in making conscious contact with God</a>&quot;,
 you
should listen to other people instead. That is a standard cultish
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#surrender2God" target="newwin79">bait-and-switch trick</a>.
  First it's &quot;Listen to God&quot;, and then it's &quot;Listen to the cult leaders.&quot;
<p>
It is also cultish arrogance &#8212; Bill Wilson declared that newcomers
had never had any experience with God before they came to his cult religion.
As if all other religions in the world are invalid and ineffective.

<p>
As far as the &quot;intuition growing&quot;, that sounds like so much wishful thinking.
People's intuition doesn't improve from practicing an old cult religion.

</font>
<p>
Yet on the other hand, many people (outside AA) find themselves empowered to act on
intuition alongside hard facts and pure logic.  Many of these people are successful,
including in business, if they are not too bizarre.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What you are calling intuition is often just educated guess-work &#8212;
making the right choice based on partial data and sketchy information.
(Of course, you don't hear about the other people who went broke because
their &quot;intuition&quot; made the wrong choice. They aren't bragging about
their intuition.)
</font>
<p>
Similar issues with sexual abuse.  Alternative Views covered a very credible
story/book of major corporations in Texas paying for a group of runaway teenage boys
to serve the perverted sexual needs and power-tripping of their major corporate
managers, leaders, and patrons.  Does this mean all business is bad?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I guess you are trying to rationalize away and gloss over
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin73">the
 Midtown Group</a>
and Pacific Group.  The problem there is that the A.A. headquarters will
not do anything to stop the abuse or fix the situation. So yes, that
reflects on the whole organization.

</font>
<p>
I can see the point of &quot;making amends&quot; in a modified way to a childhood abuser,
sexual or violent.  Perhaps the person has changed.  My former girlfriend, who is
NOT an AA member, now gets along fine with her grown and mature father.  They have
lunch regularly.  But when she was young, he was a horror, mean, violent and cheated
on her mother.  As a matter of fact, our breakup was largely due to the fact that
while she forgave her &quot;today&quot; dad she was still stinging from her childhood abuse,
and guess whose personality reminded her of her childhood dad.  Me.  I was &quot;too
cocky&quot;, which she both liked and feared.

<p>
This is one more classic example of how the normal human ego has great difficulty in
putting the past in the past and moving on.  People everywhere carry a lot of
baggage of their past &#8212; understandably &#8212; and it's often crippling.

<p>
The point of &quot;making amends&quot; is &quot;healing relationships&quot; and letting go of
long-standing bitter hatreds and hurt.  Some of this involves apologizing for one's
own shortcomings and abuses.  It is presumed that the average alcoholic was very
abusive in a variety of ways, as is usually the case.  At the time AA was developed,
the discussion of childhood sexual abuse was taboo, moreso than discussing
alcoholism, but it happened regularly.  Incest not a new phenomenon.

<p>
Yet now the discussion about incest and childhood abuse is more in the open, so AA
must find ways to face that as a reality.  The original Big Book was not written
with that specificity.  The &quot;more will be revealed to us&quot; section must apply to
that.  It suggests that AA is not a set of hard-and-fast rules, but that common
sense, intuition, and wisdom must be applied, as new approaches are invented to
match current conditions.

<p>
The AA model, at it's essence, involves in large part the ability to let go of
&quot;Self&quot;, especially the crippling parts of one's identity, and allowing a new
healthier &quot;Self&quot; to emerge.  At the same time, the crippling over-attention to Self
(natural, if &quot;Self&quot; is experiencing some forms of psychic pain that one typically
treats with a mental anesthetic such as booze) gets reduced to a more manageable
size.

<p>
A Taoist saying around this matter involves a &quot;pebble in one's shoe&quot; or other minor
ache that tends to bother the individual more than the deaths of millions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is quite a rap about &quot;making amends&quot;, but there is zero evidence
that going around saying &quot;I'm sorry&quot; to everybody fixes anything, or
improves the world.
<p>
Spending so much time in the past is not necessarily healthy either.

</font>
<p>
Another fable along these lines (I believe) is the Princess and the Pea.  The
Princess suffered because a tiny pea (of psychic pain) kept her up at night, and no
matter how many fluffy mattresses she applied to the problem, she remained troubled.
It was not until the pea was removed that she was able to sleep comfortably
&#8212; to forget.

<p>
<font color="blue">
? And the point is?
Do you actually imagine that 
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#confessions1" target="newwin83">practicing Buchmanism</a> 
 removes psychic pain?

</font>
<p>
The way AA Steps looks into the past, it's a matter of clearly remembering and
examination for the ultimate goal of &quot;forgetting&quot;.  Of course, one never truly
forgets the past, unless they mentally suppress it (which often leads to
schizophrenic or other disorders), or if they suffer from some sort of amnesia, but
the sharp emotional pain of the past gets &quot;forgotten&quot; in the sense that Chinese
philosophy explains.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Recalling everything that someone ever did wrong is not &quot;forgetting
the past&quot;, it is recalling the past. For some people, that
routine is so depressing that
<a href="orange-letters139.html#suicide" target="newwin81">they commit suicide</a>.

</font>
<p>
You might thank me here.  I doubt very many AA members understand that the reason
for delving deeply into one's past is to ultimately forget it, but in a healthy and
thorough way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Introspection is good, but A.A. just dwells on the negative.
It's another bait-and-switch trick.
<ul>
<li>  The routine is supposed to
be &quot;a searching and fearless moral inventory&quot; in Step 4,
<li>  but
then in Step 5, it's 
all about &quot;the exact nature of our wrongs.&quot;
(What happened to the inventory of our good qualities?)
<li> Then, in Step 6, those wrongs get changed into your &quot;defects of
character.&quot; 
<li> And in Step 7, they are &quot;our shortcomings.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
  That is just another
cultish guilt-induction routine, not good psychotherapy at all.

</font>
<p>
I doubt you will take this much into consideration.  Your website seems to depict
you as deeply committed to tarring AA, not just deservedly for it's goofier
manifestations and misinterpretations, but for even wrongs that YOU have invented.
I hope you would consider mitigating some of your criticisms or being open to
discussing them rationally, seeing BOTH the bad (and weird) in AA and the good and
sound aspects which are sometimes called spiritual in nature, at least non-dogmatic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
 I have considered what you have written. I am very interested in discussing
the 12-Step religion rationally. Unfortunately, rational thinking is very
rare in religious cults.  And trying to claim intangible &quot;spiritual&quot;
benefits from the cult's crazy routines is just what Scientology does, too.
</font>
<p>
The existence of dogmatic people inside the AA culture does not mean that AA itself
is intended to be a dogmatic religion.  However, I agree with you that a lot of it
could be updated and modified to reflect more modern understandings.  In meeting
that adopt a more modern culture, this is already happening.  Some of it perhaps
bad, as the &quot;modern buzzword&quot; psychotherapy gets invoked, stuff from perhaps Oprah
or Dr. Phil.  On the other hand, some mitigation of the older religious dogma is in
order.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I really don't care if A.A. is &quot;intended to be a dogmatic religion.&quot; I care
that A.A. hurts more people than it helps, and won't tell the truth about it.

<p>
Updating A.A.? What not start with actually telling the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth about alcoholism, addiction, recovery,
the history of A.A., and all of the rest of it?  Why is it still necessary
to start every A.A. meeting by reading Bill Wilson's lies from pages 58 through
60 of the <i>Big Book</i>?

</font>
<p>
The same struggle is taking place in politics, between the &quot;old time religion&quot;
exemplified by Bush Believers vs. a more modern secular viewpoint (with some of it's
own shortcomings, the &quot;religion&quot; of modern-ish liberalism).

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is quite an attempt at rationalizing the situation.
But the situation is not conservative old fundamentalists versus the
liberal new thinkers. The situation is that not one word of the Sacred
First 164 Pages has been updated or corrected in the third or fourth editions,
 nor will they ever will be. 
<p>
We still have the problem that the whole 12-Step program is a lie.
It is not a way to overcome addictions; it is a way to indoctrinate
and convert new cult members.
The 12 Steps are just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="newwin74">Dr. Frank Buchman's practices</a>, repackaged.

<p>
Dear orange:

<p>
I've read through the above mentioned document; I'm not quite sure the purpose of
its work; rereading it, I've come to the conclusion that smoking, and therefore,
narcissisim are not conducive &#8212; indicative of recovery.

<p>
Hmm.

<p>
I, unfortunately, smoked for a number of years of sobriety; thankfully, I no longer
smoke. Yes, narcissisim, was, and can be, a persistent character defect in my life;
certainly gounded in self-centeredness; though, the last 24 years of continued
recovery have provided me with the ability of a nightly inventory to reveal such
defects.

<p>
Finally, I must write, that I work in the health care field; I have daily patient
contact as I treat that which is presented, usually (95% self-imposed) illnesses
such as diabetes, depression and overconsumption of... Well, really, choose! With
the latter considered, the best cure for alcoholsim that I've ever found, other than
death, is Alcoholics Anonymous. This leads my to my iniatial and final question:
Have you published anything illuminating the benefits of AA? If not, I would wonder,
why not?

<p>
I recall coming to in the rain forest after a plane crash; after a few days passed,
I was able to move around, determing the Cardinal directions, and make way out so
that I could perhaps return with help. As I approached a river, I saw a young man,
carrying a box. One of the natives that I had come across in the jungle ran past me
and struck the young man. The box fell and broke open, breaking all of its contents.

<p>
The tribal elder had seen the plane go down a few day before he had sent the boy
with the box toward the crash site. The box contained a few antibiotics and other
medicinal supplies which upon falling into the mud when the young man was stuck
became useless to those that greatly required them.

<p>
May you always be fulfilled and at peace,

<p>
Jeffrey A. L.

PS September 28th, 1985 is my date of sobriety. I am married and share with my wife

Hello Jeffrey,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Your story about missionaries in the Amazon is totally irrelevant.
You are assuming that A.A. is somehow like medicines that work properly.
Alcoholics Anonymous is no such thing. A.A. is just quack medicine,
just
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin66">Dr. Frank Buchman's old cult religion</a>.
<p>
A.A. harms more alcoholics than it helps.
When A.A. was tested, it produced very bad results,
like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin43">raising the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin44">
raising the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin45">raising the death rate</a> of alcoholics.

<p>
Now, if you believe that A.A. actually works, please answer this simple
question that no A.A. old-timer has ever answered honestly:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>

seem to exist.
<p>
2.) Why does this thing called &quot;sponsorship&quot; exist in AA/12-Step
groups, when NOTHING is said about it in either the &quot;Big Book&quot; or the
12-Steps?
<p>
3.) Do the 12-Steps mean what is written in them (and say what they
mean?). If so, there is no reason to &quot;explain&quot; them, as their verbage
is clear. If on the other hand, they do NOT &quot;mean what they say&quot; and
&quot;say what they mean&quot;, then their existence is useless, yes?

Subject: RE: Questions that can't get answers<br>
<p>
Dear Mr. McCready,
<p>
Your recent e-mail to the General Service Office came to me, as I
currently have the privilege of serving on the Cooperation With the
Professional Community assignment.  My name is Mary, and I am an
alcoholic.
<p>
We appreciate your interest in Alcoholics Anonymous. You have
reached the General Service Office for the A.A. groups in the
United States and Canada.  This office provides services such as
helping new groups get started, providing information about A.A. to
the general public and professionals, and publishing and
distributing A.A. literature.  G.S.O. also houses a readily
available accumulation of A.A. history and experience.
<p>
I have attempted to provide information regarding your questions as
follows:
<p>
1.)        Thank you for this observation and suggestion. We have a twenty
minute DVD called &quot;Hope&quot; that gives an overview of A.A..  If you
send me your address, I would be delighted to send you a copy.  I
am going to forward your email to the A.A.W.S. Publications
Committee for their consideration.
<p>
2.)        While the word sponsor is not used in the first 164 pages of
the Big Book a quick review of Steps One through Five in Twelve
Steps and Twelve Traditions shows the word sponsor used on pages
22, 26, 39, 46 and 61. In the pamphlet &quot;Questions &amp; Answers on
Sponsorship it says, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous began with sponsorship.
When Bill W., only a few months sober, was stricken with a powerful
urge to drink, this thought came to him: :You need another
alcoholic to talk to.  You need another alcoholic just as much as
he needs you!&quot; ...The word &quot;sponsor&quot; was not used then; the Twelve
Steps had not been written; but Bill carried the message to Dr.
Bob, who in turn, safeguarded his own sobriety by sponsoring
countless other alcoholics.  Through sharing, both of our co-
founders discovered, their own sober lives could be enriched beyond
measure. &quot;This pamphlet located on our web site www.aa.org,
explains sponsorship in detail and can read in full at this link:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222507/http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-15_Q&amp;AonSpon.pdf" target="newwin67">
http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-15_Q&amp;AonSpon.pdf</a>.
<p>
3.)        The General Service Office does not interpret A.A. literature.
Each member is free to find the meaning for him or herself.
Through reading A.A. literature and sharing with other A.A.
members, each alcoholic has the opportunity to come to an
understanding of what a particular phrase or sentence means in
their own experience.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is a worldwide Fellowship of women and men who
have found a solution to their drinking problem.  The only
requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking; there
are no dues or fees.  A.A. is supported solely by voluntary
contributions of its members, neither seeking nor accepting outside
funding.  Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other
alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
<p>
A.A. is not affiliated with any government, philosophy, religion or
outside organization.  As a group, we are non-professional, not
engaging in education, prevention or research.  A.A. has no opinion
on any outside issue, and is unrelated to any form of treatment or
therapy.
<p>
We appreciate this opportunity to provide A.A. information.  Please
let us know if we can be of further assistance or if you would like
to be contacted by an A.A. member who can serve as a resource for
you locally.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

Hi again John,

<p>
Thanks for the input. That is interesting. And I love the question
about why the Steps have to be interpreted.
(And there are so many dozens or hundreds of books that purport to
explain what the 12 Steps really mean.)

<p>
In item 2, what they forgot to mention is that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#original_sponsor" target="newwin56">sponsorship
was a standard practice in the Oxford Group</a>,
and that the practice continued uninterrupted
when Bill Wilson and Dr. Smith took over the alcoholics' branch of the
cult and eventually renamed it to Clarence Snyder's name, &quot;Alcoholics
Anonymous&quot;. Sponsorship was <i>always</i> part of A.A.
<p>
And today, A.A. old-timers who can trace their chain of sponsorship
back to Bill Wilson or Dr. Robert Smith have great bragging rights.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

I learned quite a bit at AA meetings. Now that I am most familiar with their
techniques, staying home and reading your propaganda and debating page over
and over is a far better option.

<p>
Your pages serve all who care to learn. I am sure there are many who shrink
at this exposure to their methods. I see myself and many others in the
techniques. I know to expose them would cause retaliation and fear.

Hello TEM,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. But honestly, I don't really feel
like a hero.

<p>
Print? The dead tree edition? Alas, I might have to bite the bullet
and actually do that, but I'm still thinking about it, and what I think
is that it is a lot of work.
<p>
What I recommend is that people download the archives and burn their
own CDs.  The archives are listed on the main menu page,
<a href="menu1.html#archives" target="newwin45">here</a>.
You can download either the Windoze set or the Linux set. You don't
need both as the files contained in the archives are identical. The
two archives formats are just a convenience for users of
 different operating systems.

<p>
Then you can unpack the archives into an empty subdirectory (&quot;folder&quot;
in Windoweze). Then burn a CD of the whole thing.

<p>
I made all of the links in the pages relative so that the
 whole web site will work well off of a CD.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

I have been an occasional visitor to your web site and always found it interesting
reading. I thought that you and your readers might be interested in my new book on
the history of Moral Re-Armament, with a brief discussion of the creation of
Alcoholics Anonymous. The book is
<b>&quot;Moral Re-Armament: The Reinventions of an American Religious Movement&quot;</b>
 and is published by Palgrave Macmillan.

<p>
I am a historian of American religion and look at MRA within the larger history of
evangelicalism in America. My goal is neither to exalt or debunk MRA. I both admire
its impact on people and am concerned about some of its motives and methods. I hope
that MRA supporters and skeptics like yourself will find value in the book. You can

Date:  	Tue, December 1, 2009 7:38 pm &nbsp; &nbsp; (answered 9 December 2009)<br>
From:  	&quot;Zachary W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank you for an invaluable resource.<br>

<p>
I spent four months in a partial hospitalization substance treatment
program. It was, of course, a 12 step based program. In addition to
the four months of my life consumed by cult indoctrination, I paid a
hefty $30,000 to be brainwashed.

<p>
I was told that I couldn't trust my own mind. That my head was a bad
neighborhood. I have legal issues due to my drug habits and I spent 14
days in jail before admitting myself into treatment. I was totally
detoxed, and fed up with that way of life before entering the program.
I had made a choice prior to going in. Yet I was told I couldn't trust
my own mind and had to rely on a kooky sponsor who I learned had a
much nastier drug problem than I ever did. No, thank you.

<p>
The whole experience wasn't negative, however. The non-aa therapy
sessions with counselors were very helpful. The treatment team was
extremely professional and I had the impression they genuinely cared
about the patients. Unfortunately, they were firmly entrenched in the
12 step dogma.

<p>
I was desperate to change the course of my life. I had reached a very
low point, and was willing to try whatever the professionals
suggested. I let my guard down, trusting in paid medical help. I did
work through some of my psychological issues due to good therapy. I
also became extremely neurotic about everything because I was
programmed to doubt my every thought and action, due to the 12 step
nonsense.

<p>
I was inundated with aa jargon, platitudes and slogans during my stay.
Other clients relapsed around me. There were some scary types in the
treatment facility and daily obligatory aa/na meetings. I felt more
safe in jail. I did everything I was told and I really let myself
believe in what I was being taught. I shared at meetings and spewed
the same nonsense I heard others regurgitating. I became a &quot;friend of
Bill.&quot;

<p>
Yet, underneath, in the back of my consciousness I remained a skeptic.
I am a bit of a manipulator myself (something I currently attend
private therapy for), so I know when I'm being played. I was the good
aa member during my stay, and even two months after leaving treatment.
The wheels fell off mostly due to my interaction with my sponsor.

<p>
My sponsor seemed to think he was a spiritual advisor who could
provide guidance for all areas in my life. The final straw was when I
told him I have decided to finally get a divorce after having been
separated from my wife for 3 years. He told me I shouldn't make any
major decisions or actions in the first year of sobriety. So I should
put myself and my wife through another year of limbo just because my
sponsor advises it? What really burned me is that he didn't even think
of that himself. It was just more AA dogma, passed down to him from
his sponsor, etc. My paid professional private therapist encourages me
to act according to what I deeply feel is in my heart. My AA sponsor
tells me that I can't trust what my heart tells me. But I should
meditate/pray and ask for God's will to be revealed. As long as my
sponsor approves of what God wills me to do. Now if that isn't
Buchmanism, I'll be darned.

<p>
Around the same time, my father commented that I had been essentially
brainwashed in treatment. That was a wake up for me. I started to see
the bigger picture. And then I found your website. I want to thank you
for the enormous time and dedication you have put into your work. When
I first started reading, I found myself responding much like the AA
faithful who write you letters. It took me some time to shed all the
standard responses which were so deeply ingrained in my mind. I
particularly like the proper use of Herbert Spencer's quote in the
heading of your site. The irony wasn't wasted on me, I can tell you.

<p>
I can attest to many of your proposals that AA does more harm than
good. I was convinced that if I had one drink I wouldn't be able to
stop and would have to drink myself to death, due to AA. I agree that
AA can promote more intense binge drinking behavior, due to the
concept of powerlessness.

<p>
I have been drug free since the day I was put in jail. Around 10
months. I occasionally have a drink with friends. I am very aware of
my alcohol intake. I'm more concerned with my tobacco habit at the
moment and your site once again is an invaluable resource for that
drug too.

<p>
I particularly want to counter all the suggestions by other
respondents that you are a &quot;dry drunk,&quot; or filled with hate,
resentments toward AA, or any similar nonsense. I say that anyone who
spends so much time researching and writing such a great work for the
betterment of mankind must be filled with love for his fellows. What
you have created is perhaps the essence of some of those spiritual
principles that the fervent AA members brag about so much.

<p>
Thank you, Sir.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Zachary,
<p>
Wow. Thank you for the compliments. I hope and trust that you are doing
well now.
<p>
And yes! Quit smoking too. It really makes it all worth while.
<p>
You know that funny line that Bill Wilson used? &#8212;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension
of existence of which we had not even dreamed.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
chapter 2, <i>There Is A Solution</i>, page 25.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well quitting smoking on top of quitting the drugs and alcohol, 
and also starting to eat right, is the closest thing that I know of to that.
When you quit <i>ALL</i> of the bad stuff, the recovery is rapid, dramatic,
and intense.
<p>
It's not only worth it, but downright fun. For a while there, you
can actually watch your health improve day by day.
You feel like a superman. (Unfortunately, that great
 feeling does not stay.
You return to &quot;normalcy&quot; eventually. But it's good while it lasts.
And you never lose all of the glow. I feel ten or twenty
 times better than I used to,
even when I'm not paying any attention to how I feel.)
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	Simple Rules<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
In your response to
<a href="orange-letters149.html#tape" target="newwin49">a recent letter</a>
 from someone having a hard time stopping
drinking, you suggested two simple sayings:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. &quot;Just don't take that first drink, no matter what&quot; and
<p><li>
2. &quot;Play the tape to the end.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
I just wanted to say that both of these perspectives were of great help to me.
&quot;Just don't take that first drink, no matter what&quot; was helpful early on when I was
in the &quot;one day at a time&quot; mode.  After a few months, &quot;play the tape to the end&quot;
became more relevant.  This was basically just thinking about the ramifications of
my actions today on my future.   With respect to drinking it came down to the
question of, &quot;Will drinking today make it more difficult to not take that first
drink tomorrow?&quot;  The 'play the tape to the end' answer for me was always &quot;yes, it
will be harder to not drink tomorrow if I drink today.&quot;  So I didn't drink and
haven't for five years this month.

<p>
I also want to express my appreciation of your efforts.  So thanks!

Hello,

<p>
I found your article interesting.  When I joined AA I had similar thoughts.
My fianc&eacute; and I quit at the same time, thus I felt compelled to join the
program he joined in support for him, he felt that it was the only way to
stop drinking.

<p>
I would like to know why and where you wrote the article.  I noted the list
of references, well done, I might check them.  Was this for a college, for
fun, were you hurt by AA?  Basically what is your angle?

Hello Chancity,
<p>
To make a long story short, I went through an alcoholism
 &quot;treatment program&quot; that was funded by the city, state health
plan, and Federal government, and
was surprised and appalled to discover that cult religion was the
standard treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction. Not even good
religion, but
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin44">bone-headed illogical old cult religion</a>.

<p>
So I set out to write a paper about why it was wrong to use Alcoholics
Anonymous as a cure for drug and alcohol problems. Especially when the
taxpayers &#8212; like the Oregon Health Plan &#8212; are paying for it.
I thought the paper would be maybe 30 or 40 pages long, typed double-spaced.
Like a term paper.  The term paper got a little large as I kept adding to it.

I asked a lady with terminal cancer if she's ever heard about the disease theory of
alcoholism. She said no and asked if I could explain it to her. I began to explain
that there are people that believe alcoholism to be a chronic and progressive
disease. These same people also believe that the only way to treat it is through a
spiritual experience with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. After I explained all
this to her, she immediately and hysterically laughed! I asked, &quot;Ma'am, why are you
laughing?&quot; She responded, &quot;That is the funniest thing I have ever heard of in my
life!&quot;

<p>
After the laughter there was a brief pause and I really started to think about this
more than I ever had. I started to think about this woman's situation and how she
truly had no control whatsoever over the outcome. I began to think about how she
can't just change her actions and make her cancer go away, much like an alcoholic
can make his problems go away if he just stopped drinking. I started to think about
how companies in this country promote certain feelings as 'diseases' just to make a
profit. I started to think about how Alcoholics Anonymous did the same thing with
their program, just to increase their membership. I started to think about all the
people that claim they are victims, and all the people that truly believe they have
no control over their situation and can never do anything about it. I began to think
about the obesity problem in the United States, and how it really relates.

<p>
After reflecting for a moment about alcoholism and the disease theory, I started to
laugh! I laughed harder than I ever had in my life. It was just me and this woman,
who is dying from a 'real' disease, laughing our asses off at one of the funniest
things we've ever heard of! I'm glad I was able to put a smile on her face.

From:  	&quot;Anthony M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	The Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange,

<p>
I enjoyed reading your webpage.  I was in AA from late 2007 to late 2008, so
for roughly a year.  I always knew that I felt &quot;strange&quot; being involved with
that program.  It was difficult to explain.  I would find myself often times
saying things I didn't truly believe to appease others, and just generally
felt weird about going to meetings.  Ultimately, I knew that it was not
going to be a lifetime commitment for me, but people in the program kept
talking about the importance of staying in the program, and how if you leave
you are going to drink and your life would be miserable, and how they put AA
above their family, and all this crazy stuff.  I went to an outpatient rehab
and at first, and even they kept pushing AA on me.

<p>
So, I went for a year.  Sometime in-between, I read your webpage and I was
shocked at the level of insight that you had about AA.  It seemed like
everything you said, everywhere from the way that I was feeling to the stuff
that was going on at the meetings, was true.  If I'm recalling correctly, I
believe you spoke of
 &quot;<a href="orange-letters137.html#cognitive_dissonance" target="newwin46">cognitive dissonance</a>,&quot;
 and how a person will &quot;know&quot;
that AA is not the answer for them, but others consisently tell them that it
is, and reinforce the idea, which causes an internal dilemma.  That is
exactly how I felt.  There were other webpages that I read about where
people talked about AA being a cult and whatnot, but it wasn't until I came
across your webpage that I got real insight, and felt like someone
understood the way that I was feeling.  I felt so alone when I was involved
in AA.  I could not talk about my feelings with others because they would
dismiss them as invalid, and just keep telling me to talk to my sponsor,
work the steps, etc.  It got to the point where I was just sick of talking
to people.

<p>
No longer do I count sobriety days.  I don't even remember the day I stopped
drinking anymore; all I know was that it was sometime in late 2007.  I have
been out of AA for two years and life is so much better without it.  It
really is.  A lot of my courage to finally say &quot;enough's enough&quot; and leave
that program came from reading your webpage, and I thank you for taking the
time.  I want to let you know that you helped me by simply posting this
webpage.  Thanks.

<p>
Best,

<p>
Anthony
