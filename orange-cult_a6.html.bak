<i>The Guru Is Extra-Special.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
The two &quot;saints&quot; of Alcoholic Anonymous definitely were and
are rated as extra-special.
The A.A. true believers imagine that two broken-down mentally-ill alcoholics had
the keys to God's Kingdom, and that everything they wrote was true wisdom.

<p>
The cultish worship of Bill and Dr. Bob began so early that at the very first A.A. clubhouse
in New York City, on West Twenty-Fourth Street...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There was a picture of Bill above the fireplace with what looked like a halo
around his head. We used to kid Bill about it.<br>

<p>
Yes, it was really
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Bill_W_Movement">The
Bill W. Movement</a>&quot;</i> from the very beginning.
<p>

William G. Wilson<br>
<i>&quot;What, me get a job? You've got to be joking. It's your
job to support me, because I'm special.&quot;</i>
</center></font></td></tr></table>
<p>

William Griffith Wilson certainly considered himself extra-special &#8212;
Bill took the best of everything for himself:
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">all of the money</a>,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">all of the women</a>,
all of the praise and adulation, and
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk">all of the fame and credit</a> for
&quot;saving&quot; alcoholics, while exhorting all of the
other alcoholics to be anonymous and work selflessly.
When Bill Wilson was caught stealing the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund,
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">
stealing the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i></a>, and selling unauthorized copies
of the book,
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith">
Dr. Bob told the other members not to make a fuss about it</a>,
&quot;for the good of the fellowship&quot;.
<p>
The A.A. organization even bought Bill Wilson a Cadillac car and a big house
in the country, &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, and gave Bill enough money
that he never had to work a straight job again. The A.A. headquarters, the <i>Alcoholic
Foundation</i>, even supported Bill's mistresses and girl friends for
him &#8212; women were hired as office staff
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#two_women">because they were Bill's girlfriends</a>,
even though they could not type. Nobody else in A.A. ever got that kind
of treatment.
<p>
And whenever another scandal over Bill's philandering or drug use arose, the
other A.A. members just scurried around,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP">covering it all up</a>. Nobody else in
A.A. ever got such privileged treatment.
<p>
<a name="Rockefeller_04"> </a>

And the Seventh Tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous states that A.A. should be
forever self-supporting, declining outside contributions. All except Bill Wilson,
that is, who happily took a $120 per month stipend donated by the outsider
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., which was equivalent to $1680 per month in year 2012 dollars.
(See an inflation calculator here:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160527045107/http://www.westegg.com/inflation/" target="_blank">http://www.westegg.com/inflation/</a>.)
Heck, for that matter, the whole start of A.A. was
marked by Bill Wilson's scheming to get money from other people.
The entire creation of the <i>Big Book</i> was financed with
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">funds fraudulently obtained</a> from others
in what basically amounts to
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock3">a stock swindle</a>.

<p>
At the same time, many A.A. members actually believe that Bill Wilson was
guided by God and instructed by God when he wrote the opening chapters of
the <i>Big Book</i> <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>. They imagine that Bill
was some kind of a spiritual teacher whose role it was to lead people to
God. And they imagine that Bill's words embody some kind of indisputable wisdom.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If Bill said it, then it's true. Period. Bill has the answers to
everything.&quot;</font>
The true believers will not question the validity of Bill's statements
in his books, even when they are blatantly false, contradictory,
irrational, grossly unrealistic, and obviously insane.
<p>

The current leadership of Alcoholics Anonymous considers Bill's words to be
so special that when they released the fourth edition of the <i>Big Book</i>,
they did not change a single word, or fix a single falsehood, in the sacred <i>First
164 Pages</i>, which Bill mostly wrote or co-wrote. (But they did delete
Clarence Snyder's story, <i>The Home Brewmeister</i>.
Clarence Snyder was the one and only person in the <i>Big Book</i>
who criticized Bill Wilson for his financial dishonesty. Now there are none.)
<p>
Likewise, the other cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith,
is also considered a prophet and a saint of the church.
The true believers pointedly overlook the fact that
Dr. Bob was such a religious fanatic that he wrote in the Big Book that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Bob_sorry4you">he
felt sorry for you</a> if you don't swallow all of the dogmatic religious statements
that he and Bill Wilson were selling in the <i>Big Book</i>.
Dr. Bob's daughter wrote in her own book that Dr. Bob was a cold, cruel, aloof, harsh
alcoholic father,
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#child_abuse">someone who carved a paddle
with which to beat his children, modifying it so that it would hurt more</a>.
Dr. Bob was a textbook case of a petty tyrant, someone who grovelled
like a toady before his superiors, like his wife (read <i>Dr. Bob's Nightmare</i>
in the <i>Big Book</i>), but who was an autocratic dictator to those who
were weaker than him, like his children or sick alcoholics.
The faithful A.A. members also overlook the fact that Dr. Bob was so
wrecked and had such
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#bet_your_ass">a bad reputation as a doctor</a>
from his many years of being a drunk doctor, that
he was incapable of even supporting himself while working as a doctor, and
had to be supported by an A.A. handout for the rest of his life while he devoted his
life to cult religion.

<p>
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were the only people who ever got
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">royalties</a>
from the publication of the <i>Big Book</i> even though the book had at
least 32 authors,
and those authors had been promised that the group would own the book
&#8212; everybody else was supposed to be &quot;unselfish&quot; and have
&quot;no thought of the profit motive.&quot;
Bill Wilson even had the gall to brag:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To be vital, faith must be accompanied by self sacrifice
and unselfish, constructive action.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 7,
<i>Working With Others</i>, page 93.</font>

<p>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The unselfishness of these men as we have come to know
them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their community
spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who has labored
long and wearily in this alcoholic field.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">

<i>The Doctor's Opinion</i>, page XXV.</font>
<p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In spite of all of that, the A.A. true believers still imagine that Bill Wilson
and Doctor Bob were special people.

<i>Flexible, shifting morality</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 5.<br>
<p>
The early members really exhibited the Double Standard regarding Bill Wilson.
Whenever he committed crimes or sins, members just ignored it and covered it up for him.
<p>
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith">Doctor Bob told the other members
not to make a fuss</a>, &quot;for the good of
the fellowship&quot;, when Bill Wilson stole the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund
and the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i>, and then
sold unauthorized and uncopyrighted multilith copies of the book
(which invalidated any possible future copyright).
<p>

<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">
When Bill philandered and thirteenth-stepped the pretty women</a> who came
to the A.A. meetings, the other members just covered it up.
They just looked the other way when Bill Wilson acted as a sexual predator
and took advantage of the young women who came to A.A. to try to achieve sobriety.
Behavior that would have been considered grossly immoral if done by anyone else
was just rationalized away when Bill Wilson did it. The other A.A. members
didn't see any conflict between Bill's behavior and his constant demands that everyone
else adhere to the highest standards of &quot;spirituality&quot;,
&quot;absolute purity&quot;, &quot;absolute unselfishness&quot;, &quot;absolute love&quot;,
and &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;.
<p>
<a name="deceive_people"> </a>
Even today, A.A. members also exhibit flexible morality in their treatement of
prospective new recruits:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
People who would consider it a serious moral wrong to deceive people,
or withhold vital medical information from people, or deliberately give
them false information in critical life-or-death matters, do not consider
it to be morally wrong to do that to newcomers to Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p><li>
Ordinarily, lying and deceit would be considered bad, a violation of
the &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; that the A.A. program supposedly demands,
but A.A. routinely practices deceptive recruiting and coercive recruiting,
and rationalizes it by saying that A.A. is
&quot;<a href="orange-letters4.html#forced_help">forcing them to get help</a>&quot;,
and &quot;doing it for their own good.&quot;
<p><li>
In the
<a href="orange-recruit.html"><i>Big Book</i> recruiting manual</a>,
Bill Wilson even taught the A.A. recruiters to dole out the real truth
about Alcoholics Anonymous to the prospective new members only
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons">by teaspoons,
rather than by buckets</a>&quot;.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters173.html#horror4" target="_blank">
'Okay, so now I tell my &quot;sponsor&quot; about what happened. Her response was
&quot;there was a womanizer in the meetings that she was from. Even though he
did those things to those women, he still carried a great message.&quot; Oh my god.'</a>

</ul>

<p>
And even today, the national headquarters of A.A. displays flexible, shifting
standards of morality.
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">
They have committed perjury in the courts of Mexico
and Germany</a> to enforce non-existent copyrights on old versions of the <i>Big Book</i>,
and put poor A.A. members in prison for the crime of trying to help other poor
alcoholics. That is hardly &quot;absolute honesty&quot; or &quot;absolute purity&quot;.

<p>
The reason for the 5 rating, rather than a 10, is because I can't really
condemn all A.A. members as morally crippled. Some are more cultish than others;
some are sicker than others.


<p><br><font size="+2"><b>
<a name="ca_separatism"> </a>
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_separatism">63</a>.
<i>Separatism</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores an 5.<br>
<p>

Rather than healing people and returning them to normal life in the mainstream of
society, like real doctors do, A.A. has the goal of keeping people coming back to A.A. meetings
for the rest of their lives. You never recover, so you have to <i>Keep Coming Back</i>.
The goal of 12-Step-based &quot;treatment&quot; is not to heal people
and end the treatment; it is to addict the patient to the treatment so
that he will spend the rest of his life in a 12-Step group like
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.
<p>
While other cults may isolate their members in &quot;temples&quot;, or ashrams, or communes,
A.A. and N.A. isolate their members in &quot;half-way houses&quot;, and &quot;clean and sober homes&quot; or &quot;treatment centers&quot;,
where everybody is a member of a 12-Step group, and they all go to
12-Step  meetings together several times a week.
<p>

Too many A.A. members have a tendency to only want to socialize with
other A.A. members, rather than integrating themselves back into general society.
They defend such social isolation by claiming that it separates them from sources
of temptation or embarassment. Unfortunately, it also separates them from sources
of common sense, or any other viewpoints than that of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
John Bradshaw says that people in the Codependency and Adult Children of Alcoholics
cults should reject their own families and other people who are not &quot;in recovery&quot;,
and limit their social contacts to &quot;people who will support you&quot;,
that is, other 12-Step cult members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If your family of origin is not in recovery, it is almost impossible
to get support from them while you're in your own recovery process.
Often they think that what you're doing is stupid and they shame you for it.
Often they are threatened by your doing this work, because as you
give up your old family roles, you disrupt the frozen equilibrium of the
family system.
You were never allowed to be yourself before.
Why would they suddenly start allowing that now?
If your family of origin was dysfunctional, it is the least likely place
to get your nurturing needs met. So, I advise you to keep a safe distance
and work on finding a new, nonshaming supportive family.
This could be a support group of friends, it could be the group you
joined to work on your inner child, or it could be any one of the
myriad 12-Step groups now available all over the country.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Homecoming</i>, John Bradshaw, page 209.

</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Your real family is reduced to being only &quot;your family of origin&quot;. The
cult is of course your new family now.
And your old family is so bad that you just shouldn't have anything to do with
them any more.

<p>
Oh yeh? Says who? How could the author know that?
The author just assumes that the birth family is bad for their offspring,
without knowing anything about the family.
How casually the author advocates breaking up families.
The author assumes that the family will resist or resent their child changing for
the better.
The author assumes that the child's personality changes will be for the better
 as the cult indoctrinates the child.  But what if the author's real fear is
that the family will resist their child mindlessly babbling nonsensical
cult propaganda like what we see in this paragraph?
<p>
The author says that the family will be upset
<font color="black">
&quot;as you give up your old family roles, you disrupt the frozen equilibrium of the family system.&quot;</font>
That is delusional. Who says that the family is &quot;stuck in a frozen equilibrium&quot;?
Who says that the family is attached to the child's &quot;old family roles&quot;?
That entire paragraph is just grossly unrealistic cult dogma that merely assumes
that the family is will resist the new cult recruit changing.

<p>
<!--
The family that for years begged for their child to not drink or drug so much, and
&quot;please quit harming yourself&quot;, is suddently too dense and ignorant to
understand recovery?  They will think that recovery is &quot;stupid&quot;
or &quot;shameful&quot;? Says who? Where does the author get that?
<P>
And this author Mr. Bradshaw says that the family will feel &quot;threatened&quot; by
their child no longer killing himself with drugs and alcohol? How could they
possibly feel threatened by that? The author says that the family will be upset
<font color="black">
&quot;as you give up your old family roles, you disrupt the frozen equilibrium of the family system.&quot;</font>
That is delusional. Who says that the family is &quot;stuck in a frozen equilibrium&quot;?
Who says that the family is attached to the addict's &quot;old family roles&quot;?
Since when are drinking and drugging too much &quot;family roles&quot; that the family will
resist their child changing?
That entire paragraph is just grossly unrealistic cult dogma.
<P>
The sad irony there is that it is often the family that pays for &quot;rehab&quot; in a 12-Step
&quot;treatment center&quot;, because they want their child to live.
They pay tens of thousands of dollars for &quot;treatment&quot; of their child, and 
what they get for their money is a bunch of dogmatic cult members teaching their
child that the &quot;family of origin&quot; is bad for him.
-->

There we see an extreme example of
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_enemy" target="_blank">devaluation of outsiders</a>,
which is another standard cult characteristic that A.A. strongly exemplifies.
<p>
And mind you, this &quot;advice&quot; is for people who are Adult Children of Alcoholics, or
people who supposedly suffer from &quot;Codependency&quot;, both of which are imaginary diseases
that don't even exist, and which will not be cured by 12-Step religion.

<a href="orange-letters424.html#Andres_T" target="_blank">
A recent letter to the Orange Papers</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In at least one occasion he [the sponsor] even got annoyed because I was putting my mother first and not other people within the fellowship. Not only my sponsor wanted such things. Another long standing member of the fellowship was giving me similar advice but his was worst. He wanted me to quit my job, ask my brother to take care of my mother and try to cut contact with her to as minimum as possible.  According to him keeping in touch with my mother would lead to codependency which is for him another form of addiction that is also treated used the 12 Steps program. This advice was received after having met him only 20 minutes earlier.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="orange-letters108.html#horror" target="_blank">Another letter said</a>,

<blockquote>

<p>
The Alcoholics Anonymous <i>Big Book</i> even says that A.A. comes before family,

I MET BILL W.
</center>
<p>
One of the most important events that happened to me in 1947, when my emotions
were so unpredictable, was the day I met Bill W. for the first time.
Bill W. as you may know was one of the co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous.
One evening the chairman of our Saturday night meeting announced that Bill
was coming to Boston for a weekend. He said Bill would be staying at one of
the larger hotels and would have his suite open for
visitors during certain hours. I made sure I was there.
<p>
That Saturday afternoon there were over two hundred people waiting to see Bill
when I arrived. To accomodate the number of visitors, the leaders
created groups of fifteen people and gave each group a twenty minute time
period to visit with Bill. I was in the fourth group and it proved to be worth
the two hour wait.
<p>
We were ushered into a lounge that was large enough to accomodate the fifteen
of us comfortably. There were four medium-sized sofas and six overstuffed
chairs to sit in. Bill was sitting in one of the chairs facing the door when
I first saw him. He was dressed in a modest brown suit, white shirt, and brown
striped tie. Even his shoes and socks were brown. He stood up to shake our hands
as we walked in and to me he looked to be about six feet tall. I could see that
he was slender and well-built. His handshake was firm and warm.
<p>
However, it wasn't his physical appearance that impressed me as much as it was
the spiritual aura that seemed to permeate the whole room. Bill seemed to be
unaware of the phenomenon and even of his part in it, but to me it was
real yet unnatural. I was so awed by his presence that to this day I can't tell
you what we talked about, but I will never forget the feeling. I wasn't alone
in that either. It was not just my youthful impressionability; other men older
than I had felt it too.
<p>
When I walked away from Bill that day I knew I had been in the presence of some
spiritual force. The strange warm feeling I took away from that encounter
lasted for several days. I had the privilege of repeating that experience
once again a year later and I had exactly the same reaction to him then
as I did the first time. I would have moved to New York just to be near him
if I could have.<br>

Bill Wilson harped endlessly about &quot;selfishness&quot;,
&quot;self-centeredness&quot;, &quot;self-seeking&quot;,

and that we must get rid of it and become obedient little slaves of his

Whatever our protestations, are not most of us concerned with ourselves,
our resentments, or our self-pity?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Selfishness &#8212; self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root
of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion,
self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows
and they retaliate. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making.
They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme
example of self-will run riot, though
he usually doesn't think so.
Above everything, we alcoholics <font color="#9F0000">must</font>
be rid of this selfishness.

God makes that possible. And there often seems no way of entirely

So quit trying to run your own life and take care of yourself,
which Bill Wilson called &quot;<a href="#Director_God">playing God</a>&quot;.

<p>
And then there is Bill Wilson's masochistic, narcissistic grovelling before God,
declaring that we must all be entirely rid of &quot;self&quot;:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our
Maker, <i>as we understood Him</i>: &quot;God, I offer myself to
Thee &#8212; to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy
will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may
bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love,
and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!&quot; We thought
well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that
we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
A.A. co-founder Doctor Bob also declared that his alcoholism was caused by selfishness:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unfortunately for me I was the only child, which perhaps engendered the
selfishness which played such an important part in bringing on my
alcoholism.<br>

<p>
And, of course, Bill Wilson's solution to the problem of selfishness
was to get everybody working &quot;selflessly&quot; to
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">go recruit
more A.A. members</a>.

<p>
A currently-popular A.A. booster, Wayne B., declares:
<blockquote>

...if a person wants what AA has, and is willing to go to any
lengths to get it, then one is ready to take certain steps.  Ok, but
what is the &quot;it&quot; AA has to offer a still sick and suffering

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Bill Wilson repeated
the idea that you cannot trust your own mind, and must have your
sponsor censor your thinking, in
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, where he stated
that in both confessing our moral wrongs and in receiving
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">Guidance from God</a>,
we cannot trust our own thinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... if all our lives we had more or less
fooled ourselves, how
could we now be so sure that we weren't still self-deceived?
How could we be certain we had made a true catalog of our
defects and had really admitted them, even to ourselves?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... what comes to us alone may be garbled by our own rationalization and wishful
thinking. The benefit of talking to another person is that
we can get his direct comment and counsel on our situation, and there
can be no doubt in our minds what that advice is.
Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
How many times have we heard well-intentioned people claim the
guidance of God when it was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken.
Lacking both practice and humility, they had deluded themselves and
were able to justify the most arrant nonsense on the ground
that this was what God had told them.
It is worth noting that people of very high spiritual
development almost always insist on checking with friends or spiritual
advisors the guidance they feel they have received from God.
Surely, then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
While the comment or advice of others is by no means infallible, it
is likely to be far more specific than any direct
guidance we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in
establishing contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>

<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 59-60.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, you are supposed to sit quietly in Step Eleven, and wait
for God to talk to you and give you your orders, then you should
humbly assume that you got it all wrong and completely misunderstood
God when he gave you your
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">Guidance</a>, because
you are only a novice who is inexperienced in talking with God,
so you should then let your sponsor and the A.A. group
correct your thinking, and tell you what to do,
what to think, and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">what to believe</a>.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Also note Bill Wilson's arrogant assumption that none of the newcomer
alcoholics have had any prior experience in making contact with God.
Their spiritual and religious lives were a total blank until Bill Wilson
told them to pray and meditate and believe.
In Bill Wilson's deranged mind, everybody was an atheistic alcoholic (or an alcoholic atheist)
until Bill the Prophet set them on the right path by telling them what to do and what to think.

<li> &quot;You should feel Serenity and Gratitude.&quot;
<li> &quot;Alcoholics can't afford to have resentments.&quot;

<li> &quot;All you need to start a meeting is a pot of coffee and a resentment.&quot;

<p>
And then there is
<a href="#freedom2think">Bill Wilson's outrageous declaration</a> that you do not
even have <i>the right</i> to think for yourself:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
How persistently we claim the right to
decide all by ourselves just what we shall think and just how we shall
act. &nbsp; ...how well does it actually work?
One good look in the mirror ought to be answer enough for any
alcoholic.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 37.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson declared that you must quit trying to manage your own life and
take care of yourself &#8212; which Bill called &quot;playing God&quot;.
Bill insisted that you must let a dictator run your life:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
First of all, we had to quit <font color="#9F0000">playing God</font>.
It didn't work. Next, we
decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our
Director. He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are
His children.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, &quot;How It Works&quot;, page 62.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently live in
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil">a new and wonderful world</a>,
no matter what your present circumstances!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 100.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The &quot;Higher Power&quot; dictator is ostensibly supposed to be
&quot;God&quot; but again, the dictator &quot;G.O.D.&quot; might just be
your A.A. &quot;<b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>runks&quot;, or your sponsor, or
<a href="orange-heresy.html#bedpan">any Golden Calf</a> of your choosing.
<p>
<font color="blue">
If you want to give a political label to that program, it is called
&quot;fascism&quot;, where you are reduced
to being just a faithful obedient slave of <i>Der F&uuml;hrer</i>.
(It also somewhat resembles &quot;Communism&quot;, where you are reduced to
being the obedient slave of a Fearless Leader, but A.A. lacks
the communal property aspect of Communism.)
</font>

<p>
And A.A. takes over the newcomer's decision-making process again in Step Eleven:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So you practice Step Eleven, and listen for God to dictate some orders to you.
But then you have to
<a href="#receive_guidance"><i>check your Guidance</i></a>
with your sponsor or other group elders, and seek their approval,
to make sure that you heard God correctly.
As mentioned above, Bill Wilson declared that
<a href="#receive_guidance">you could not trust your own mind</a>, or your own
received Guidance, because you may well be deceiving yourself again:
<p>
<a name="self_deceived"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If all our lives we had more or less fooled ourselves, how could we
now be so sure that we weren't still self-deceived?
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 59-60.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So your sponsor or the group elders will be the ones
who actually decide what God is really saying to you. They will really be
the ones who are telling you what to do, and making the decisions.
They get to speak to you as the voice of God.

<p>
Which leaves the giant question: Who bossed Bill Wilson around for
his own good, and told <i>him</i> what to think and what to do?
Nobody that I can see. That's
<a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_guru_bosses">another standard cult characteristic</a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>Everybody else needs the guru to boss him around, but nobody
bosses the guru around.</b>

<i>You owe everything to the group. The group says that it made you what
you are, and gave you everything that you have, so now you are obligated to
the group.</i><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
First off, A.A. obviously claims that it and Bill Wilson's 12-step program
made you quit drinking and saved your life, and gave you &quot;spirituality&quot;,
so you are obligated to go recruiting for A.A. for the rest of your life so that you
can similarly &quot;save&quot; others, and make them into good A.A. members, too.
Likewise, you are obligated to <i>keep coming back</i> to meetings forever,
if not for your own sake, then for the sake of the newcomers.
<p>
In A.A., you are not allowed to claim that you quit drinking by yourself, or that you used your
own will power and intelligence to save your own life; you must &quot;admit&quot; that
you are powerless over alcohol, that your situation before quitting was hopeless,
and that only A.A. and God could have saved you.
So you owe them your life:
<blockquote>
