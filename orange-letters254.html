Fascinating!!!!!!! We can justify anything,, I bet you were once in A.A. and didn't
make it so now your bitter and have sought other methods that better suited your
life style &#8212;  I couldn't afford those places and or treatments because I was broke
due to drinking!!!!
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Rodney,
<p>
That is a really lame attempt to explain away information that disturbs your favorite
superstitions.
<p>
The truth is, I quit drinking two weeks before I went to A.A., and I have 10 years of sobriety now.
I also have 10 years off of drugs and cigarettes. I just quit everything at once by using self-reliance
and my own intelligence and will power. And my determination not to die that way.
<p>
I went to A.A. and N.A. meetings for a short while, about 3 months, and then rejected them as just another
cult religion.
<p>
I did get a so-called &quot;treatment program&quot;, paid for by the Oregon Health Plan. That is where I learned
that quackery and cult religion were being sold as a cure for drug and alcohol problems.
That story is
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

</font>
<p>
 Yes a scum buckett,,,, I WAS,,, Well, my suggestion is to hurry
up and get all this help to those that need it,, because the court system and
Hospitals still send them (hurting people ) to A.A./ I bet those DOCTORS you pointed
out,, are keeping it to themselves or they are selling it to the highest bidder or
to Insurance Companies,,,
<p>
<font color="blue">
Doctors keeping what to themselves? What are you talking about?
</font>
<p>

 Now thats a mockery,,Regardless the Dollar Occult is still
out there while others with The Truth,,lol,, stay quite ,,You know I once heard that
those that do nothing usually find Fault with those that do something!!!!!!! Just
saying- Keep up the Good Work-Fault finding is really hard
work...NOTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm fumilure

<p>
<font color="blue">
Rodney, I both find fault with quack cures and suggest better alternatives.

<p>
Thanks Terrance for a great letter.  On the genetic thing.  On re-reading
my letter I did come across as anti-genetic research being done on alcohol
dependency.  I did not mean that.  All research for its own sake broadens
knowledge.  It is just that when it comes to the brain and genetics we are
about in the 13th century as regards to its effective non destructive
application.  In  Spain during this time doctors were called 'mata sanos'
which means killers of the healthy .... and until whatever genes or
combination thereof once isolated are fully understood .... policies
regarding what to do with this new knowledge are best NOT MADE.

Have a great day

Hello Unnamed,
<p>
No worries. I was not referring to you when I talked about some people denying the genetic link to alcoholism.
I was referring to the doctors and other authority figures who vehemently deny that there is
any genetic component to alcoholism. As I said, that is a hotly debated topic.
 There are some people who have published very strident
articles that insist that we have been looking for an alcoholism gene for 50 years now and
have never found anything, so the genetic theory is thoroughly disproved.
<p>
No it isn't:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h3>A Functional Neuropeptide Y Leu7Pro Polymorphism Associated
With Alcohol Dependence in a Large Population Sample From the United
States</h3>
...
<br>
This is only the second specific
genetic mechanism ever identified that modulates risk for alcohol
dependence.<br>
(See: <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>. 2002;59:825-831;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html">

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
James Christopher's book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS" target="_blank"><i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-Step Programs</i></a>
contains an interview with Dr. Kenneth Blum, who discovered the first gene that is
linked to alcoholism.

<p>
Now some people who wish to believe that there is no genetic component to alcoholism try to
dismiss their research as flawed, so the debate is still going on, hot and heavy.
I hope that the newly-decoded human genome will give further hints and evidence.
We will get it all figured out eventually.

<p>
Have a good day now.

P.S.: And then something else came to mind: The alcoholic monkeys in this video:
Alcoholic Vervet Monkeys<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSm7BcQHWXk" target="newwin29">
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSm7BcQHWXk</a>
<p>
That monkey population has the same percentages of alcoholics and tea-totalers as humans do,
which strongly suggests a genetic factor that is common to everything from those monkeys to us.
There is no way to argue that those monkeys and humans have the same
environments, society, or childhood upbringing.
<p>
(So why don't more monkeys become alcoholics? Because they can't get a steady supply of alcohol.)

Subject:  	Mind Blowing<br>

<p>
I'm absolutely blown away by the amount of data and documentation you
have gathered and assembled and made freely distributable.  Its amazing.

<p>
I quit AA 3 1/2 years ago.  I figured out much of what you have figured
out.  I started complaining about being tired of the lies, and then some
members pointed me to you and accused me of mimicking you... like I'm
not capable of figuring out the lies after 16 years.  I kept looking
around at others with the same amount of time and I realized they were
abusing their status in AA, and they were not happy with me because I
was not following in their and other's footsteps.

<p>
Screw them.  When I decided to quit, I had nice young lady who had less
than a year tell me she was really mad at me because she loved my
message and I have so much time that I'm taking away from the program
that she needs... she told me that RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY WIFE when we
went out to eat and she was our waitress!!!

<p>
Amazing what a brain washing operation AA is.  I have no desire to be
involved in that crap anymore.  Prison Yard / Psych Ward / Control Freak
Fest assembly.  I'm actually ashamed I forced myself to go there for so
long knowing in the back of my mind what kind of sick crap goes on
there.  It hurt me quite a bit I think.  Yea, I'm grateful for my
sobriety, but I'm really ashamed I was in that organization.  Every guru
I met had some kind of sick crap they were doing in there.

<p>
One lady I met, a real guru, had been sponsored by one of the first
100.  She was 20 years my senior and she kept grabbing my ass every
chance she could get (without anyone noticing).  What the hell?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Patrick,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
And congratulations on your newfound freedom, and also for your sobriety, in all meanings of the word.

<p>
The story about the young lady who was so upset at you rejecting A.A. because it deprived her
of the &quot;message&quot; that she loved is so revealing, isn't it?
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
 &quot;Don't bother me with the facts; I don't want to hear the truth;
I have my comforting fairy tales, and I don't want to lose my belief in them.&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
About the other old-timers, that just seems to come with the territory, doesn't it?
It's really funny how both Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson managed to sell the idea that if you 
gather a bunch of sinners and degenerates and sick people  and mentally ill people
and criminals and alcoholics together in a room,
and have them do some cultish practices, you will eventually get a bunch of saints.
(Even though Bill wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> &quot;We are not saints.&quot; Yes,
but he also wrote, &quot;Progress, not perfection,&quot; which implies that A.A. members progress
towards perfection, and eventually <i>The Promises</i> will come true.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

hi terrence
<p>
 thanks for your reply to my letter regarding the publishing of a
book i dont blame you for wanting to hit the beach instead of the computer
i,m not very good with computers myself i,m still on vacation at the moment
but when i return to my town i intend to print some flyers with the website
addresses of alternatives to the 12 step cults including your own website
its been quite amazing since i left cult and got my brain out of hock i,m
starting to realise the true extent of my own personal power and act upon
it.
<p>
i will be entering the dens of AA when i get home and handing out flyers to
the newcomers theres no point in trying to reason with the old timers their
brains are addled with wilsonite doctrine the new methods of stopping
drinking seem to be about empowering people to take control of their lives
and actions and to put people in touch with their own personal power it
makes sense.

From:  	&quot;Mikhail S&quot;<br>
Subject:  	What is A.A.'s goal? What is your goal?<br>

<p>
Hi Orange.

<p>
I have been sober for 11 months now. Was going to A.A. meetings and at some stage
was very passionate about the 12 Step program. Was thorough and honest and was often
invited to give speeches about miracles of the Program to those, who are less
enthusiastic in their journey through 12 Steps. I am used to be a living example of
&quot;working the steps&quot;.

<p>
Everything changed for me when I started to carry &quot;this&quot; message in Step 12 last
month. I've got a nice and pretty female sponsee (or she got me). And a difficult
one. She was asking many difficult questions. I did not like her desire to know
everything BEFORE working the steps. And at the same time, did not feel right to
simply ignore her legitimate questions.

<p>
My sponsor, who has been in A.A. for forty (40!) years told me to say to my sponsee:
&quot;SHUT THE F@#K UP!&quot;.  I must say, it was quite a discovery for me, since I was
convinced that I should not be ashamed of standing together with God and carry His
message.

<p>
Very soon I felt that when I carry &quot;the message&quot;, I do not believe myself. What I
say is &quot;right&quot;, according to the Big Book and A.A., I say the same things I was
told, but I simply felt there was something terribly wrong with it. I started to
doubt if what I was doing was right.

<p>
On 24 July 2011, early morning, I asked myself a question: &quot;What actually happened
first? I sobered up, or worked the Steps?&quot;. I did not like the answer, but &#8212; it was
ME who stopped drinking and smoking (after 15 years of doing both). I simply &quot;was
swallowing my fist&quot; in the times when it was hard and did not take a drink or a
cigarette no matter what...

<p>
I felt disturbed and cheated: A.A. was taking &quot;credit&quot; for my sobriety. Also &#8212; I was
looking for help with alcohol and instead obtained membership in a cult.

<p>
When I discussed it with my sponsor (for the purpose of solving this inner conflict
and getting back to my comfort zone), the guy who probably remembers A.A. being
formed, answered: &quot;I can debate about anything, but I am not prepared to debate
about A.A. or the Steps &#8212; the most beautiful program in the World&quot;. Also that I can
go and drink, that I will crawl back... That I hurt him... Asking about what
happened to me, since I was working the Steps thoroughly etc.... And also  &#8212; he
asked me to keep away from meetings, so I can't harm anyone with my evil thoughts.
(I did not &quot;understand it&quot;, since &quot;the only requirement for membership is a desire
to stop drinking&quot;. In fact &#8212; I don't even have to call myself(or be) an alcoholic).

<p>
Thanks  to my sponsor, by his actions, he confirmed everything I did not want to
believe in: A.A. is a religious sect, open-mindedness does not exist there...

<p>
I found your Web-Site and... Well, thanks, you made a big job and put so many
thoughts together.

<p>
I do not like to turn around 180&deg; when actually things are working fine. I still go
to meetings.  Nowadays, I sit in my group of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have no
bloody clue what for. I see a bunch of very nice men and women who with sincere
interest discuss fairy tales. Well, having delusional aims and living in delusion,
unfortunately leads to quite a real fall. And the pain from the fall is quite real
as well.

<p>
I have stopped carrying the message, but my sponsee, told me a couple of days ago,
that she feels that A.A. is a sect! Thank you, my dear... And what could I tell her?
&quot;Yes, it is!&quot;.

<p>
I speak to many people from A.A. about it. I carry my &quot;evil&quot; message. In the form of
questions. The same ones I was asking myself. I feel like doing it BUT, I am
confused with some issues:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1) Why do I need to enlight A.A. members (by carrying MY message)? Is it not nicer
to let people live in a happy delusional reality?
<li>
2) Why do you &quot;spoil the fun&quot; for Alcoholics Anonymous? You are very harsh
(sometimes, I think, too much. Also, some critisism of yours towards A.A. can also
be applied to mainstream religions. To accuse religion or A.A. in irrationalism is
like to accuse water in being wet). So, Orange, WHAT is YOUR GOAL (purpose, aim)???
<li>
3) What is the REAL purpose of A.A.??? Is there a purpose besides pumping money from
&quot;poor&quot; alcoholics?
</ul>

<p>
What do you think?

<p>
Regards,<br>
Mikhail

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mikhail,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and a bunch of great questions. And thank you for your pursuit of
the truth.

<p>
Well, let's see if I can answer those questions.

<ol>
<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

That's a great question, one that reaches to the very core of life.
<p>
First off, A.A. doesn't really give people a happy delusion. For every person who finds A.A. to
be a happy fairy tale, 19 others grow disappointed and leave. Unfortunately, before they leave,
they get taught that to leave A.A. is to relapse and die drunk in a gutter.
And many make that a self-fulfilling prediction.
And since they have also been taught that they are powerless over alcohol, some don't think they
have any choice in the matter. The misinformation of A.A. takes its toll.

<p>
Then there are the people who get told not to take their medications, and end up in the hospital or
dying. Then there are the girls who get sexually exploited. A.A. isn't really such a happy fairy tale.
And then there are the people like you and your sponsee who get told to stop looking for the truth.
&quot;SHUT THE F@#K UP!&quot;

<p>
Then there are all of the people who hear each meeting start with Bill Wilson's lie:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;
</font><br>
Many of the beginners think that A.A. actually works, and has a working program for sobriety. They don't
realize that they are being sold an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties, and that
it is all a big hoax.
It really isn't fair to do that to them.
They deserve the truth.
Foisting ineffective quack medicine on sick people and lying to them about how well it works is
really a despicable crime.

<p>
Then there is the whole question of the meaning of life. Is the real purpose of life to just enjoy
a comforting fairy tale until you die?
If you believe in any kind of spirituality, then the answer to that
question has to be &quot;No.&quot; Like Jesus said,
&quot;Learn the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&quot;
<p>
On the other hand, if you think that just whiling away your time happily deluded is an
okay thing to do with your short, precious life, then why not just stay drunk
and stoned all of the time? That is pretty much the same thing.

<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Why do you &quot;spoil the fun&quot; for Alcoholics Anonymous? You are very harsh

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is really the same question as question number one.
And the answer is the same. &quot;Spoiling the fun&quot; by telling the truth is not a bad thing.
<p>
Yes, most religions can be criticized for being irrational. But most religions don't pass
themselves off as a magical cure for alcoholism and drug addiction.
(I know, some do, I said <i>most</i>.)

<p>
Then you tacked on another question: What is my goal? My goal is to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth. I believe that if people know the truth about
A.A., alcoholism, recovery &#8212; the whole big thing &#8212;  that it will help them.
<p>
A few true believers may be disturbed by hearing the truth shattering their cherished illusions,
but most people will benefit from the truth.

<p>
Ah, now this is a complicated question. Alcoholics Anonymous is different things to different

And many of the people at the bottom are in it because they are true believers
and they love their comforting fairy tale and their guaranteed ticket to salvation,
and the feeling of being special, &quot;in with the in-crowd&quot;, just the same
as any other cult.
<p><li>
Other people are old-timers with a lot of <i>Time</i> and status, and they
get a lot of respect and admiration from the youngsters, and they don't want to lose
that &#8212;  they don't get it anywhere else.
<p><li>
Other people sincerely want to quit drinking and recover, and they have been lied to and fooled
into thinking that A.A. actually has a working program for sobriety.

<p><li> There are many more reasons.

<p>
I am just wondering where you get your information from.  I find it really
interesting since I have read some of the work on the onerecovery website.
Please let me know.  I would really like to know of the reference material
this is based on.

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Kat

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kat,
<p>
Thanks for the question. My first source of information was, and still is, the official
A.A. publications themselves, like the <i>Big Book</i>, and 12X12, and <i>PASS IT ON</i>,
and &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Bob and the Good Old-Timers&quot;
and stuff like that.
<p>
And then sometimes, on some rare lucky occasions, some anonymous mouse sends me a goody like the
A.A. internal document that I just got that talked about the problem of sexual exploitation
of underage girls and women in A.A. groups,
<a href="orange-letters253.html#A_Nony_Mouse" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
And then a zillion other history books, and books about cults, and books about human psychology,
and recovery, and addiction and alcoholism, and on and on...
See
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">the bibliography, here</a>.

<p>
Then I use the local public libraries heavily, and also the local medical school library.
I also use their databases and catalogs and indices.
I described how I do that
<a href="orange-letters209.html#Worldcat" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters215.html#Worldcat" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
I also do searches using my public library's access to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://search.epnet.com/" target="_blank">EBSCO</a>
and other periodicals databases.
Many of the best articles on these subjects
are not directly accessible on the
Internet (via a search engine like Google or Lycos);
you have to go through a database like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://search.epnet.com/" target="_blank">EBSCO</a>
or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://www.elibrary.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Electric Library</i></a>
to get them (free).

<p>
And then of course I use the Internet. 
Wikipedia isn't very useful though, because the A.A. true believers delete any disturbing
information within minutes of it being posted.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
That's a new one.  It's the first time that I've seen an admission like
this that 13th stepping constitutes sexual harassment as opposed to just
women using AA meetings to find dates (though I have no doubt that
occurs as well).  If anything will bring down AA, I think this is what will.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, John,
<p>
Well it would be nice if that brought down A.A., or at least ended the coercive recruiting
for A.A., but I kind of doubt it. A.A. has more tenacity, and
is harder to wipe out, than a colony of cockroaches.
A.A. has survived so many &quot;crises&quot; for so long that I think it will take more than
a sex scandal to end it.
<p>
But one can hope.
<p>
At the very least, the growing public awareness of what A.A. really is, is slowly taking the
shine off of A.A.'s stellar reputation.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hey Orange:

<p>
While I have no doubt that the AA Organization is strong and will try to
combat these &quot;isolated&quot; 13th steppers, I think it will be just about as
successful as the Catholic church trying to combat the &quot;isolated&quot; chomo
priests.  Legally, they may get off (no pun intended) but the public
relations will be a nightmare.  Which is kinda sad, actually, since it
will ignore the voodoo science that they have been based on.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, John,
<p>
Indeed. Talking about the sexual abuse in A.A. doesn't even mention the quackery or
ineffectiveness of using an old Nazi cult religion as a treatment program for addictions.
<p>
But maybe, just maybe, the truth will out eventually.

Have a good day now.

This is exactly what fundamentalist AA in Miami did when people attempted

because it was in a bad part of town on Sunday morning.

I'm glad there weren't more atheist/agnostic meetings, it makes all the other things
wrong with AA less obvious.

Hello again Ray,
<p>
It's good to hear from you. Perhaps your experience in Miami was not just a coincidence.
For a few years, legal things were getting to be too hot for Mike Quinones
in Washington DC &#8212; the cops were asking a lot of questions about
the statutory rape of underage girls, and where all the money was
going &#8212; so Mike moved part of his gang to Miami, Florida,
and set up the southern branch of his cult there. It is quite possible that
you were not seeing copies of the Midtown Group, or look-alikes, you
were seeing the actual Beast itself.

I did not notice on the orange papers anything talking about the reason
they called it the Big Book. Perhaps it is there somewhere and sorry if I
missed  it. I posted this on the X-steppers forum. Feel free to edit and add to
your  site it you would like.

<center><h3>Why We Call It The Big  Book</h3></center>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A printer in Cornwall, NY, named Edward
Blackwell, had been highly recommended to Bill Wilson. Blackwell was the
President of Cornwall Press. So Bill and Hank Parkhurst (author of the personal
story &quot;The Unbeliever&quot; in the first edition of the Big Book) went to Cornwall
to see Blackwell. There they were told that the book would probably be
only about four hundred pages when printed. That seemed a bit skimpy. They
wanted to sell the book for $3.50 per copy. That was a very large sum in those
days, probably the equivalent of about $50 today, and people might not
think they were getting their money's worth.
<p>
They picked the cheapest, thickest paper the printer had, and requested
that each page be printed with unusually large margins surrounding the text.
This made for an unusually large book. Thus, the book came to be nicknamed
the &quot;Big Book.&quot;
<p>
Blackwell had an excess of red material for the bindings, so he offered
them a special deal. Eager to save costs, Bill and Hank agreed. They also
thought, according to some reports, that the color red would make the book more
attractive and marketable.<br>

http://alcoholicsanonymousnewcomer.lefora.com/2004/10/30/why-its-called-the-big-book/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are many AA sites with the same basic story.<br>
$3.50 in 1939 had the same buying power as $54.79 in 2011.
Annual inflation over this period was 3.89%.<br>
So what happened to &quot;Our hope is that when this chip of a book is launched
on the world tide of alcoholism, defeated drinkers will seize upon it, to
follow its suggestions.&quot; &#8212; page 153 of BB<br>
&quot;Though we work out our solutions on the spiritual as well as an
altruistic plane&quot; &#8212; page xxiv in the BB<br>
and<br>
&quot;We feel, after many years if experience,
that we have found nothing which has contributed more to the rehabilitation
of these men than the altruistic movement now growing up among them.&quot;
&#8212; page xxvi in the BB
<p>
altruism: unselfish <i>regard</i> for or devotion to the welfare of others<br>
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regard" target="_blank">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regard[1])</a>

<p><br>
And this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;We would like it understood that our  alcoholic work is an avocation&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
== Taken from page xiii, Foreword to First Edition
</blockquote>
<p>
avocation: a subordinate occupation pursued in addition to one's vocation especially, for enjoyment
<p>
Even while back in AA and trying to work their so called &quot;program&quot; I would
love to bring this point up to the hard headed true believers. If AA was
the altruistic movement it claimed to be why did they feel the need to make
the book unusually big with the thickest, cheapest paper they could find and
extra large margins so they could sell it for what today would be $55.
<p>
Obviously they choose the cheap red binding material to make the most profit
and not to make the book any cheaper to help &quot;save&quot; all these people dying
from alcoholism. Most would answer in a low mumble that the book was made to
spread the message and help save alcoholics and then disregard the point I
was making.
<p>
How many defeated drinkers in 1939 had the money to buy this book? How
many sponsors today would buy their new &quot;sponsee&quot; a Big Book like they do
now if they had to pay $55 instead of the $8 they get it for now?
<p>
Even the book itself was printed with deceptive motives.

<center><h3>A little info on Hank Parkhurst</h3></center>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
&quot;The problem of Hank's stock was solved when one day he showed up
&quot;completely broke and very shaky,&quot; according to Bill. &quot;He pointed out that most of
the office furniture still belonged to him, particularly the huge desk and
the overstuffed chair.&quot;
The furniture had been paid for at least once before, but Bill agreed to
pay him again if he would turn over his stock. He accepted two hundred
dollars for the furniture and turned in the stock.
<p>
But Hank resented Bill's persuading him to turn over the stock, and to
make matters worse, soon Bill was granted a royalty on the book, similar to
one that had already been voted for Dr. Bob.
Hank's son said that Hank always felt he had been treated badly and that
Bill had made a deal with the foundation that excluded Hank from any future
share in the book's profits. The entire issue was clouded by the fact that
Hank's drinking had put a wall between him and many members who eventually
supported royalty payments for Bill.
<p>
Hank wrote a memo to Bill in late 1939, which is quoted in full in &quot;Pass
It On.&quot; It asked questions that echo still today, questions about the
separation of a moneymaking business and work for the love of it, about
individualism and the cult of personality that was already beginning to gather
around Bill and Dr. Bob.&quot;<br>

Subject:  	Re: When you quit successfully &#8212; a question<br>

<p>
Terrance,

<p>
Your description of the brutal childhood you had is moving.   I believe and
that what it is and cannot be proven ... that alcohol dependence is
primarily a learned behavior.  As a small child you wanted the acceptance
and respect of your father and as a child you were not able to discern that
his opinion of you was a worthless as he was not a good role model.  You
learned unconsciously that  male adults get drunk when they are happy or
upset.  Then you had the misfortune ... of growing up in a culture where
between the ages of say 15-25 it is acceptable to get drunk out of your mind
with friends.  With that pain you were  lugging and in a culture that
promotes emotional autonomy not  interdependence in which someone would have
gone out of their way at any point on this road to coach, encourage, and
care for you ... yes it was inevitable.  That is how I explain why until
very recently female alcoholics were as rare as albinos in the country I
grew up.  Even when the father was abusive  and a drunk ... the mother was
not.  The immediate consequences of getting drunk for a woman were so
frightening that they always moderated their drinking.  Although they had
limited opportunities in terms of changing their life circumstances they
always had the comfort found in female solidarity and friendship.  They were
never a number or a statistic.  Anthropology is a science that looks at
themes regarding human behavior as it works in many cultures.  The US should
include more of  it in the study of this condition.  It would help to
moderate this raging controversy that makes one area too much focus.  I now
have returned to the country that is very similar to the one of my childhood
and *I do go out of my way to make time for the kids next door whose father
is an alcoholic.  Your letter inspires me to keep doing it. *<br>

Hello again, UNNAMED,
<p>
Thank you for spending time with the kids next door.
<p>
About learned alcoholism:
That really is the heart of the debate, you know. Nature or Nurture. Genetics or learned behavior.
When a child has an alcoholic parent, he could either inherit genes for alcoholism, or
learn it from the alcoholic parent, or both. Personally, I think it's both.
<p>
And it isn't just a matter of learning that drinking is okay because Dad did it.
There is also the whole problem that having an alcoholic parent dumps the children into
an environment that is very warped and different. The children learn a lot of values and
attitudes that come from living with an alcoholic parent.
Like the idea that you can't win.
Like the idea that you can't trust anyone.
Like the idea that it's okay to kill your pain.
Then
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">the constant stress causes the children's Cerebellar Vermises to grow malformed</a>,
which makes them feel weird and out of sorts for life.
<p>
Then, if there are several genes that modulate the risk for alcohol addiction,
and that unhappy child has inherited some of them, then you really have trouble.
<p>
It really is a complex puzzle. We need a lot more research. Unfortunately &#8212; 
or really, fortunately &#8212; it isn't possible to do randomized longitudinal
controlled studies on children, to see what makes them turn alcoholic.
<p>
Have a good day now.

what people chose to believe is as personal and God given as is their life.  just
like so many of lifes critics, people can find whats wrong with something rather
than looking for the good.
<p>
AA saved my life when all else failed....that is a fact....I have worked with many
others that could not stop drinking and don't drink today...that is a fact.    my
ignorance is always an asset

looking at whats wrong with others. AA has shown me a new way of seeing others and

<font color="blue">
Hello Kevin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on your sobriety. Nobody else and nothing else
 did that for you.
<p>
I'm sure that you believe that A.A. saved your life. A.A. is good at making people
believe that A.A did something good for them, much better at that than at actually making
people quit drinking.
<p>
You believe that A.A. saved your life. What you are ignoring is the fact that 19 other people
around you didn't benefit from the A.A. routine. A few people quit drinking by using their
own will power and determination, and then A.A. steals the credit for their hard work.
A.A. takes none of the blame for those people who don't quit drinking, or who repeatedly
relapse while working the Steps.

<p>
When you say, &quot;Look at the good&quot;, what that means is,
&quot;Don't look at the big picture. Don't see the whole thing, the good and the bad. Especially,
don't notice what is wrong with A.A.&quot;

<p>
We have to look at both the good and the bad of A.A.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">especially when A.A. kills more people than it saves</a>.
<p>
You said,
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 &quot;what people chose to believe is as personal and God given as is their life.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, beliefs are given by men, not God. Beliefs are taught.
Churches teach beliefs, and cults routinely routinely teach lots of goofy beliefs.
Unfortunately, many of those beliefs are very harmful, in addition to being untrue.
<p>
For instance, if a cult were to tell people that they should
not to go to a doctor and get medical treatment,
and should not take their children to a doctor,
rather just trust the cult's religious practices and prayers to heal them,
then I would have to denounce that belief as one very bad belief.
<p>
In fact, I've done so, many times. Here in Portland Oregon,
we have a church that claims to be Christian that routinely kills another child every couple
of years by not taking the child to a doctor when he or she is sick.
Two parents were just convicted of manslaughter, and the trial of another pair is coming up.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous does the same thing too when a sponsor tells his sponsee not to take the
medications that the doctor prescribed, and just trust the 12 Steps to heal him.
That is a very bad belief, and not from God.

<p>
It does not matter how fervently people believe in their beliefs,
that does not keep the victims of such superstition alive.

<p>
Finally, this line is great evidence for what is wrong with A.A.: obstinate anti-intellectualism
and refusal to learn the truth:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;my ignorance is always an asset&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Being ignorant of the truth is not an asset.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	i delt in the occult while going to aa.<br>

<p>
i delt in the occut while going to aa.  now i have stange
things happening to me. not being funny at all. i believe everything u
have written.  wish i knew it then.  when i would ask my sponser a question
she would tell me to do the first three steps over first.

<p>
sorry about the spelling.  as i said, she would have me do the first three steps over.
i
did this for seven years. now i have a force? spirit? trying to control my life.
 its
like its trying to make my life miserable so i will have to go back to aa.
cant do
that.
i think i have been ostracized from aa. last time i went, a women came up to me
and said what are u doing here. didnt know the person. some stare at me. i have been
yelled at in aa. told i should be ashamed of my self. some people didn't think i was
an alcoholic. i told a friend in aa when someone asked a question about me to tell
them i was writing a book.  then i went to my cousins  in wilmington for six months.
when i came back, all this crazy stuff started. went to one aa meeting and they told
me they heard i was dead. i think they would have liked. after that downhill.
eventually stopped going. whats wierd about aa is that when i attended the first
meeting i could recognize what you are talking about, but then i did get brainwashed.
u know the saying something like your brain needs a good washing. anyway this force
has missed up my life.  have you seen any evidence of hypnosis? please reply.
sincerly.
now spell check wont work.

Subject:  	aa<br>

<p>
i asked u about covert hypnosis. it happens in aa.   i graduated high school in 1970. 
i didnt literally burn my bra.  but i heard the message. i am a independent thinker.  u
know better than i how independent thinking will get u in trouble.
<p>
 when  i would talk
about myself in aa.  i would be put down by the older men in aa.  the old timer of the
group didnt like what i would say.  he would tell my sponser to put a rein one me. 
well it is horse country here.
<p>
or then the next person to share would talk about a
generational thing.  it was all about put down.   this is about the hypnosis.
<p>
the
psychiatrist that i saw in the hospital was an aa member.  saw him in aa meetings . 
in fact i was in a meeting after being absent from that meeting for a while and a
man starting saying shame on u,,, and he was very angry.  and this dr.  told the
person to be quiet.  do u know i have seen this person at a lot of meetings and he or
his wife never acted angry with me .  just one one more strange incident.
<p>
i will
never god bless anyone else or tell them to have a good day.  aa propaganda.  i am
just about to get mad about what happened to me.  i was a nurse who worked at a
health department when this happened .  not alot of experience.  i was thrown into a
different world. aa takes advadvantage of a person. but i did get what your last
person said about aa being nosey, they are. gut instinct

Hello Vicki,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your pain and suffering.
There is a lot of it going around, isn't there?
<p>
Technically, the way that they were messing with your mind is not called hypnosis, it is something else.
You might call it brainwashing. A lot of what A.A. does qualifies as brainwashing.
(<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Of course they were trying to suck you into the cult and turn you into a well-indoctrinated
person who just parroted all of the right slogans, just like them.
And who attended meetings regularly, and conformed to the group, just like them.
And who said just what they wanted to hear.
<p>
So that guy got angry with you when you weren't going along with it.
<p>
So it goes. Welcome to freedom.
<p>
And have a good day now.

Hey Terry,
<p>
There has GOT to be a easier way to send you few bucks than paypal.  I even opened
up an account so as to be able to donate ( and have in the past) and today I cant
figure the damn thing out.
I understand your need for anonomy and all of that.

PS  I am about two weeks off cigs (13 years off alcohol)  and its a BITCH.  I think
nic is tougher than booze in many ways cause smoking has never gotten me in jail or
caused me to lose my mind.  Take care.

<p>

more per month in service fees than the total donations that
I receive.  So they are out of the question.

Have a good day now.
