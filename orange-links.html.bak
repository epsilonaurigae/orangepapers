SOS: Secular Organizations for Sobriety, a.k.a. &quot;Save Our Selves&quot;.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731033450/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.sossobriety.org/</a>
<br>
SOS is an alternative recovery method for those alcoholics or drug
addicts who are uncomfortable with the spiritual or superstitious
content of widely available 12-Step programs.
SOS takes a reasonable, secular approach
to recovery and maintains that sobriety is a separate issue from
religion or spirituality. SOS credits the individual for achieving and
maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any &quot;Higher
Power.&quot; SOS respects recovery in any form regardless of the path by
which it is achieved. It is not opposed to or in competition with any
other recovery programs.<br>

Science and Practice.<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Given the prevalence of addiction in society and the extensive evidence
regarding how to identify, intervene and treat it, continued failure to do
so signals widespread system failure in health care service delivery,
financing, professional education and quality assurance. It also raises the
question of whether the low levels of care that addiction patients usually
do receive constitutes a form of medical malpractice.&quot;<br>

== Statistics on the success rates of various treatment programs.<br>
Rated by Prof. William Miller and Prof. Reid K. Hester of the University of New Mexico
Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions.<br>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.<br>
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.

Alcoholic Vervet Monkeys<br>

<br>
This is a very entertaining story about alcoholic monkeys, sneaky little guys who live at a
tropical resort and steal drinks from the tourists.
What is particularly revealing is the fact that the monkey
population has
the same percentages of alcoholics and tea-totalers as humans do.
That points to a genetic factor, as there is no way to argue that
those monkeys and humans have the same environments, society, or childhood
upbringing. And it would appear that whatever the genetic factor is,
it has not changed in the six million years since monkey and humans diverged
on the evolutionary tree.

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism &#8212; the NIAAA &#8212;

==  A reprint of a 3-part article on addictions by <i>The Harvard Mental Health Letter</i>, 1995.
This article is the source of this famous quote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font size="+2">
<b>On their own</b>
</font>
<br>
There is a high rate of recovery among alcoholics and addicts,
treated and untreated. According to one estimate, heroin addicts
break the habit in an average of 11 years.
Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was
interviewed, 57% said they simply decided that alcohol was bad
for them. Twenty-nine percent said health problems,
frightening experiences,
accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.
Others used such phrases as &quot;Things were building up&quot;
or &quot;I was sick and tired of it.&quot; Support from a husband
or wife was important in sustaining the resolution.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Treatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction &#8212; Part III</i>,
<b>The Harvard Mental Health Letter</b>, Volume 12, Number 4,

So much for the sayings that
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Everybody needs a support group&quot;</i></font>
and
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Nobody can do it alone&quot;</i></font>.

<p><li> The National Treatment Center Studies<br>
For many years now, I have been quoting the National Treatment Center in Atlanta, Georgia,
which found in 1996 that 93% of the treatment centers in the country used the 12-Step model.
Well, it turns out that they did another study in 2005, and found that only 75%
of the treatment centers are now using the 12-Step model. That is a big drop.

<font color="green">
The advice &quot;look for the similarities&quot; is really a veiled admonition
that newcomers should discard their critical faculties, and not ask
awkward but pertinent questions regarding the true agenda of the
meeting.<br>
AA's message simply does
not stand up to rational examination, hence the intellect is treated
with scorn and contempt to try to preempt such examination.

&#8212; Paul Morantz is the lawyer who sued Synanon, the crazy &quot;recovery&quot; organization turned
cult and church. Synanon responded by putting a rattlesnake in his mailbox.
They even removed the rattle from the snake so that there would be no warning buzz before the
snake stuck. The snake bit Morantz, and he nearly died. It took 14 vials of anti-venom to save him, and his
arm was permanently damaged. Nevertheless, Morantz prevailed against Synanon.

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;The callousness of these techniques &#8212; targeting the vulnerable,
building false friendships with the lonely or troubled, promising to
relieve people of the most fundamental dreads of human existence from
the fear of mortality to the numbing pain of grief &#8212; gave to the process
an awful cruelty and dishonesty.&quot;

When researching a subject,
also do research on the Internet through your public library's
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731033450/http://search.epnet.com/" target="_blank">EBSCO</a> database,
or the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731033450/http://www.elibrary.com/" target="_blank">Electric Library</a>.<br>
You may need a library card to access these databases (like your local
city library's cards). It's worth getting one.
