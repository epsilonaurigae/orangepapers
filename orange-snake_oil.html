Because the Twelve Steps are not a program for quitting
drinking, it is easy to change them
into something else that is not a program for getting off of
drugs, or not a program for avoiding
over-eating, or not a program for fixing whatever else you don't like. 
Just edit Step One, and change the
words &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; to &quot;powerless over
our addiction&quot;, or &quot;powerless over our food compulsion&quot;, or
whatever else you want to be powerless over, and then edit Step
Twelve, and change the word
&quot;alcoholics&quot; to &quot;addicts&quot;, or
&quot;overeaters&quot;, or whatever, and <i>Hey Presto!</i> you have a
new &quot;spiritual&quot; program for unsuccessfully treating some other problem or
&quot;spiritual disease.&quot;
I hear that there are now over two hundred of these clone
twelve-step programs, intended to cure (or not cure, but &quot;treat&quot;) just about everything
imaginable. Some of them sound
pretty wild, like Artists in Recovery, or Partners of Sexaholics.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
(I just can't help but wonder, is
that last group complaining or bragging?)
<p>
(And in my wild imagination, I can see an <i>Artists in Recovery</i>
meeting where a dozen crazy paint-stained guys with berets and only one ear talk
about how they really have to stop drinking that absinthe...)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p><br>

The last time we had a universal medicine that would cure so
many different ailments, it was the snake oil sold by the
traveling medicine shows.
<p>
The rest of the program, besides those words in Steps One
and Twelve, is always the same. In fact, in most all of the 12-Step
programs, Steps Two through Eleven are word-for-word identical to
the Alcoholics Anonymous steps.

<p>
Notice the funny mix of so-called &quot;spiritual diseases&quot; there:
you can &quot;cure&quot; some of them just by changing your behavior, like
alcoholism, narcotics, smoking, over-eating, sex addiction,
gambling, cocaine, or being a compulsive shopper or a clutterer.
But the others are not what we might call
&quot;voluntary&quot; diseases.
You cannot just voluntarily quit having high blood pressure,
diabetes, hepatitis C, chronic illness,
dual disorder (i.e.: having both mental and drug or alcohol problems)
or schizophrenia, so I really want to hear how listing and confessing
all of your sins, &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, and
&quot;defects of character&quot; will cure those diseases.
<p>
<a name="exploit"> </a>
Someone would have to be pretty crazy to think that doing the
Twelve Steps &#8212; performing a searching and fearless moral
inventory and confessing all of his sins &#8212; is going to cure
mental illnesses like schizophrenia and compulsive-obessive disorders.
<p>
But, come to think of it, that's just how the game works, isn't it?
Go find sick, vulnerable people who are suffering, whose
minds aren't too clear, and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#desperate" target="_blank">exploit their weaknesses</a> and
talk them into joining a cult religion while telling them that this
magical 12-Step program will heal what ails them.

The children's groups are strange, too. They are the groups like
Al-Anon, Alateen, and ACOA &#8212; Adult Children of Alcoholics.
Those groups teach that because
someone was born to alcoholic parents, he should spend the rest of
his life doing the Twelve Steps.
Didn't Alcoholics Anonymous say that the
Twelve Steps were a program for quitting drinking? Those children
don't drink, and never have.

A book that is popularly known as &quot;The Serenity Bible&quot;
tells us:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
That you have picked up
<i>Serenity</i><font face="Times,Roman,Sanserif"><sup>&reg;</sup></font>
probably
means that you or someone you love is already involved in or considering
joining a Twelve Step program of recovery. We embark on recovery
as a means of seeking freedom from any one or more of a number
of addictive agents. Addictive agents are those persons or things
on which we form an excessive dependency.
The catalog of addictive agents includes:
<ol>
<li> Alcohol or drugs
<li> Work, achievement, and success
<li> Money addictions, such as overspending, gambling, hoarding
<li> Control addictions, especially if they surface in personal,
sexual, family, and business relationships
<li> Food addictions
<li> Sexual addictions
<li> Approval dependency (the need to please people)
<li> Rescuing patterns toward other persons
<li> Dependency on toxic relationships (relationships that
are damaging and hurtful)
<li> Physical illness (hypochondria)
<li> Exercise and physical conditioning
<li> Cosmetics, clothes, cosmetic surgery, trying to look good on the outside
<li> Academic pursuits and excessive intellectualizing
<li> Religiosity or religious legalism (preoccupation with the
form and the rules and regulations of religion, rather than
benefiting from the real spiritual message)
<li> General perfectionism
<li> Cleaning and avoiding contamination and other obsessive-compulsive
symptoms
<li> Organizing, structuring (the need always to have everything in its place)
<li> Materialism
</ol>

<p>
That list of so-called &quot;addictions&quot; is, of course, absurd,
and even insane. According to the authors,
just about everything, good or bad, is an addiction.
And they apparently don't even know the difference between real
physical illnesses and hypochondria (item 10). They use the title of
doctor, but they surely are not medical doctors.
(One is a psychologist and the other runs &quot;a Christian counselling
clinic in Dallas, Texas&quot;.)
But no matter &#8212; they will prescribe the same 12-Step quack cure
no matter what your ailment may be.

But for sheer goofy wackyness, it's hard to beat Clutterers Anonymous:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...chapters of Clutterers Anonymous, a 12-step recovery program for
compulsive accumulators, are also springing up all over the country.
There are now groups in 50 cities in 17 states, including two chapters
in Pennsylvania, where participants learn the self-help, growth and
healing principles that have proven so successful in programs such as
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>

Clutterers Anonymous, or CLA, was formed in 1989 in Simi Valley, Calif.,
after several women who were doing work in Overeater's Anonymous learned
that they were also either pack-rats, or married to one, according to
Christy B., of the CLA World Service Organization. As with other 12-step
groups, the members don't reveal their last names.
<p>

The 12 steps embody a set of principles that promote inner change, she
says. &quot;We're not about teaching organizational skills, housecleaning
tips or time management,&quot; she says. &quot;We focus on the tools of
recovery that address and free us from the underlying causes of clutter.&quot;

<!----------------------------  -->
The process has worked wonders for Ruth S., a licensed professional
addictions counselor in Montgomery County, who discovered the program
through group workshops.
<p>
Through attending meetings and workshops and working closely with her
own sponsor or &quot;clutter buddy,&quot; Ruth says she has been able
to understand the kind of behavior that has led her to be constantly
surrounded by physical and emotional chaos.

<p>
&quot;It helped me to see my home as a sacred space, and to understand
how removing clutter from my life &#8212; internally and externally &#8212; has
really helped me gain clarity and control,&quot; she says.

It begins to look like the real purpose of these twelve-step
groups is to practice the twelve steps and to expand the
12-Step religion, not to cure anything.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
Of course. That has always been the objective.
</i></font>
<p>
(Starry-eyed A.A. faithful have even been
quoted as saying things like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The Twelve Steps are so wonderful
that there needs to be another Twelve-Step group, one for all of the

The real purpose of the Twelve-Step &quot;self-help
groups&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>
is to get everybody to practice
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's cult religion</a> &#8212;
&quot;The Oxford Groups&quot; &#8212; by
<i>&quot;Working The Steps&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot;</i>.
Bill Wilson even said so, very clearly:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Six months earlier,
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#stock_broker" target="_blank">the broker</a> [Bill Wilson]
had been relieved of his drink obsession by a sudden spiritual
experience, following a meeting with an alcoholic friend who had been in
contact with the Oxford Groups of that day. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;

Though he could not accept all the tenets of the Oxford Groups, he was
convinced of the need for moral inventory, confession of personality
defects, restitution to those harmed, helpfulness to others, and the
necessity of belief in and dependence upon God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, pages xv and xvi of the
Foreword.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>(In other words, he did accept all of the tenets of the Oxford Groups, but he
didn't want to admit that his so-called &quot;sobriety program&quot; was just a copy
of Frank Buchman's cult religion.)</i>
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the
spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them.
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font>
is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God...<br>

Then Bill Wilson schemed to recruit the alcoholics' entire families into his cult religion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should
neglect his family. You should continue to be friendly to them.
The family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept
and practice spiritual principles, there is a much better chance
that the head of the family will recover. And even though he continues
to drink, the family will find life more bearable.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 7, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Notice how Bill suddenly changed the advertised effect of his &quot;spiritual&quot;
Twelve-Step program from making alcoholics quit drinking to just making
the family's life &quot;more bearable&quot;.
Are the 12 steps really a program for recovery from alcoholic drinking, or are
they really something else?<br>
</i></font>
<font color="#9F0000">
Well, the truth is that the Steps are really a religion for the whole family, just like the
Oxford Group was.
</font>
<p>
And lastly, Bill wrote in the Foreword to the <i>Big Book</i> that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better
understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic
is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living
has its advantages for all.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson,
in the Foreword to the First Edition,
page xiii of the 3rd edition.</font>

<p>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;<font color="#9F0000"><b>And besides</b></font>,
it will be wonderful if we can
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt022" target="_blank">convert
everybody in the world</a> to our religion,
to 'our way of living', and have all of them under
'<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">God-control</a>',
following the dictates of a Higher Power,
doing the Twelve Steps, and seeking and doing the Will of God as we
understand it...&quot;
</i></font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And Bill's followers have tried hard to make that ambition a reality, cloning the
Twelve-Step program into a couple of hundred other groups that will
supposedly treat an absurdly large and all-inclusive list of ailments, which makes everyone
in the world a candidate for twelve-step salvation, in one guise or
another, for some disease or other, real or imagined.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The first clone was Al-Anon, for the wives and children of alcoholics.
<li> And then there was Alateen, just for the teenagers.
<li> Then there was ACOA, Adult Children of Alcoholics, where you can
confess your miserable choice of parents.
<li> Then they started 12-Step groups for drug addicts and compulsive gamblers &#8212;
Narcotics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous.

<li> Then it got really ridiculous, with groups that are downright bizarre,
groups to &quot;treat but not cure&quot;
high blood pressure, Hepatitis C, diabetes, chronic illness, compulsive
shopping, over-eating, schizophrenia, and being the partner of a sex addict, all
by doing the Twelve Steps and confessing all of your sins,
defects of character, and moral shortcomings, and then surrendering your mind
and your will...
</ul>


<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

Europeans regard that routine as pretty silly. Something that
the 12-Step true believers will never tell you is that Europe
manages to handle its drug and alcohol problems without the
Twelve Steps. Oh, the 12-Step organizations have branches over
there, of course, but they are not nearly as popular as in the
USA, and they do not dominate their nations' treatment programs
like the Steppers do in the USA.
<p>
Twelve-Step recovery is a distinctly American phenomenon, just
like Puritanism is a distinctly American phenomenon.
<p>
British researchers see it this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The application of AA dogmas to behaviours which could scarcely be termed
&quot;diseases&quot; &#8212; shopping, for instance &#8212; with all the paraphernalia
about recognizing these as illnesses over which one has no control, has a
faintly ludicrous quality. Their acceptance by many Americans testifies to
the fact that what we are witnessing here is a socio-religious phenomenon requiring
of followers the confession and repentance through which they receive status
and acceptance.
<p>
Hence the attempt to explain alcohol problems, as well as other drug problems,
in non-disease terms not only steps on commercial toes by threatening the
theoretical basis for disease-based treatment programmes, it also threatens
an entire social movement by asserting that there are other means of breaking
habits than by confession and repentance.<br>

A.A. and the other 12-Step groups like to claim that the 12-Step program

will be against further addiction.</font><br>

<a name="battering"> </a>

Al-Anon, the A.A. auxiliary for the other family members, is itself a good
candidate for the title of &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
It practices battering, just like a cruel, vicious, wife-battering husband:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First, the husband is friendly and loving, but then he turns on his
wife and threatens and beats her.
<li> Just when the wife is ready to leave, the battering
husband reverts to being loving and reassuring, telling the wife that
things will be better in the future and that he didn't really mean it
and he loves her.
<li> Then, when the wife stays, the husband soon reverts to attacking
and beating her again.
<li> Then, just when the wife is ready to leave, the battering
husband reverts to being loving and reassuring again.
<li> Eventually, the battered wife is so paralyzed by confusion and
fear that she doesn't know if she is coming or going.
<li> And worse yet, while all of that is going on, the husband convinces
the wife that it is her fault &#8212; that her bad behavior is the problem.
She starts to think: &quot;Maybe if I was a better wife, he wouldn't
get so angry. I must try harder to be a good wife and please him.&quot;
Thus, he gradually destroys what little self-respect and self-confidence
the wife has left, which makes it even harder for her to leave him.

<p>
A.A. and Al-Anon foist the same back-and-forth routine on their victims:
<p>
<ul>
<li> First you are good, then you are bad, then you are good, then you are bad...
<p>
<li> You are powerful, then you are powerless. First you are powerful and responsible for your own fate,
and responsible for your quitting drinking,
and then you are powerless and your will power is useless...
<p>
<li> You are not responsible for what was done to you.... Then you are guilty of all
kinds of defects and sins... Then you are not responsible... And then you are guilty...<br>
<p>
<li> First it's a disease over which you are powerless, and then you are a sinner who is selfish
and self-seeking and manipulative and dishonest and self-centered....
<p>
<li> In the Al-Anon 3rd Step, &quot;God&quot; supposedly loves you so
much that He will take care of your will and your life for you,
and solve all of your problems forevermore, just because you demand that
He do so. That builds up your ego and gives you delusions of grandeur
where you imagine that God is your butler, waiting on you hand and foot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But then the 4th through 7th Steps, where you make long lists
of everything that is wrong with you, and dwell on it and confess it
all to man and God, just continue the routine of having an
angry alcoholic father constantly criticizing everything that you do,
tearing you down, destroying your ego and your self-respect,
and making you feel guilty about everything.

I developed many defenses. When no longer needed, those defenses became character defects.

Drunk on feelings? There is no such thing. Having intense feelings is not the same
thing as being intoxicated by ethyl alcohol. What this woman is actually describing is
a cyclical mental disorder like a manic-depressive or bipolar disorder, where the victim
cycles between extreme emotional states, up and down, up and down.
Being flipped out in a manic state is not being &quot;drunk on feelings&quot;, and
it is not an &quot;emotional binge&quot;.

Al-Anon also got it from the Oxford Group, which taught Bill Wilson all of his cult
religion dogma.
Beverly Nichols, a contemporary journalist and former member of the Oxford Group,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Nichols_4Abs" target="_blank">described the Oxford Group
dogma and their treatment of wives</a> this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>Absolute Unselfishness</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I should have to bring a whole collection of family skeletons rattling out of the cupboard to
explain why I mistrust this apparently spotless ideal. All I care to say here is that I have
seen several people's lives brought to the brink of ruin because of
one woman's absolute unselfishness. If you strip this vague and mushy ideal to its
essentials, how does it reveal itself?
As a complete abrogation of the rights of the individual concerned.
For example, an absolutely unselfish wife must endure, year in and year out, the
persecution of a drunkard. She must never assert herself, never speak harshly to him,
never protest when he revolts her sensibilities, terrifies her children, turns her
house into a lunatic asylum, gambles away her money.
<font color="blue">
'It is not <i>him</i>,' she must say. 'It is a disease.'</font>
Or again: 'I took him for better or for worse; I must
endure to the end.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such women exist by the thousand; the Oxford Group approves of them; I do not.
They are magnificent but mad.
Unselfishness, if carried to these extremes, is an obsession that does nothing
but prolong unnecessary pain. (Read Stefan Zweig's <i>Beware of Pity</i>.)<br>
</font>

<i>All I Could Never Be</i>, Beverly Nichols, pages 262-266.

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Note that Beverly Nichols was describing the situation in the Oxford Group back in the
nineteen-twenties and -thirties.
The excuse that alcoholism is a disease was already common then.
The disease concept of alcoholism did not originate with Bill Wilson, Alcoholics Anonymous, or
Dr. William D. Silkworth, either. Bill Wilson did not invent or discover anything when
he created the A.A. cult; he just copied the Oxford Group.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When I'm willing to let my Higher Power help me face my problems today in a healthier
manner than I did in the past, I'm not as likely to recreate them.<br>

of rest, preparation, and action up to God's infintely perfect sense of timing.
