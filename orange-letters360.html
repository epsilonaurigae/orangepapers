Date:  	Wed, July 10, 2013 3:32 pm &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (answered 16 July 2013)<br>
From:  	&quot;Alexander D.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Hello, I just read your paper on AA and you confirmed my suspicions...<br>

<p>
I have 2 friends in AA... and since I moved to LA I've been &quot;invited&quot; to come along
with them to meetings a number of times... something I found very very odd as I really
only drink every now and then and I never get drunk except perhaps at long summer
barbecues by accident... The even [event, experience] of being drunk for me is sort of unpleasant and is
something I typically avoid... and I think this puts me into the class of &quot;the normal
average american beer drinker&quot; I went to bars when I was younger mostly to meet
girls and also occasionally in the event of over staying might have drank to much....
but who hasn't done this a few times in their 20s? again... normal...

<p>
so as to people remembering me on wild nights in NYC some dating back 10 years... and
now that I'm in my 30s and just a normal average guy working in LA... I'm branded an
alcoholic... one summer afternoon I was chided and given a lot of grief for having a
glass of wine while trying to play chess with my AA friend...
the reason was I had had a beer an hour before... this to him suddenly was me
&quot;knocking them back&quot; .... who &quot;knocks back&quot; a glass of wine? that was a little nuts...

<p>
this was before I knew of two girls I know have been getting pretty badly damaged by
AA... one is spiraling out of control with depression and is trying to fill up her
life with 2 meetings a day rather than coping with her real problems... that being
that she basically isn't going to be a world famous DJ and she is single and 35
years old and beginning to realize she is going to be getting more and more lonely
very soon... sad, blunt, harsh even but very true in her case and many other women
like her... she can't let go of some kind of dream she had when she was in her 20s...

<p>
the other girl is a party girl with really nothing else going on in her life... she
outright rejects AA but her partying &quot;relapses&quot; which by all means should be landing
her in jail are simply landing her in rehab centers where she is getting hard boiled
prison AA which basically is how you described it... she's mostly a victim of a
desperate need for attention which she is always trying to get from men and she
accepts this attention in the form of gifts (drugs and alcohol) and sex and
partying... she is happy as long as she is the star... she is a very typical type of
specimen that has been found around hollywood since hollywood has been called
hollywood and in fact as far as I can tell is simply copying her mother... NONE of her
issues are being addressed by AA except drinking and drugs... And TADA it's not
working...

<p>
so these people in my life are in this cult that isn't helping them at all while
they are all being told they will have all their problems fixed by this 12 step
program thats all laid out before them...

<p>
no one ever talks about what the 12 steps are however... in fact I didn't find a
summary in your paper...

<p>
I still don't know what they are and frankly I don't care... I knew it before I read
your paper that AA is hurting people... just as bad as prescribing one wonder pill to
cure everyone in a hospital you can't rationally argue that some 12 step program
replaces all rational thought or self control...

<p>
face your own demons... paddle your own canoe...

<p>
but these people are so far gone I don't know how to get them to listen to me and
take their own lives back...

<p>
one of them is my best friend... he is going to be the best man at my wedding... and I'm
scared a little bit of how insular he is becoming as result of AA here in LA... in AA
here people seem to be under the impression that they have to break ties with their
past and just go full in and only have AA friends...

<p>
like... wtf?

<p>
so... do you have any advice for me?

<p>
how can I help my friend rejoin the human race?

<p>

Hello Alexander,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the questions. The problem that you are describing is just so classic.
That is just what cults do. The cult training teaches people that the only people whom they
should associate with are other cult members.
And the only people whom they value  are other cult members.
And the only people whom they think they should listen to are other cult members.
That is a standard cult characteristic, or rather, several of them:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">11. Insistence that the group is THE ONLY WAY.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="_blank">12. The group and its members are special.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_instant_community" target="_blank">17. Instant Community.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_instant_intimacy" target="_blank">18. Instant Intimacy.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_self_absorbed" target="_blank">22. The group is self-absorbed.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_enemy" target="_blank">85. Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_own_you" target="_blank">86. The group wants to own you.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_total_immersion" target="_blank">99. Total immersion and total isolation.</a>
</ul>
<p>
(Note that you can switch between the Cult Test question and the answer for A.A. by clicking on
the number of the question or answer inside of the cult test.)

 &#8212;  While I was attending AA, I received
a lot of pressure to ditch my old friends and pursue new friendships within AA
(which I never really did because I thought most of them were losers anyway).

<li> <a href="orange-letters217.html#separatism" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters217.html#separatism</a>
 &#8212;  And then several expressed the opinion that I should
stop associating with that couple altogether.

 &#8212;  They actually encourage the break up of marriages and relationships if
the spouse or partner is not in aa.  

</ul> 

<p>
And Heaven help you if you take a drink in front of A.A. members. Oh horrors! They loose it.
<p>
I agree that your drinking habits sound boringly normal and not at all alcoholic.
But in their extreme beliefs, well-indoctrinated A.A. members think that
any departure from absolute purity is an immediate descent into Hell.  
They want to make you into an alcoholic just because you have a few drinks now
and then.
The <i>Demand For Purity</i> is another standard cult characteristic:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_perfection" target="_blank">38. An Impossible Superhuman Model of Perfection.</a>
</ul>

<p>
And the claim that they have all of the required answers to all of life's problems
 is yet another standard cult characteristic, or several of them:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_guru_right" target="_blank">1. The Guru is always right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality" target="_blank">7. Irrationality.</a> 
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea" target="_blank">71. We Have The Panacea.</a>
</ul>
<p>
As you already noticed, the 12 Steps are not good therapy for people who have mental problems like
depression. In fact, spending hours and years confessing everything that is wrong with yourself
&#8212;  all of your sins and wrongs and &quot;defects of character&quot; and 
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;  and resentments &#8212; 
is so depressing that it drives some people to suicide. Literally. Look here:
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">A.A. Suicides</a>.
<p>
That confession routine is psychologically damaging and tears you down. It does not build you
up and help you to recover. Nor does it make you spiritual. It just messes with your head.
That is why so many cults &#8212; and even Chinese Communist brainwashing &#8212; use confession sessions to
tear people down and make them more vulnerable to conversion.


<p>
I can tell you what the 12 Steps really are in one short sentence: <i><b>&quot;The 12 Steps
are Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion recruiting and indoctrination practices.&quot;</b></i>
Their major effect is religious conversion and brainwashing. (Compare the A.A. practices to
the Communist Chinese brainwashing practices,
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">here</a>.
Also see this:
<a href="orange-letters358.html#brainwash" target="_blank">Did the Chinese Communists learn
brainwashing techniques from Frank Buchman?</a>)
<p>
Bill Wilson was a member of Frank Buchman's cult, and he just copied Buchman's crazy
fascist theology to get the 12 Steps and all of the rest of the warped A.A. religious
dogma.  Here are some pages that describe the 12 Steps and their origins:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> <a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps Interpreted</a>
<li> <a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson Writes The Steps</a>
<li> <a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">The Religious Tenets and Doctrines of Buchmanism</a>
<li> <a href="orange-rroot120.html" target="_blank">The Cult Characteristics of the Oxford Groups</a>
<li> <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>
</ul>
<p>
Now for the big question: How do you rescue your friends from that loony bin?
That is difficult because cult members usually wish to remain cult members (although they won't
admit that they are in a cult.) And cult members usually immediately reject any criticism
of their cult, or any suggestion that they should leave the cult.  
I usually end up referring people to Steve Hassan's books about how to free people from a cult.
We have discussed such issues many times. Here are some of them:

<p>
Sorry to be such a pedant &#8212; it's my line of work actually &#8212; but William James's
dates are 1842-1910.
<p>
Quickly, to the point. In the very first weeks of my sobriety, I was damned damned
damned &#8212; I'd already seen it &#8212; if I would read that pea-brained Bill Wilson's
pathetic Big Book, so instead set myself to reading patiently, one chapter every
night, &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience.&quot;
<p>
30 years later, what a valuable investment of my time this has turned out to be.
James's was a capacious mind, curious about and sympathetic to almost anything
conceivable. Not for nothing did Alfred North Whitehead refer to him as &quot;that
adorable genius.&quot;
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005452/http://www.webofstories.com/play/oliver.sacks/338;jsessionid=328359347780FC1980D101438BC00186" target="_blank">

<p>
It's just an accident of geography of course, but I happen to live a few blocks away
from James's house at 95 Irving Street. Every time I pass by there's a certain buzz
&#8212; yes, giants have indeed trod this earth! &#8212; along with a feeling of gratitude.
<p>
My conclusion (and his): Sober is better.

Subject:  	What really keeps me sober?<br>

<p>
I do not know nor I do not know if I will ever know what keeps me sober?
God? Steps? ego deflation? helping people? what the hell....
i hope you respond...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the question. That's a good one.

<p>
I have a pretty good idea of what keeps me sober.
I don't have a &quot;program&quot; or a method or a strategy for staying sober. It's more like just
a collection of odds and ends attitudes and ideas and beliefs.
Like the idea that I don't want to die that way, and the belief that committing suicide is usually
a very stupid thing to do.

<p>
I chose to quit drinking after my doctor said, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
And he wasn't joking. I was so sick that I could believe him too. It was close to the end (and he said so).
Strangely enough, when push came to shove, I decided to live. In spite of the fact
that I had been drinking for 20 years, and smoking and drugging for 30 years, I just suddenly
quit all of them because I decided to live.

<p>
I still get thoughts of drinking. I just had it happen again a couple of hours ago. The new TV series
&quot;Under The Dome&quot; had a commercial on TV, advertising the next show, where they said that the
Army was going to target the dome with missiles and try to blow the thing away, and everybody
under the dome would die. So the people under the dome were doing the usual end-of-the-world
partying (like we've seen in so many sci-fi movies).
One woman was drinking a bottle of wine, and she held out a glass in invitation.
<p>
Suddenly, in my mind's eye, I was in the movie, thinking about accepting the offered glass of wine.
If I was there, why not drink? What would it matter, if we were all going to die the next morning?
Who are you saving it for? I could drink and party with her until the end.
<p>
But then I thought, &quot;No, I'd rather go out sober.&quot;
Funny how that works. Even in a fantasy, you can still have values.
And I notice that I value sobriety.  And it isn't just sobriety for sobriety's sake. It's for very
specific things like being clear-headed and having memory that works.
<p>
Those two things are a big deal. It took me nine months to recover from alcohol enough to be able
to remember faces, and five years to get my short-term memory back.
And it took several years to really get the clarity back, and I'm not eager to lose it now.
Even just a little alcohol can destroy the clarity.
That's one of the things that keeps me sober.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters345.html#prosopagnosia" target="_blank">Inability to remember or recognize
faces is called &quot;Prosopagnosia&quot;</a>,
and it can be caused by either alcohol-induced brain damage or by poisoning with
toxic industrial chemicals. I guess, when you come right down to it, alcohol
qualifies as a toxic industrial chemical.
<p>
It's hard to describe how weird it is, not having working memory. People say hi to you by name, and they know
you and know a bunch of things about you, and you can't remember ever having seen them before in
your life.  It's so surreal that it feels like the Arnold Schwartzenegger movie &quot;Total Recall&quot;
where people were erasing his memory and lots of people knew him from his past, but he didn't
know them. 

<p>
Then there are a lot of odds-and-ends reasons for staying sober: Like waking up without a hang-over.
I'm happy to say that I haven't had a hang-over in more than 12 years now. And then, even a little
alcohol can make you wake up the next morning feeling a little fuzzy-headed, even if you aren't hung over.
The clarity is gone. I don't like that.

<p>
Then there is the big thing that if I got drunk, there is a very good chance that I'd want a cigarette,
just to make the room stop spinning.
My will power and resistance to the temptation of a cigarette is weak when I'm drunk.
And that is the kiss of death. Tobacco nearly killed me.
And it is so addicting that I had to come down with bronchitis and pneumonia to get the motivation to
really quit and stay quit. I really don't want to go back there again. And if staying sober is what
it takes to stay off of cigarettes, then I consider that a small price to pay.

<p>
Then there is the self-respect thing. That is, I can feel good about the fact that I finally got it
together and have 12 1/2 years of sobriety now. I don't care to lose that. And if I did relapse, 
thousands of the hostile Steppers would be crowing and cheering. I just don't care to give them
the satisfaction.
<p>
Then there is the health thing. The quality of my entire life is completely different from how it
was when I was smoking and drinking. I was basically chronically sick and depressed, for many
years. I never
got on my bicycle and went and fed the ducks and geese, and enjoyed the fresh air and sunshine.
(Didn't even have a bike.)
Health-wise, I'm basically on another planet now. And I don't care to go back to being chronically
half-sick.

<p>
Now, for some hints and kinks and techniques for quitting and staying sober, I wrote up a few letters describing
some of mine:

<font color="blue">
Thank you. That's good. There is suddenly a lot of publicity about the dangers of attending A.A. meetings,
including
 going on the Katie Couric show on TV</a>
 and talking about the dangers.
<p>
So that sexual exploitation happened in southeastern Pennsylvania, huh? It's happening everywhere.
<p>
The author's last sentence said, &quot;there aren't even any 'suggestions' in the
Big Book or 12&amp;12&quot; (regarding not sexually exploiting newcomer women).
Actually, there are some suggestions about sex in the <i>Big Book</i>.
Bill Wilson said that wifey was being hysterial and
her vision was highly colored when he cheated and philandered, and when he stepped out, wifey should just
shut up and forget it. Parrotting Bill's crazy teachings, 
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#colored_grievances" target="_blank">the women of Al-Anon say to the other wives</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When a newcomer to Al-Anon tells his or her sponsor about the
alcoholic conflict in the home, we must realize this is only one
side of the story.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first these reports of our grievances are highly-colored and
dramatized by our confusions. A small incident may be blown up out
of all proportion to its reality; constant tension, anger and
frustration have deprived us of a rational perspective.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Growth in Al-Anon brings us to compassionate understanding of the
alcoholic's deep guilt and unhappiness. As we apply the program
day by day, we become willing to acknowledge that we, too,
must share the responsibility for the family troubles.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>One Day At A Time In Al-Anon</i>,
Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, 1990, page 162.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then, in the <i>Big Book</i>, 
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Bill_philandering" target="_blank">Bill wrote these instructions for how to cheat on your wife</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... 
If we are sure our wife does not know, should we tell her?
Not always, we think...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Our design for living is not a one-way street. It is as good for the wife as for
the husband. If we can forget, so can she. It is better, however, that one
does not needlessly name a person upon whom she can vent jealousy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, pages 80-82.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Isn't that neat? Cheat on your wife, but don't tell wifey because she will become
jealous and vindictive towards the other woman.
Then tell wifey to forget it.
<p>
Then, in a classic textbook example of psychological <i>projection</i>,
Bill Wilson actually struck back at Lois and accused her of being unfaithful.
In the <i>Big Book</i> chapter <i>&quot;To Wives&quot;</i>, which was supposedly
written by the wives of the alcoholics, but was really written by Bill Wilson,
Bill put these words into the mouths of &quot;the wives&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have told innumerable lies to protect our pride and our husbands' reputations.
We have prayed, we have begged, we have been patient.
We have been hysterical.
We have been terror stricken. We have sought sympathy. We have had retaliatory love
affairs with other men.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, &quot;To Wives&quot;, page 105.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson was cheating on his wife, so he accused the wives of cheating on their husbands.
As if his behavior would be okay because everybody is doing it.
And that is Bill Wilson's holy &quot;Big Book&quot; advice about sex.  

<p>
Laura Thompkins left a good comment, too.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	website<br>

<p>
Hey man, I like your website.  I don't agree with all of it but I've
definitely had my struggles with this whole cult thing.  I was in Midtown
and still have a lot of friends there but just recently pulled all the way
out, which is very difficult.  In my mind it was the only way to go, and
I'm sure I'm going to have a long bumpy road ahead of disillusionment
looking back, which I'm sure is pretty typical of someone leaving a
cohesive organization like that.
<p>
 I've been in and out for a while, and
quite frankly I'm sick of being told things like it's all my fault or being
surrounded with people who care more about their own sobriety and state of
mind or supporting an agenda of mythical beliefs than they do about the
actual welfare of others.
<p>
  The other thing that you may not have discussed
so much in your website that is the dead truth is that no one actually
cares.  They don't care when someone dies, they see it as a knock to the
A.A. program, or &quot;another one bites the dust&quot; or something like that.  But
I rarely ever see anyone grieve someone's death, and my friends who are
still in are led to believe that such displays of emotion are somehow
selfish.  I can tell they are struggling with it, but of course that might
just be my perception.

<p>
Anyways, it seems like your website needs a face lift, which I could help
you with if you want.  I do website design sometimes and I think you have a
lot of really good points but the way they're presented are in very
fanatical ways.  I think you could clean up the site some and have people
take you more seriously.  I'd be willing to do that as a project if you'd
like.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Robbie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the offer of help. I have often thought about a facelift for
the web site and improving the appearances. And maybe a little more artwork.
<p>
But right now the most pressing issue is finding
a new host for the web site. Hostmonster, which I've been using, is really bad and they are
constantly screwing things up and overloading their servers by overselling, and thus
causing things to break down.
I have been unable to get into my email for as long as a week at
a time when Hostmonster has broken the system again.
<p>
I would like to co-locate my own server somewhere. I can do a far better job of running a host system
than Hostmonster is doing.
 I'm looking into that.
<p>
I quite agree about the A.A. members not caring. I find it appalling that when someone dies after
having done the 12 Steps and stopping taking his medications on instructions from his sponsor, that
someone opines, &quot;Some must die so that others may live.&quot;  No. That is rubbish.
Joe Blow does not have to die to help me to stay sober.

<p>
I don't know what you mean by &quot;the way they're presented are in very fanatical ways.&quot; 
I research very carefully, and always err on the side of understatement. I know that when someone 
contradicts the corn-pone wisdom that &quot;everybody knows&quot; about alcoholism
and addictions  &#8212;  because A.A. has been repeating their
lies for 75 years now  &#8212;  that it sounds extreme. But it isn't; it's the truth.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Ur a genius!!!<br>

<p>
I just happened upon your pages while google searching things to debunk the
&quot;amazing&quot; AA theories. LOL!!

<p>
I am 33 years old. When I was 7 my father, who was a healthy successful person who
ran marathons, became addicted to opiates due to an illness. My mom and aunt, who
were heavily involved in Al-anon, forced me to go to Al-a-teen meetings. I was so
young and I hated those meetings. I remember very clearly how awful I felt sitting
in those rooms. It was so depressing and all anyone talked about were heavily
negative things and events. I am not a psychologist (although I spent years in
useless therapy), but my common sense tells me that those meetings were quite
possible largely traumatic, more so even than what was going on in my family, in a
certain way. What better way to learn about drugs than to be in a room where that's
all they talk about?! Lol! Smart move al-a-teen/tot!! I just learned to ride a bike
at 33, I was too busy as a child learning about addiction ;)

<p>
I felt like somehow what was going on in my family was somehow my fault. How sad for
all children put in this position. Your parents are supposed to be the ones helping
you and allowing you to enjoy your childhood. I have no happy memories from mine.

<p>
In high school I got into using cocaine for a year on and off... Still functioning
in my life in many ways.

<p>
One day I wanted to stop and expressed this to my dad (who was still using and
preaching AA at the same time, lol!!), and he immediately threw me in rehab where I
was filled with more and more 12 step dogma.

<p>
I never used drugs and/or alcohol more than on a &quot;binge for a couple days&quot; basis and
always functioned at a high level.

<p>
My common sense always told me &quot;alcoholism&quot; is not a disease, from the time I was a
child it was easy to see that if someone puts u in a space where everyone is telling
u r something that u can easily become convinced that u are that thing.

<p>
I have questioned AA theories for 26 years. I did somatic experiencing therapy that
got me in touch with traumas I've experienced and AA was one at the top of my
list. I went in and out of that program, no matter what my common sense told me,
because I listened to the people around me. I never believed I was an alcoholic, but
an innocent victim of their dogma whose life was negatively altered because of it.

<p>
I am finally at an age and point in my personal life that I feel more than confident
in standing up for my beliefs. I read tons of scientific research that debunks AA
dogma and I thoroughly enjoy it.

<p>
I work in wellness coaching and am expanding my practice to help people through
addictive behaviors with positive self management tools. I also start Somatic
Experiencing training this fall so that I can help people deeply recover from such
traumas

<p>
It is my personal mission to help as many people and families through these methods
in hopes that more children can actually enjoy their childhoods while their parents
find a positive path to deal with their own issues.

<p>
Thank you for putting your intelligent information out there!!

<p>

Thank you for the letter. That says a lot. Shoving the 12-Step religion and quackery on children is

I hope you can forgive one instance of using the email list     to forward something
a friend forwarded to me.

<p>
I especially like     number four as antidote to &quot;You may be right,&quot; and number two
as contrary     action when someone expects me to go gentle with that malicious twit
who     roused my eternal wrath.

<p>
If I'm wrong to use the list in this way, I     trust you will punish me in
inappropriate     ways.

<p>
Paraprosdokians [par-a-pros-dok-i-ans] are figures of speech     in which the latter
part of a sentence or phrase is surprising or     unexpected; frequently humorous.

<p>
1. Where there's a will, I want  &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp; to be in it.

<p>
2. The last thing I want to do is hurt you, but it's  &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp; still on my list.

<p>
4. If I agreed with you, we'd both be  &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp; wrong.

<p>
5. We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in  &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp; public.

<p>
13. I used to be indecisive, but now I'm not so  &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp; sure.

<p>
16. You're never too old to learn something  &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp;  stupid.

<p>
17. I'm supposed to respect my elders, but its getting harder and harder for me
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp; to find one now.

Hello again, Ctmjon,

Thanks for the laugh, and a genuine lesson in yet another linguistic trick.

Hello Kenneth,
<p>
That article is quite good. And right on. The author's observations agree with mine.
Even though the first words uttered from the plastic-laminated dogma at every A.A. meeting are:
<p>
<h3>
1. [We] Admitted we were powerless over alcohol...
</h3>
<p>
I've never seen a TV program portray that correctly.
They always gloss over the cultish aspects of the 12 Steps. Now why is that?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	Hey<br>

<p>
I just read your fancy paper with all your fun graphs and proof AA does not
work. It seems to be working for me pretty good. I guess the difference is I do
not expect NA (I am a recovering heroin addict) to solve the issue of my
illness. I detoxed myself on the couch just like you described tired of
watching people die or go to jail. The reason I stick around NA is partly
because I do not want to relapse, but also to show people who are checking out
meeting that people do recover. Also that life gets better. I go to NA to
improve my quality of life. I also enjoy the spiritual principles outlined in
the program. No program sent me there, no one told me it was the only way to
get clean. Nor did I even tell my ex-husband that he needed to attend meetings
to stay clean (unfortunately he is not clean, hence the ex part).
<p>
I am sure you are receiving a bunch of mean emails from die hard 12stepers. I
don't want to criticize you, you obviously put a lot of hard work into this
paper. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about 12 step programs. It's
like someone who was scared by Catholic School. I just wanted to let you know
some of us are into it because we truly care about others and want to stop
being leaches on society. You will hear in meetings you don't have to work the
steps to stay clean, but they do help the quality of life (emotionally not
materially). That part I do agree with. Whether I was a spontaneous remission
case or not. For me it is all about not living dirty any more in active
addiction and also in my previous clean time (2yrs) I didn't find much joy in
life. If I can't connect with life on life's terms which is what NA teaches
me. It is hard for me to grasp a reason to not do heroin it's amazing. I mean
YOLO right?(that was sarcasm I hate that term). Just the YOLO part though.
Seriously there was not 1 reason for me until I started to change my actions
and my thinking. Now I am coming on 2 1/2yrs scary time since I didn't make it
last time, but I am grounded in NA and I want to stay that way. After all it's
parent program AA worked well for my own parent. My dad is one of those 36yr
chip people. I have never once seen him touch a drink.
<p>
Thanks for your time.<br>
Elisa<br>
Sent from my iPad<br>

<font color="blue">
Hello Elisa,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
Congratulations on quitting heroin. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
I'm sorry to hear that your ex-husband is not.  
People quit their bad habits when they choose to, and not until. You chose to quit, and your ex-husband
did not. So it goes.
<p>
And I hate to have to disillusion you, but there are no &quot;spiritual principles outlined in
the program.&quot;  None.
<ul> 
<li> Confessing that you are powerless over drugs or alcohol (or tobacco) is
not spiritual, it is self-crippling.<br>
(And you are obviously not powerless over your addiction; you detoxed yourself as an act of strong willpower.
Congratulations.)

<li> Declaring that you are insane but some ghost or spirit will fix
your brain and restore you to sanity is barking mad lunacy, not spirituality. 
<li> Expecting some &quot;god&quot; to take care of your will and your
life for you is delusional infantile narcissism, not spirituality.  
<li> Listing and confessing all of your sins and
moral shortcomings and wrongs is self-damaging behavior, not spirituality.
<li> Demanding that a &quot;god&quot; or &quot;higher power&quot; remove all of your defects and shortcomings
is a Pharisiacal demand for a miracle, not spirituality. It also borders on black magic.
<li> Going around apologizing to everybody whom you ever offended is more self-damaging behavior,
just more wallowing in guilt. That isn't spiritual.  
<li> Imagining that a spirit talks to you and gives you instructions and work orders
and the power to carry them out in Step 11 is more insanity and 
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">dabbling in the occult</a>,
not spirituality.
<li> And &quot;carrying the message to others&quot; is recruiting for the cult, not spirituality.
</ul>
<p>
The 12 Steps are actually gross heresy, not spirituality. Check out
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.  

<p>
You said,
<font color="black">
&quot;You seem to have a chip on your shoulder about 12 step programs. It's
like someone who was scared by Catholic School.&quot;
</font>
No, that isn't it at all. I am just very
strongly opposed to fake spiritual teachers and quack doctors who mislead and hurt people.
And that is the final result of the 12-Step routine. Steppism kills more people than it saves.
And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">that was proven by a doctor
who became a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>,
and he still loves the 12-Step cult religion, and
is its biggest promoter, even though it doesn't cure people.

<p>
This is nonsense:
<font color="black">
&quot;If I can't connect with life on life's terms which is what NA teaches me&quot;.
</font>
I know that is a standard Stepper slogan, but it is still nonsense. What are life's terms?
Well, you have to breathe or you will die. You have to drink water and eat food or else you will die.
You have to avoid damaging situations like jumping from tall buildings.
You have to avoid poisoning yourself, or overdosing on some drug.  
Since you are alive to write a letter to me, I have to assume that you already know how to connect
with life on life's terms.
What that slogan really means is that they want you to live on the cult's terms, which you do not
have to do.

<p>
And no, the Steps do not
<font color="black">&quot;help the quality of life (emotionally not materially).&quot;</font>
The Steps actually raise the death rate in alcoholics (and drug addicts), and also increase
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">the suicide rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">the divorce rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">the arrest rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">the cost of hospitalization</a>.  
Spending years in meetings confessing how bad you are is very damaging.
<p>
About not finding much joy in life: That sounds like a depression problem. Have you talked to 
a qualified psychiatrist? And since you mentioned that your father is a 36-year-chip man,
that means that you were raised in a Stepper household. Have you considered what effect the
12-Step environment had on your mind while you were growing up, and your resulting depression
and inability to enjoy life?
Your sad state of mind may be due to a lifetime of exposure to
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's remake of Frank Buchman's
toxic perverted philosophy</a>.
Buchmanism is really poisonous, you know, and will seriously mess with your mind.  

<p>
You couldn't think of any reason not to take heroin (without Steppism)? Let me give you several:
<p>
<ol>
<li> It's too expensive.
<li> You waste your life chasing a fix. You can't think about much else.
<li> You end up doing all kinds of things that you would rather not do, just to get another fix.
<li> Heroin turns nice people into real assholes.
<li> You live a life of paranoia when you are a junkie.
<li> Heroin costs you everything else in life, like the joys of a normal marriage or love affair,
or enjoying lazing in the sun by the beach on a summer day.
<li> Shooting poor-quality drugs messes up your lungs and the rest of your body too.
<li> Being sick isn't any fun.
<li> There is always the danger of an overdose.
<li> Being a junkie really reduces your self-esteem.
<li> In the beginning, heroin seems like just a nice feeling, just a pleasant buzz for the evening,
but in the end, it's hell. Heroin is insidious, the way it sucks you in and betrays the promise.
<li> Sharing needles (which you will do, sooner or later) will get you some of the worst diseases in the world.<br>
(I know a little bit about what I'm talking about there. I got infected with Hep C while sharing needles,
shooting heroin and cocaine.)
</ol>
<p>
By the way, that list is the start of a &quot;cost-benefit analysis&quot;.
If we do another list, of the benefits of taking heroin, like that it kills the
pain and feels good, then that would be a cost-benefit analysis,
which is one way to look at things and decide which gives the greater benefits.
Look
<a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters15.html#cost_benefit2" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters38.html#cost_benefit3" target="_blank">here</a>
for more about the cost-benefit analysis.

<p>
I don't know what YOLO means. 
<p>
Now, do you have to be alone, or recover alone? No, of course not. All that I'm saying is that the
12 Steps are total fraud and cult religion bullshit that is
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">intended to mess with your mind</a>.  
You can find a variety of recovery groups and organizations where they will give you moral support
and encouragement without shoving old cult religion and misinformation on you.
Check out this list:<br> 
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>
<br>
And here are some raps about various people's recoveries:<br>
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a> 

<p>
Lastly, congratulations on hanging in there for 3 1/2 years. I also relapsed once,
at the three-year point, about 22 years ago. I thought that a little nibbling
&#8212; just a few beers &#8212; would be okay, but I got sucked right back
into the habit, and drank for another 9 years.  But now I have 12 1/2 years
clean and sober (and without any meetings or Steps or any of Bill Wilson's crazy dogma).
You can treat your previous relapse as a learning experience. You don't have to make the
same mistake again.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life now.
