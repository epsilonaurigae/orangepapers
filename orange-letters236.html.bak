Subject:  	Hello terrance,<br>

<p>
Hello Mr Orange!

<p>
My name is Remi, I am 30, I live in Paris, France.

<p>
I have had a drug addiction problem (alcohol and marijuana), ruining my life for
the last 12 years, that finally led me to join a NA meeting last sunday (may 1st
2011). That first meeting was emotionaly intense for me. I felt very warmly
welcomed and instantly had the feeling that this would &quot;cure&quot; me from my
&quot;uncurable disease&quot;. As I really want to do anything to keep on not doing drugs
anymore ( I quit a week before but started to drink on a daily basis ) I decided
to trust this program, and, as they recommend, go 90 meetings in 90 days.

<p>
But as a very paranoiac person I was spending my nights (falling asleep when you
stop drugs can be a hastle) on the internet trying to find information about NA
as a cult. I had the feeling that something was wrong as I did my second and
third meetings. The &quot;let's pray alltogether thing&quot; kinda freaked me out. But as
a sincere individual I asked them about that and they told me it was normal not
to accept the God thing at first and that I just had to keep on coming because
&quot;it works&quot;. But because I am a very scientific oriented person I like the
scientific randomized longitudinal controlled studies method to validate an
hypothesis .

<p>
Since I am french i was trying to find information in my language, but
everything I would find would be information provided by NA themselves : &quot;it
works&quot; &quot;come back&quot;
<p>
The fact is I was wondering : since it works, why am I hearing people saying around
the meetings, &quot;I am in the NA program for years but I went back to drugs several
times during these years&quot; &#8212; and others answering because &quot;you did not do the 12
steps&quot; or mostly &quot;because you did not come to the meeting anymore&quot;. But it seemed
totally unlogical way of thinking to me. I thought : It's not because they did not
come to the meeting that they went back to drugs, it is because they went back to
drugs that they did not go to the meeting. It's not because you play basketball
that you will become tall, it is because you are tall that you will be likely to
play basketball. This meets what you say about the green room that would cure people
because people in green room cure.

<p>
So I had the (holy fuck) good idea to look for information in english since I
understand it not too bad and I ended on your site, I was so happy to read your
facts and point of view about this NA/AA programs that match my intuition. You
got me out of their trap. I did 6 meetings in 6 days, I had this growing bad
feeling about the whole thing but I was afraid to come back to drugs so I was
hanging to this 12 steps hope program (only for 6 days, but still the brainwash
had started to take over my fragile newly unaddicted brain).

<p>
The only good things about this program in my opinion is to accept that you have
lost control on drugs and that you should not think that you can control it
anymore so you have to totally stop doing any drugs. That you should apologize
to the people you could have hurt in the past. That you should share your bad
experience about drugs because it could prevent a kid from starting this shit.

<p>
Ok, this said, I send you a huge thank you from france where there is absolutly
no information about your excellent analysis of this crime so monstrous, so
evil, and so sick,
that it is basically unbelievable ( quoting your What's not good about AA ).

<p>
If you ever need help in your fight for the truth you think I could provide
(french translation for example) you can contact me I would be pleased to add my
brick to your wall against this worlwide terrible scam.

<p>
Today its been 6 days I did not do any drugs or alcohol, and I now know NA has
nothing to do with it. I did it. Now I feel strong enough to hold it like that.
It took time to come to this wise decision, and I will surely not swap an
addiction for another.

<p>
Remi, addic..... no.....FREE!!!

<p>
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK

<p>
PS : At my 6th meeting (today) I asked to speak for the first time and told what
I just told you, but I understood that there is nothing to do for already
lobotomized people here, they were just smiling at me and, when I had finish
speaking, I just had the &quot;thank you Remi&quot;. Sad.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Remi,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and all of the compliments, and the report from France.
It sounds like you are doing well. You understand the situation and I think you will do just fine.
<p>
I don't know if you found it yet, but I have a letter that lists a bunch of links to what other people
and I have found to be helpful for getting and staying clean and sober, here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

 I suggest that as something positive to read, just so that it isn't all negative.

<p>
Sir,
I cannot, but, wonder if you ever attended an AA meeting in your life or just
read literature.  AA is not a religion and it is only for people who &quot;want&quot; to
try it.  We do not advertise in press, radio or films, nor do we get involved in
outside issues.

<p>
Anyone can write a negative article like you did.  They exist in almost every
&quot;organization&quot;.  We do not save drunks, nor do we get them sober.  We give them
an opportunity to try a different method of running their lives.  Obviously
their own thinking has failed them.  Those who come to scoff are free to leave.

We are a program of attraction.......not promotion

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kent,
<p>
I've been to many A.A. meetings. Please read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction, here</a>.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a program of attraction, it is a program of promotion and propagandizing and
coercion.
A.A. does everything in its power to promote A.A. There is an endless stream of propaganda:
TV programs like the Hallmark &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;, and
the recent &quot;When Love Is Not Enough&quot;, which were some real fairy tales that had 
little to do with the truth.

And then there are the plugs in other TV shows and movies that all proclaim that A.A. is wonderful and
is the best way to recover. <i>Cagney and Lacy, Hill Street Blues, 
ER, Dr. Phil, Dr. Drew, The West Wing, The History Detectives</i>...
And then <i>28 Days, Clean and Sober, The Days of Wine and Roses</i>...
<a href="orange-letters191.html#plugs" target="_blank">Look here</a> for longer descriptions of some of those things.

<p>
Then there are the magazine articles and books that again parrot the misinformation.
Try reading these:

<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>Spirituality: The key to recovery from alcoholism</i></a><br>

<li> <a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">More A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-big_lie.html" target="_blank">More Big Lies &#8212; A.A. Propaganda As Usual</a>
<li> <a href="orange-Galanter.html" target="_blank">More A.A.-Booster Propaganda: the book
<i>Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion</i>, by Marc Galanter</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters190.html#quack" target="_blank">Five more fake-science AA-booster papers</a>

<li> <a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry Tiebout: The First Fascist Mad Scientist of A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-Vaillant02.html" target="_blank">Answer to a George Vaillant Speech</a>
</ul>

<p>
Then read about all of the people sentenced to A.A. in one small Massachusetts town in just a few months,
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Lastly, Alcoholics Anonymous most assuredly is a religion. It makes a lot of superstitious crazy claims
like that if you confess your sins enough, &quot;God&quot; will like you and will make you stop drinking.
That is not only a religion, it is a very heretical religion.
Read this:
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Barry,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And thanks for the Geese too. (I'm talking about the 
Canada Geese that inhabit our lakes and rivers.)

<p>
I have been invited to an interview with one Internet radio station, which I will probably get
around to doing. But the TV shows don't seem to want the truth. They want sensational
stories of dramatic recoveries through religious or &quot;spiritual&quot; programs.
They just seem to have that bias. They want the standard American myth: The bad boy does all kinds of
outrageous things until he crashes and &quot;hits bottom&quot;. Then he sees the light and &quot;gets God&quot;
and starts living the good life.  That is what they consider proper entertainment.
They don't seem to want any other story.

<p>
Similarly, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal contacted me a few years ago about doing an
article. He interviewed a bunch of my correspondents, and collected a bunch of information,
and wrote it up. But then the WSJ editors would not publish the article.
They seemed to feel that recovery without expensive 12-Step treatment programs was not relevant
to the business world.
<p>
Whatever.
<p>
Have a good day.

As far as your being interviewed by mainstream media... I think they are well
paid by multi corporations to bury truth. Same way as they coddle the
political stripe that feeds them. Oh well the cat can't stay in the bag

Hello again, Barry,

Funny that you should mention hummingbirds. I love those things too.
Several years ago, I (or we) had the good luck to find a little hummingbird that was
laying dying on the sidewalk one evening, and I took it home and nursed it back to
health. And fell in love with the little thing. Unfortunately, I did not have a camera
at that time, and do not have a single picture of it. And it was beautiful, too.
I could have gotten some great pictures, if only...
<a href="orange-letters20.html#hummingbird" target="_blank">The story is here</a>.
<p>
One friend says, &quot;Terry, you can't bring all of Mother Nature inside your house.&quot;
No, but I can try.
<p>
And I'm looking around for a hummingbird feeder. The hummingbirds are around
here now. I saw my first hummingbird of the year just a few days ago,
just a little ways down the street.

About the interview, yes, something good might come of it.

Dear Sir,

<p>
I read your paper.

<p>
My name is Denise; I'm an alcoholic.

<p>
51, white, female, married, middle class. NOTHING in the past has helped me, except
ONLY the care and love of other concerned members, who know exactly how I feel when
it comes to booze.

<p>
Maybe it didn't work for some, but it works for me. I am sober and I love life. I
couldn't do this on my own, and I too thought AA was just a bunch of hoo-hah. Until
absolute desperation drove me to it.

<p>
So I'm one person, just one individual, but am telling the truth. And I'm a better,
richer soul than I have ever been. Therefore it works for me.

<p>
Thanks for reading!

<font color="blue">
Hello Denise,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you have gotten a grip on your compulsions and you 
are feeling better now.
<p>
Nothing in your letter shows that A.A. actually works. You drank until you were so desperate that
you quit. Welcome to the club. Millions have done it that way.
That includes me. The fact that you also went to
some meetings of a club at the same time does not show that the superstitions of the club did anything
good. It is all fine and well that you get some feelings of companionship from the club, but that
is not &quot;treatment&quot; for &quot;alcoholism&quot;, or &quot;something that works&quot;.
<p>
It is not a matter of &quot;Maybe it didn't work for some...&quot; When A.A. was properly tested, it didn't work
for anybody. The success rate with A.A. was <i>worse</i> than the success rate without A.A.:
Getting no A.A. yielded
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
 a lower rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">
 a lower rate of rearrests</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
a lower death rate</a>.
<p>
To say, &quot;I went to A.A. and then I quit drinking, so A.A. is responsible for me quitting drinking,&quot;
is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc" target="_blank">the same broken logic</a> as this:
&quot;Susan went to church every Sunday and prayed a lot. After a while, Susan got pregnant. That proves it:
Going to church and praying makes girls get pregnant.&quot;

Have a good day now.

I hope you find happiness. I hear only anger in your words. A.A. Works for some

a knack for writing. Instead of bashing A.A? Why not bash sex offenders or bad

Hello Julia,
<p>
Thanks for the concern, but I am really quite happy now. I have 10 years of sobriety, and 
have not even smoked a cigarette in 10 years.
I am also free of all cults, thank God.
<p>
Your claim that &quot;A.A. Works for some people, some it doesn't.&quot;
is just plain wrong. We were just discussing the same thing in the previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters236.html#effect1" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Why &quot;bash&quot; A.A.? Well, because A.A. is a hoax that harms more people than it helps.
A.A. does everything from
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raise the rate of binge drinking</a>
to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">raise the death rate</a> in alcoholics.

A.A. also raises the divorce rate and suicide rate in the sick people who go to A.A.
<p>
And that's why I write what I do.
<p>
Now if you dispute what I'm saying, why don't you present us with some properly-conducted medical tests of
Alcoholics Anonymous that demonstrate how well A.A. really works?
I described how to do a proper <a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study here</a>.

I am glad to see your forum is up and running.  Can you please find a spam
filter because the spamming is very annoying. I would suggest asking Friend the
Girl or MA over at Stinkin Thinkin about how they manage to stay spam free.

Hello Martha,
<p>
Thanks for the note. Yes, I agree that the spam is very annoying. I have to spend 15 to 30 minutes
a day deleting it.
<p>
I know how other people are keeping the spam off of their systems. They are using things like
the Drupal anti-spam module. Unfortunately, it turns out that it works with version 6 of Drupal, but
not version 7, yet, which is what I installed so that I would have the latest and greatest
version of everything.
I cannot go back to version 6 without blitzing the whole forum and starting over, and erasing
everybody's postings. So in the mean time, until the Drupal guys get the spam filter working,
I am doing a few other things:
<p>
First, I just had to change the registration procedure. Previously, people could register and
they would be automatically approved when they answered the email that the forum sent to their
email address. But a Russian spam-bot was hammering the system, and creating hundreds of new
logins, and posting one spam message per login. Now, that won't work. But I have to hand-approve
each new registration, which is a hassle.
<p>
And then I am just cancelling accounts and erasing the spam as fast as I find it.
I think that most of it will disappear soon, now that the spammers cannot just mechanically create
new logins and spam messages all night long.

<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Mary&quot;<br>
Subject:  	I'm an AA member that appreciates your site<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,
<p>
I am a current member of AA, been sober in AA since 1992, and I LOVE your
site!  It is an amazing compilation of valuable information and I am
grateful to have found it, and other AA-critical sites as well some years
ago.  AA folks that curse at you need to chill!

<p>
I attend my homegroup and participate there, and find it to be a liberal
meeting as opposed to the hard-line kinds, but have also gained a huge
release from 'step fear' by reading your site and other AA-critical sites on
the web.  I had been to so many meetings over the years that I had really
built up a fear of not doing the steps 'right'.  I always viewed AA as my
only option to stay alive and I'd better not screw it up!  That fear was
rough to live with every day, I felt like a fraud for no reason.

<p>
I will share a little of my story (still too long) because I feel it
illustrates how bad mental health care contributes to the problems that
occur in AA.  I started off as a depressed teenaged non-drinker with serious
OCD-Pure that a very substandard mental health system basically threw their
hands up at in hopelessness.  I finally begged my parents for help but the
only Psychiatrist in town tried one lousy, ineffective, anti-depressant, had
NO CLUE what my OCD symptoms even were, then told me I should be happy since
I had a scholarship waiting on me at a university.  I couldn't live with my
symptoms, so I tried alcohol.  To make a long story short I made it through
college but started losing my self-medication battle in a major way after
the structure of school ended.  Psychiatrists I saw at that point decided
that I needed MAJOR anti-psychotics, since they said 'depressed people don't
drink' but bi-polars and psychotics do.  Those wrong medications nearly
destroyed what was left of me, I lost everything and drank more.  In the end
the goal of the doctors and my family was to keep me drugged and out of
sight.  Then I fell into the hands of a social worker who directed me to a
detox center.  I ended up in long term treatment (which was it's own cult,
long story) and AA.  People in AA accepted me as a fellow human being
despite my past, and I still doubt most people you meet can accept someone
once they find out they have been in mental hospitals and long term
treatment.  I stayed sober, became gainfully employed, married a guy I met
in AA and now have a decent life.  I KNOW though that I am lucky in ways
many are not.  My husband and I got together fairly early so I didn't suffer
as much of the 13 stepping as other women I know.  I also saw early on that
for my own sanity I needed to stay away from those wanting to more own
people than sponsor them.  The nasty sponsor women reminded me too much of
my emotionally abusive mother, and no matter how run down by life I was, I
wasn't putting up with that kind of abuse as a sober adult.  I think
'sponsorship' is a hateful business overall.  I also somehow gave myself
permission to find my own spiritual path via a lot of outside reading, and
that path bears little resemblance to the petty HP so many tout in the
rooms.  I don't believe that 'nothing happens in God's world by mistake'
because of human free will, unfortunately most AAs feel they have to buy
into this.  Buying into this wrote, elementary spiritual view does make AA a
religion for many, IMO, and contributes greatly to emotional misery within
the fellowship.

<p>
I am also damn lucky I lived almost 18 more years without any more than
psychological counseling for my depression.  At some point in the past few
years I decided that some of my thinking might not be good, perhaps the
SUICIDAL IDEATION part.  I had always told myself that if I ever drank again
I would have to kill myself because my only other choice would be to return
to AA as a has-been, nothing, someone who had lost all status and instead of
friendship and would now suffer pity and lectures.  I was afraid that under
such pressure I might just continue to drink and end up killing someone in a
car accident then going to prison for the rest of my life.  I would run this
scenario over and over in my head, and even tell my Psychologist that I was
perfectly justified in wanting to die immediately if I drank again so as to
avoid the horror of the inevitable.  When I read your quotation of Dr.
Vaillant's stats about a higher number of relapsing AAs committing suicide
than other alcoholics who fall off the wagon I wasn't at all surprised, I
KNOW what the thinking is, I know why they kill themselves, one drink and
you are a complete failure and to be scorned despite how many years you had
put into being a part of this recovery culture.  Depressed people who
self-medicated and ended up in AA probably are a very high percentage of
folks that relapse and kill themselves.
<p>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
Having such a bad experience with being over or wrongly prescribed by
Psychiatrists wasn't the only reason for not looking into medication for my
depression.  The other big reason was that I had heard so often in the rooms
the derisive comments made regarding taking anti-depressants.  AA was the
only place where I had been accepted and the only place I thought someone
with my past was acceptable.  I didn't want to give anyone any reason to
doubt my sobriety or my &quot;time&quot;.  When I got out of the half-way house at 1
year sober I got off my meds so no one would say I wasn't &quot;working a
program.&quot;
<p>
Then there was a death in my family last summer.  I didn't drink but inside
me I knew it was time to go farther in treating my original problem.  I
can't say how grateful I am that I took that step and went on
anti-depressant medication.  I see more clearly than I have at any point in
my life, this medication was a spiritual awakening of it's own.  It is no
longer a normal part of my life to think of suicide.  I was always afraid
people in AA would think I was a 'dry drunk' and needed more intensely
demeaning step work if they knew how depressed I tended to be.
I still choose to go to one AA meeting a week because some of the people
there are a big part of my life, but to me it was the good people that
helped my sobriety, not the cultish rhetoric most of AA consists of.  I also
know if the hard-liners take over every group in my area, I can leave and
survive sober.  I cheer for your site and others that are critical because
all experiences need to be heard.  All people with alcohol problems deserve
to live, not just the small percentage that stay sober in AA.  Looking back
I wish I could have held on and never taken the first drink to try to ease
my pain, I may have been able to have searched long enough to have found
real mental health care if I had stayed &quot;a good girl&quot; in the eyes of mental
health folks, but drinking limits one's options.  After one starts drinking
the diagnosis of alcoholism comes before anything else.  This HAS to change
or I don't see any progress happening in addiction treatment.
Will I always stay in AA?  I don't know.  There are people I love and don't
want to worry or let down by completely leaving.  There is a place in life
for some honest introspection even telling people to get out of their head
and into doing the next right thing.  I do, however, find I enjoy the
company of AAs who go to less meetings rather than more, (my husband is now
one of those, though he doesn't really admit it yet, LOL) people living life
not just pounding themselves for being human and worshipping some
&quot;sponsor&quot;.  I also find myself uncomfortable being a sponsor at this point
because the expectations placed on sponsors is that you will run someone's
life for them in every way.  I'm a great listener and shoulder to cry on,
but I'm not geared to be the perpetually angry bitch with a proverbial whip
so many new people are taught to seek.
<p>
Sincerely (and sorry for the long letter),
<p>
Mary

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mary,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and I don't mind the length at all. (We don't have to pay for
blank paper here.)  I'm glad to hear that you are doing well and thinking for yourself.
Congratulations on reclaiming your own mind.
I'm sorry to hear about the bad medical treatment that you got. Sometimes, even properly-trained
and educated doctors aren't very good.

<p>
The anti-medications bias of Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the worst features of A.A. I cannot
say how many people that has hurt, but I know it is a lot.
<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

<p>
Your links have not provided me any information about your life story of
alcoholism or addiction.  Nothing about your recovery.  Just all put downs
of AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Lisa,
<p>
Did you not read the web pages that I pointed you towards?
Let's try again: This is the biographical information:
<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="newwin59">Who are you?</a>
<p>
And I also pointed you to the story of the night I went into DT's,

<p>
And the story of my recovery is here:

</font>
<p>
Alcoholics and addicts are obssessed with drinking or using.  When they
recover &#8212; they must move their focus to another outlet.  For
*many*recovering alcoholics and addicts &#8212; the program of alcoholics
anonymous has
been a positive program &#8212; an outlet for focus.  It has had prodigious
results...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Please prove that statement. That is just standard A.A. propaganda, and Bill Wilson's boasting:
&quot;prodigious results&quot;.
(<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#prodigious" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
 There is zero valid medical research that agrees with those statements.


</font>
<p>
Instead of obsessing about the steps and program of AA &#8212; you have decided
instead to be obsessed with putting down and criticizing the program of AA.
And hey &#8212; if it keeps you sober &#8212; good for you.  I hope you have all the
serenity and peace in your heart from putting down AA &#8212; that myself and many
others have gained from active membership in AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Obsessing? It isn't me who has to go to meetings all of the time.
I go lay on the beach and take pictures of goslings.

</font>
<p>
Even if only 1 in 15 people get sober through the program of AA &#8212; it is
worth it.  B/C think of how many poeple are effected by that single persons
alcoholism.  So 1 person getting better ultimately in turns helps
many others get better.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Just because some people also go to some A.A. meetings while they quit drinking
does not mean that the meetings caused them to quit drinking.

</font>
<p>
<a name="dangerous"> </a>
Your obssessive web page is dangerous &#8212; I feel.  Have you heard of the story
of Audrey Kishline?  She wrote a book putting down the program of AA.  She
was even a guest on Oprah about her book.  She eventually drove drunk, hit a
vehicle head on and killed a 38 year old father and his 12 year old
daughter.  She spent 4 years in prison.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, yes, once again we have the standard A.A. declaration that
telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous is doing a great disservice to alcoholics
who are &quot;seeking sobriety&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin42">Here is the list of previous accusations</a>.

<p>
I not only know about Audrey Kishline, I met her at a SMART meeting. She went to SMART after 
she got out of prison. You do know, don't you, that she quit her own organization,
Moderation Management, and went and joined Alcoholics Anonymous?
After three months of A.A. indoctrination, she went on the
binge that led to drunk driving and killing two people. The A.A. program really helped her a
lot, didn't it?
<p>
Funny how the A.A. propagandists and apologists always fail to mention that Audrey Kishline
returned to A.A. months before her binge.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

<p>
I could not find your response, but it's late and I'll look later.  I did
see your quote of my letter, and I suppose you're drawing attention to the
fact that I said I'm not giving you a 100% pro AA story.  But then went on
to argue positive aspects of AA.  The truth is I haven't fully given myself
to AA, and at the beginning of AA meetings they do say that people who don't
make it are people who haven't fully given themselves to the program.  That
may or may not leave a battle of morals within me.  I don't know that I can
give myself fully to AA, I have my own religion, and while AA claims to
enforce the belief in God, there are many people there that don't believe in
God, and their are certain parts of the steps that conflict with my own
religious beliefs.  That is what I meant when I said I wasn't 100% pro AA.
I'm not.  All I am trying to do is stop drinking, so whatever I gain from
the program, or pick up there, is just ammo to stop drinking.  That is
something I can't do by myself as I've tried so many times.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Ted,
<p>
The response is an attachment. You may need to download it, or fetch it somehow,
depending on your email program.
<p>
I was not arguing with your statement that it wasn't &quot;a 100% pro AA story.&quot;
I was simply disputing some statements, like the one that follows.

</font>
<p>
Your statement that AA does not work seems to be based on the giving out of
coins for an area of Texas.  I've been there for the giving out of coins, I
never took mine, nor do I really care one way or the other.  I don't think
you can base statistics on coins when you don't know if members have stayed
in the same group over the years, moved, left AA entirely but not started
drinking again, or simply decided they don't care about the coin anymore.
As 30 years of sobriety is a gift in itself.  There are many people that
may have found better ways to live that do not include AA.  That being said,
if you're going to base you thesis that AA doesn't work, on the giving out
of coins, I think you'd better get some more reliable evidence.  That's
similar to figuring out how many people each soldier in the army has killed
in an enemy army based on the medals they have received.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The coins given out are only the tip of the iceberg. The decline in coins given
out as time passes is just one more piece of evidence.
I do not base my statement that A.A. does not work on just the count of coins given out.
There is much, much, more evidence that A.A. does not work, even statements from
&quot;the pioneers&quot; like Bill Wilson and his secretary Nell Wing and Lois Wilson's secretary
Francis Hartigan reporting on Bill and Bob's own calculations.
We also have the A.A. dropout rate. And we have the medical research that found
that A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking, and increased the death rate in
alcoholics.
<p>
Please read the entire file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
I listed all of that stuff in there.

</font>
<p>
Is AA a cult? It might well be, but I guess that depends on your definition
of cult.  I always thought of a cult as a group claiming to follow God that
would lead to ultimate violence and destruction for it's members.
Scientology, and a few others have that reputation, you know when the
members get hurt in the process?  You're saying AA doesn't work, and surely
you may say that the fact that it doesn't work is what hurts its members.
In other words, the people there are wasting their time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The definition of a cult is pretty well covered by
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>. Please read that, both the
questions and the answers for A.A. And you could go ahead and score A.A. on that test yourself,
and see what rating you come up with.
<p>
Not all cults worship God. Amway and Scientology do not.
Amway worships money, and Scientology worships power. And few cults actually end in
violence and death, only the most extreme ones. Some cult experts have calculated that there
are around 2000 cults active in the USA, and only a handful end in mass deaths and suicide
like Jim Jones' People's Temple or David Koresh's Branch Davidians. Nope, most cults
are quite happy to just continue exploiting the members and lying to them and promising
them a ticket to heaven.

<p>
And yes, people are wasting their time in A.A. But it is much worse than that.
When the A.A. members tell the newcomers to stop taking their medications, that often
results in psychotic breakdowns and hospitalization, and even deaths.
Other people are very damaged psychologically by the bad dogma and constant putdowns,
and have to spend years recovering from what A.A. did to them.

</font>
<p>
Personally, it helps me to remember what my drug and alcohol use has lead
to.  Even though I have brought myself into many low situations and remember
those situations at times, most of the time, I don't think about them, I
probably don't want to.  AA lets me see how drugs and alcohol has ruined
others lives, and what tricks and methods can be done to not drink.  It also
helps me to develop a support network of people I can relate to and share my
problems with, as nobody understands an addict, like another addict.  A
sober addict, mind you, I am not trying to hang out with people on their way
out the AA door, but people with time under their belt.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, drugs and alcohol can lead you to Hell. But that does not make A.A. good.
That's like saying, &quot;The Nazis are bad, very bad. So the Communists are good, because
they are opposed to the Nazis.&quot;
<p>
You are assuming that the A.A. oldtimers will give you good advice, and be good
examples. You should read
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="newwin77">the list of A.A. horror stories</a>
before you make that assumption.

</font>
<p>
I also enjoy group therapy, with one therapist you get 1 answer, and if that
answers sucks, you're out of luck, and you owe the therapist money.  AA is
free, and you get opinions of other people who have been through the same
hell you have been through and have survived.  I am not in AA to hear how
people have failed at the program, because people who have failed at it
aren't there.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I hear an assumption that &quot;the program never fails; people fail the program.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I am not saying you aren't right about it being a cult, I am not saying you
are wrong, I am saying you should get some better info on AA, it sounds like
you've made up your mind about a group you've never been involved with or
have ever attended.  If you had been in AA for a long time and it had
wronged you in some horrible way, I would understand.  But if you are only
speaking from attending a few meetings, taking a few notes to support a
theory you're already trying to prove in one direction, well, that's not
only in danger of being biased, but it's judgmental as well.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Better info on A.A.? Please, at least read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction</a>, and then realize that people
have been writing to me with their experiences and horror stories for 10 years now.
Yes, I've been to A.A. and N.A. meetings, more than I can count.

<p>
You are also accusing me of being prejudiced there: &quot;taking a few notes to support a
theory you're already trying to prove in one direction&quot;. No, I started out thinking that
A.A. was the biggest and best self-help group in America. Experience and direct observation
told me otherwise.
Please at least read the first few items of biography:
<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="newwin59">Who are you?</a>

</font>
<p>
Again, I am not in AA to fully submit myself to the steps, I have my own
religious beliefs, I am there to get help to stop drinking and using.  I am
not looking to spend the rest of all time praying to 12 steps written by
Bill W.  I am just trying to stay sober, as are most people in the program.
But if it is true what you are saying, that it does not work, that it is a
cult and a scam, and that rehab institutes are also scams, then what is an
addict like myself to do, since I have failed over and over again on my own?
Should I simply give up?  Not everybody is perfect when it comes to drugs
and alcohol, some people do indeed die.  What should I do?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I collected a list of helpful things, including letters from other people who
found happiness in sobriety. You can start here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

</font>
<p>
I will look for your response to my first letter, and then add more, but I
hope I clarified myself a bit better, I don't exactly know what else to do?
If AA is a dangerous cult scam, what are my other options?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, the response to the first letter is a web page that is attached to the email.
I always answer emails with web pages because then the links work, and I can both send
out the file and add it to the letters on the web site without putting together two
different answers.
<p>
Have a good day now, and I wish you success in staying off of alcohol.

Don't know if you've seen this. It's the claim in the first paragraph that
struck me.

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

In the 15 years since I quit drinking, I've neither spoken nor written those
words, and now, in doing so, I have more or less violated the
first-name-only tenet of Alcoholics Anonymous, the grass-roots organization
whose meetings have helped me (and millions of others) quit drinking. As
A.A.'s 11th Tradition states, &quot;We need always maintain personal anonymity at
the level of press, radio and films.&quot;

Millions of others?

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the link. That is really a puff-piece, isn't it?
Yeh, &quot;millions saved&quot;. Yep, A.A. solved all of our alcoholism problems,
and there aren't any &quot;practicing alcoholics&quot; left. Right.

<p>
Susan Cheever, who is heavily quoted as a real authority on Alcoholics Anonymous,
is the fawning sycophant who wrote
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Cheever" target="_blank">a biography of Bill Wilson</a>
that declared that it was really okay for Bill Wilson to be a sexual predator, and it was normal
for Bill to conduct s&eacute;ances and talk to the dead.
<p>
Here are some quotes from Susan Cheever:

<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Cheever1" target="_blank">necromancy and talking
to the dead in s&eacute;ances is perfectly normal behavior</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever4" target="_blank">philandering and sexually
exploiting women A.A. newcomers</a>
and lying about it
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever2" target="_blank">
isn't so bad either</a>.

<p><li>
Besides, Bill's sexual misbehavior and exploitation of sick women
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever5" target="_blank">should be a secret</a> because he's special....

<p><li>
Also look
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever3" target="_blank">here</a>,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever6" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever7" target="_blank">here</a>.
</ol>

<p>
So now they are talking about dropping the anonymity. Heck, they already have.
We all know when Mel Gibson or Tara Conner or Lindsay Lohan is going back into rehab again.

<p>
The nice thing about dropping the anonymity is that it will be easier to see how
many people do not get sober while doing the 12-Step dance.
When people's names are known, we can track them.
<p>
And that was actually one of the big reasons why Bill Wilson wanted the anonymity.
The Oxford Group had been terribly embarassed when their famous poster children
like Russel Firestone, son of the rich tire magnate Harvey Firestone, spectacularly
relapsed in all of the wrong high society places.
When Russel first got sober, the Oxford Group had publicized
the &quot;success&quot; for all it was worth, and bragged that the Oxford Group
spiritual cure for alcoholism worked great. Later, they regretted their loquatiousness.

<p>
So Bill wanted all of the alcoholics to be anonymous, and never
publicly reveal their membership in Alcoholics Anonymous.
That way, nobody could figure out how many A.A. members were
going back to drinking.

<p>
This should be interesting.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Hi, Terry, You recently mentioned your uncertainty regarding the pay status of
AAWS/GSO trustees. I asked a delagate about it a few years ago, and have copied
the relevant parts of our exchange.  The info he passes along, while often
favorably biased toward AA, generally seems accurate. Of course, some of the
names are no longer current. Mike

&quot;Thanks again. One more question, and I will put it to bed. Are any of those
fourteen paid positions you spoke of held by Class A or Class B Trustees? I
belabor this only to be accurate in the face of some misconceptions floating
around out there. Mike&quot;

<p>
to which he responded

<p>
&quot;No Mike, they are not. There are, coincidentally, 14 Trustees (7 Class A and 14
Class B) but as I stated before, they are reimbursed for their travel expenses
only. There are also 6 Non-Trustee Directors (3 AAWS, 3 Grapevine) who are
treated the same as Trustees as far as expenses and voting and no salary.

<p>
The current paid staffers (GSC voting members) are as follows:
<ol>
<li> Greg M &#8212; GM
<li> Adriene B &#8212; Staff Coordinator
<li> Mary D &#8212; CPC Desk
<li> Julio E &#8212; International Desk
<li> Irene K &#8212; PI Desk
<li> Mary Claire L &#8212; Group Services Desk
<li> Valerie O &#8212; Nominating
<li> Doug R &#8212; Conference Coordinator
<li> Eva S &#8212; Literature Desk
<li> Gayle S R &#8212; Corrections Desk
<li> Warren S &#8212; Treatment Desk
<li> Rick W &#8212; Regional Forums
<li> Robin B &#8212; Grapevine Editor
<li> Not sure &#8212; La Vina Editor
</ol>

<p>
I heard that they now have a La Vina editor or are getting one but don't know
the name. Tom Jasper was a voting member but his position was dissolved after
his removal. There is a strong movement to get rid of the Treatment desk. It has
become a useless waste of time and money, hardly receives any calls anymore and
could be easily placed under CPC. Hope this helps.&quot;

Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the input. Sorry to take so long to answer it. Somehow, it got overlooked
and buried. I just found it.
<p>
Yes, another correspondent also informed me that
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">the Trustees are not paid</a>.

<p>
Thomas Jasper was &quot;removed&quot;? How odd. I was just noticing in the Form 990's that
Thomas Jasper got $469,000 for just one year of being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot; (2008).
I wouldn't mind being &quot;removed&quot; like that.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#Form990" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
By the way, that is almost double what the General Manager and President
Greg Muth gets per year, $250,000. So that must have
been some pretty great advice that the Advisor was doling out.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hey, Terry, I noticed you still had this article up on your wishlist. The actual
magazine now sells for about $350, so you probably won't be receiving it anytime
soon, but here is an online version. Mike
