From:  	&quot;Taylor W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Tobacco, in relation to me, and to an old e-mail you received<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
Today is my first day tobacco free in quite some time. I don't recall how long it's
been since my last bid to quit. As you rightly pointed out, I let myself be
victimized by my lizard brain. And I'm not just cool with the idea of that little
fucker manipulating me. It's akin to a person letting their six year old child run
the household. As I said, I was concerned that my initial financial incentive to
quit smoking (that, plus your nudging when I e-mailed, is what got me to this
morning) would not hold fast. However, I've already come up with at least one
&quot;better&quot; reason not to have that first cigarette, and remembered another one, one
that has a lot of potential stopping power I've failed to make use of. Last night, I
had a hell of a time sleeping. That's not abnormal for me, what is abnormal, is
instead of their being no reason, or a loopy reason (like, circular fear, if there's
such a thing, I'm afraid of insomnia, which stresses me out, so I don't sleep), I
had a reason. I was hugely uncomfortable  with the idea of waking up with no
tobacco. Normally I keep at least five cigarettes ahead of actually running out. As
I lay awake in bed, I realized that seemed an awful lot like bondage. In that
moment, wasn't I like a junkie wondering from where their next fix may come,
lamenting that they hadn't been able to score earlier? The other factor, is that I
held my fathers hand while he died of lung cancer. Before that, I held his
cigarettes for him when he was too weak/drugged to smoke without assistance. While I
don't fear death in and of itself, some ways of getting to that end scare me. What
happened to my dad is scary, that's a shitty way to go, man. And that's even
considering the fact that he went on quite well given the spreading of the cancer,
etc. and really only the last 3 weeks or so were really bad. I feel it's worth
noting that my dad had just turned 51 two months prior to death, was a picture of
health. His cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, etc. were all excellent. But
none of that had a chance to be of any importance, since it wasn't long before the
fact that his body was rife with cancer took center stage.

<p>
Which brings me to the other tobacco related subject I wanted to touch on. Earlier
in this e-mail, I mentioned feeling like a junkie. That might sound extreme to some
folks, but really, the only difference are that my drug is much more socially
acceptable, and the buzz less enjoyable. I'm not sure how you link to specific
locations within pages, but I am referring to a letter you wrote in response to
<a href="orange-letters184.html#Kryssi" target="_blank">&quot;Kryssi&quot; on page 184 of your letters</a>.

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;You are obviously upset about the bans on tobacco and smoking around the world.
That really brings up a big philosophical question: Is any government entitled to
dictate what
the people may eat, drink, smoke, shoot, snort, or otherwise consume?<br>
If tobacco should not be outlawed, then what about poppy juice? Or marijuana?<br>
Or alcohol? Or coffee?&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Any government? I'd say a government with a totally socialized healthcare system
might be able to make an argument for legislating what people ingest. If the health
of every citizen is to be the burden of all, it could be argued that people have a
civic duty not to stress the government programs unduly by making foolish choices.
Still, it reminds me of a short story written by F. Paul Wilson called &quot;Lipid
Legging&quot;. Which actually involves a scenario very much like that, after alcohol and
tobacco were banned (in this speculative near-future), so were various forms of fat
(and I'm absolutely sure he meant to include high fructose corn syrup). This of
course, led to a booming black market in fresh eggs, real butter, etc. I guess my
concern, is that while I could see the governments point in such a situation, where
does it end? I mean, it seems like everyday something new is unveiled as being
loaded with carcinogens, like shampoo, or even the air we breath, so where exactly
does the legislation stop?

<p>
Personally though, I live the USA, and I feel that the smoking bans are horseshit.
Not only do they fuck with what the citizenry wants to do, it screws with the
sorta-free-market as well. I say let the dollars decide. Let individual business
owners make their own choices. Even as a smoker (hopefully reformed, here in a bit),
I would rather dine at a non-smoking restaurant. I do not care for smoking prior to
or after my meals. I'm fairly sure almost ANY nonsmoker would choose the non-smoking
restaurant. On the other hand, I think bars might see the opposite trend. Alcohol
and tobacco go together like poisoned peas and carrots. I always smoked heavier when
drinking (which eventually came to mean nothing, because if I wasn't at work, I was
probably drinking), and tons of folks seem to think it's a great idea to light up
even when they would not do so sober. Given my way, I would see an end to the
prohibition of all currently illicit or controlled chemicals/substances. I say go
back to the days when you could order heroin from Sears and Roebuck. The most
obvious issue is the violence that goes with the narcotics trade. Something people
are suddenly becoming more aware of, because the 24 hour news channels and some
newspapers decided to pay attention to what's been going on in Mexico. Also, this is
pure speculation on my part, but I'm not convinced (at all) that a higher number of
users results in a higher number of addicts by comparison. What I mean to say, is
that if you double the number of drug users, sure there will be more addicts, but I
don't think there would be twice as many addicts. I don't know too many folks who
are just dying to try methamphetamine, but don't solely on the grounds that it's
illegal. People who want to get high bad enough do just that. What I'm suggesting, I
guess, is the addicted population might be more static than most people think. Those
who are likely to become addicts are probably already using, or perhaps have managed
to actually get themselves addicted already.

<p>
I'd better stop there, I need to go get a workout in before I put my patch on and
I'm feeling fiendish.

<p>
Rock on man!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Taylor,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are quitting smoking. There suddenly seems
to be a lot of that going around. Good.

<p>
The question of government banning smoking if it is paying for the health care is a good one.
I remember Governor Jerry Brown complaining a bunch of years ago, something like,
&quot;Some guy smokes cigarettes for 20 or 30 years, until he gets lung cancer, and now he wants
me to pay his medical bills?&quot;
He certainly had a point.
<p>
On the other hand, since we do not have a government-funded single-payer health care system,
there is plenty of room to argue that government should not interfere in what it won't care for.
Prohibition of drugs has not worked any better than prohibition of alcohol did. Both of them
just made gangsters rich.

<p>
As far as taxing tobacco into oblivion goes, the last I heard on the
subject was that the taxes have reached the point of diminishing returns.
The taxes on cigarettes are so high that smokers are turning to the
bootleggers to get tax-free tobacco &#8212; buying untaxed cigarettes that are smuggled in
from North Carolina, which doesn't happen to have any cigarette taxes, since it is the biggest
tobacco-growing state in the country.
At that point, government actually loses influence over the problem.
<p>
Have a good day and a good healthy life.

From:  	&quot;Jim R&quot;<br>
Subject:  	your writings<br>

<p>
I stumbled on your stuff this morning.  It was good to find someone else who doesn't
swallow all the AA bullshit.  I have been sober over 20 years.  Living in a small
town, I run into people who I met in AA a long time ago.  I quit going in '93,
because I had my life back and because I couldn't take anymore of the constant
yammering in the meetings. What I see in the eyes of these AA people is pity.  Pity
because I have strayed from AA, therefore my life must be an unmanageable mess and I
must be drinking.

<p>
When I was going to AA, I couldn't believe how much time they spent attacking other
possible paths to sobriety, such as Rational Recovery, Moderation Management, or
just plain quitting.  When I would ask why they would oppose anything that might
help a fellow sufferer, or feel a need to be the only way, I got lambasted.  Since I
did not need their approval, I walked away.

<p>
The most useful thing that I ever read in my early years of sobriety was a short
article in my college alumni magazine that said that self-control, not self-esteem,
was key to beating addiction.  AA people over the years have criticized me for
describing myself by saying, &quot;I used to be a drunk, and now I'm not.&quot;  When told
that I'm supposed to say that I am &quot;recovering,&quot;  I tell them that it is my life,
and I can pick my own labels.  I tell them that the overwhelming majority of people
are not in recovery, have their own problems, and are probably sick and tired of all
the self-help bullshit that they hear everyday.  I only resort to the confessional
part when I have to, like when I have to explain the holes in my resume or my
divorce from a wonderful woman.

<p>
I particularly dislike the insistence that &quot;one day at a time&quot; means that it does
not get easier over time to stay sober.  It is a fear tactic to keep people in the
fold, much like the fear of hell.  When I tell someone in AA who is sober for a few
years that it does get easier, they look at me with bemused pity that I could be so
naive.  As though I am a fool who has not been to a meeting in eighteen years and
cannot realize that it is only dumb luck that I have not had a drink.

<p>
<a name="sponsor_drinking"> </a>
Many years ago, I ran into my AA sponsor at lunch when I was out with some work
colleagues. At the time, I had been sober about five years, and away from AA for
about three years. I had noticed that he and several other &quot;elders&quot; of our local AA
scene were drinking at a nearby table.  He followed me to the mens' room, and
launched into a confessional about how he had been drinking while he was my sponsor.
I shrugged my shoulders and told nim that he had helped me get sober nonetheless,
and had given me good advice, namely his admonition to forget all the baloney and
set a goal to simply not drink for an entire year.  He asked me why I was not upset
with his confession.  I told him that I had never looked at him as an idol or a mini
higher power.  He then launched into a windy explanation of why his drinking was not
hurting anyone.  I laughingly told him that I hoped that nothing about my reaction
to his confession conveyed any such judgment that his drinking was harming anyone.
Then I left.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jim,
<p>
Thanks for an interesting letter. You make so many good points,
ranging from the A.A. members pitying
you for thinking that it gets easier after a few years, to your sponsor drinking all along, and
rationalizing that he wasn't hurting anybody. (How about hurting himself?)

<p>
I don't want to be catty, but maybe it really doesn't get any easier for the people who
stay in A.A.  I noticed that A.A. meetings made me want to drink, and N.A. meetings made me
want to get high on dope. I'd be fine before I went to a meeting, but I came out thinking about
getting loaded. (I didn't, but I was sure wishing to. I could taste it. I could smell it.
It was really tempting.)
Other people have reported the same thing. Maybe staying in A.A. really does keep it from
getting easier.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and a good life.

Hello Orange,

<p>
Thank you for your reply to my recent note.  In it you asked me why I didn't
refer others to what I assume you feel are more effective methods in
addressing substance abuse.  The answer is simple; I had no knowledge of
their existence.  Furthermore I didn't see any need in looking for anything
else.  Although statically speaking AA does not work, it's working for me &#8212; 
for now anyway.

<p>
I've spent nearly all of my life in a small mid-western community and was
employed for more than 40 years by a Fortune 500 corporation.  It was that
company who pointed me towards AA via their Employee Assistance Program
(EAP) and the treatment center they referred me to:  Fact is they offered
nothing else!

<p>
Although AA's sixth tradition stipulates no alliances there seems to be a
couple not addressed in your papers; i.e. EAP, the judicial system and
treatment centers.  Is anything in the works?  Why aren't they pushing
people towards SMART, Lifering, Rational Recovery or any of the others you
mentioned?

<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
One thing I regret not mentioning in my previous note so I'll say it now:
Both Buchman and Wilson have provided millions of people a way to feel
better about themselves and their purpose, whether real or imagined.  And it
could be argued that everything is imagined.

<p>
Thanks for the response.
<p>
You say that you didn't refer people to other programs that work better than A.A.
because you didn't know that they existed. Well now you know. So what are you doing now?
<p>
Your statement that 

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Both Buchman and Wilson have provided millions of people a way to feel
better about themselves and their purpose, whether real or imagined.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


is false  &#8212;  a complete reversal of reality. Both the Oxford Group and A.A. made people
feel worse, and drove people to distraction, and
induced mental breakdowns, and even drive people to suicide.
They do not have a history of making people &quot;feel better about themselves&quot;.
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#wrecks" target="_blank">Clergy at Oxford University wrote</a>
about what Buchman's Oxford Group cult was doing to people there:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Very many touched by the Groups are touched only. They crash when the
influence of the Group is removed (as, for example, during vacation) and
they join the ranks of what has been described as the new Oxford problem
of the 'castaways.'&quot; &nbsp; ...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
With even more emphasis the Rev. Dr. Graham Brown, Bishop in Jerusalem, is
reported to have asked,
&quot;Is it any wonder that the clergy of Oxford
have to act as an ambulance corps to look after the wrecks of Buchmanism?&quot;
while the Bishop of Durham speaks of
&quot;the trail of moral and intellectual
wrecks which the progress of the Movement leaves behind.&quot;<br>

proved that A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
That is not an opportunity to feel better.

And then there is

That is not an opportunity to feel better about oneself.

Screen writer &amp; playwright Aaron Sorkin, the creator and an original writer of The

interview done years ago where he credited it for his own recovery. I use past tense

From:  	&quot;chad w.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	thankyou<br>

<p>
I am an atheist and a heroin addict of many years. I been through many
treatments and all have proselytized A.A.. I have tried to work the &quot;12
steps&quot; and have only found moderate, temporary success. I have, however,
found a few friendships through the A.A. program that I will always cherish.
<p>
In the area where I am from (toledo, ohio), meetings are traditionally ended
by holding hands and saying the lords prayer. This annoys me to no end, how
can a supposed open-minded organization, be so exclusionary in this day and
age, it boggles the mind. Yet, no one gets it, I seem to be speaking
gibberish when attempting to point out possible issues with the program.
 So
thank you for showing some common sense and giving the, unfortunately,
minority some hope that others too feel the same.
<p>
  p.s. I can't imagine some
of the mail you must get. It makes me chuckle just thinking about all those
officious, ignorant A.A. types getting all worked up about somebody actually
questioning their reasoning. When did seeking an open-minded education
become seemingly criminal?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Chad,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and thanks for the thanks. First off, did you know that you are living
at my birthplace? Toledo, Ohio. Yep. I don't remember a thing about it; my parents
were just there for a while.
<p>
About your last comment &#8212; &quot;giving the minority some hope&quot;. No way, Jos&eacute;.
We are the vast majority.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
The Harvard Medical School stated</a> that 80% of the successful
sober people do it alone, on their own, without any &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;support group&quot;.
The idea that &quot;most sober people&quot; do it with the 12 Steps is
just some of the A.A./N.A. cult propaganda.
<p>
The reason that it seems like Steppism predominates is because the self-healers generally keep
quiet and don't brag that they used to be an alcoholic or a drug addict and recovered without the 12 Steps.
(President Nixon isn't the only one with a &quot;Silent Majority&quot;.)
But the Steppers broadcast their propaganda very loudly, and often, everywhere they can, so
they create the impression that A.A. and N.A. are bigger and more popular and successful
than they really are.

<p>
Now it is true that the Steppers have taken over most of the rehab centers. There is plenty
of good money to be made by selling cult religion to the sick people. And addicts are easy
targets because they are sick and desperate and cloudy-headed, and it's easy to tell them
that they shouldn't criticize the quackery and superstitious nonsense
because &quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;

<p>
But even there, the times they are a'changin'.
Paul Roman and Terry Blum at the
Institute for Behavioral Research, Athens, Georgia,
did the <i>National Treatment Center Study Report</i> in 1996,
and they found that 93.1% of all treatment centers in the U.S.A. used
the 12-Step approach to treating alcoholism and drug addictions.
But when they repeated the survey in 2005, they found that only 75% of the treatment
centers used the 12-Step method.
(<a href="orange-letters217.html#NTCS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
That is a large change. 
A lot of treatment centers have abandoned the 12-Step approach because it doesn't work.
People are waking up.

<p>
Lastly, yes, I get all kinds of hate mail. Some of it is vicious, and some
of it is stupid, and some of it is downright funny.
The way that some people can curse a bunch of obscenities
while maintaining that they are much more spiritual than I am makes for
good stand-up comedy. George Carlin would have a field day.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Where did you find your sources? Many people say that this site is all lies.  I
think it is something that really needs to be proved or disproved.   Very compelling
information.

<p>
Nichole

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Nichole,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the question. I go out of my way to make sure that everything on
my web site is true. I research very carefully. It is not a pack of lies.
<p>
Right now, there are only two things that I am not sure about, and am questioning and
researching further:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Whether the A.A. Board of Trustees gets paid $70,000 per year, each.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<li> Whether only 2% of alcoholics possess
<a href="orange-letters225.html#Leu" target="_blank">a gene that appears to modulate the risk of
alcohol abuse</a>, like a reader recently wrote to me.
</ol>
<p>
Other than those two questions, I'm pretty sure that the rest of the web site is true and correct.

<p>
<a name="info"> </a>
I get my information from a wide variety of sources. First, look at
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">the bibliography, here</a>.
<p>
Then I use the public library system to get books and publications from all over the
country. They have a wonderful system of Interlibrary Loans (ILL) that has gotten me
rare books and articles from all over the country. In a few cases, they got me the <i>only</i> copy
of a rare old book that was available in all of the United States and Canada.
That is great for doing research on obscure old things like the Oxford Group.

<p>
I described that system
<a href="orange-letters209.html#Worldcat" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters215.html#Worldcat" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Then of course I use the Internet for research wherever possible. Again, between the
Internet and the public library system, an incredible number of databases are searchable
and retrievable.
<p>
Then, readers send me tips about where to look to find something more.
<p>
And readers occasionally send me their old A.A. books and magazines, and articles of interest,
and links.
<p>
And I'm always getting more books at used book stores.
<p>
It all adds up after 10 years.

<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Julian N.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Help Me<br>

<p>
My name is Julian and I am currently a &quot;member&quot; of AA. I am 23 years old. I
have been in and out of the program since I was 19 years old, court and
probation officer mandated back then. Voluntarily since 2009. My clean date
is 9-12-2009. I am sitting at LBCC right now and so on edge. I have been
going over your writings for days now. They have had a huge impact on my
mind and my current stance in AA. I am about to break down and cry because I
have been so manipulated by an old timing AA woman. I was led into a
marriage to her incarcerated son which started in 2007 and I married him in
2010 a day before he got sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. She had
convinced me to move into her house and continued to indoctrinate me for 8
months in her big books studies and her fascist way of looking at life, she
even tried to indoctrinate me into Christianity via the 12 steps. I filed
for a divorce in November and fled that house and everyone she knew. I even
moved out of the town she lived in. I have been angry, confused, frustrated,
ever since. What that women did was evil. She has so many of her little
cadets teaching what her sponsor taught her and has formed a kind of clique
via AA at their homes with their sponsees turning to Christianity and
becomming ordained in the 12 steps what she calls convicted. The more
convicted one is in those people's eyes, the more truth and spiritually they
have attained. The more a person &quot;seeks&quot; God and can articulate it, the more
successful they are in her eyes and her cronies eyes. She once called me the
poster child of AA, I was one of them. I saw the workings from the inside
looking out and now the outside. She is the least spiritual person I have
ever met.  She is lazy and insane, and did nothing but chain smoke and
enslave her husband and talk on the phone about how spiritual she was and of
course about AA. What you wrote about Bill W. being crazy fits her to a T.
AA is her life, she has even told me that it is God's will for her to stay
home and do nothing but read AA and Christian literature and go to groups
and have books studies, she thinks it is her purpose and I fell for that for
8 months of my life, I considered her a spiritual mentor and ended up going
to her church on Sundays and to meeting with her and enrolled in a marriage
counceling course with a pastor and his wife at her church. I am not even a
Christian. I started talking like her and believing everything she told me.
I was completely cut off from the outside world and outside perspectives.
She was cruel and filled with attitude when she talked to me sometimes, so
argumentative but I have a strong mind so I always argued back. I never let
my testing spirit leave although it did get covered up. I have noticed other
people in AA share this same kind of behavior that she showed although at
lower degrees, it is still there and it scares me.
<p>
 I haven't even gone to
get my 18 month chip because I don't know how to participate anymore. I have
made the decision to not work the steps even though I actually stopped in
October but have been lying to people telling them &quot;I'm just slow&quot; or making
up other excuses instead of the truth, that I don't believe the steps will
keep me sober, I already am sober and so no point in drudging up the past
like that. I did a lot of things that were unhealthy but I already know
that, so what's the point? I also don't believe in a monotheistic God, I
recently have discovered the joys of Eastern philosophy and am much happy
with that. I just keep getting the idea that when people say God they either
are talking about the &quot;christian&quot; God or they no clue what the hell they are
talking about they just blindly believe in it. My brain doesn't work that
way. I am too scared to share this news with anyone that I think AA is a
cult or maybe not even that far just that I have never really liked Bill
Wilson and I don't want to follow his 12 suggestions and I don't want to be
under the &quot;guidance&quot; of a group who has any form of social authority over my
mind. I recently shared some of the views I discovered at fellowship after
meeting at a pizza place a few days ago. A fellow member and my boyfriend
(who is also a member) both said &quot;The world according to Julian&quot; in a very
mocking way and laughed me off.
<p>
 I don't know what to do Orange. I am sly
enough to lie long enough until I move to San Francisco, but that is with
the AA boyfriend and I'm not sure about that. I'm into freedom and I feel he
may be too indoctrinated at this point to understand and accept my choice to
leave AA without leaving me. God forbid I end up a &quot;dry-drunk&quot;. Thank you so
much for creating your website and doing all of your research. Please help
me in that I need advice on how to proceed, who I can talk to, about what I
am going through. All of them just say find my part in it. I didn't sign up
to be manipulated or to feel how I feel. I signed because I needed to quit
drinking and get some healthy friends. They don't even feel like real
friends. It's all smiles and concern for an hour and then some food and
pictures and that's it. I don't believe this stuff to be spirituality
anymore. If you have any advice please share it with me as I am in dyer need
of some acquaintances who are not involved in AA as I am afraid that the
kind of behavior I explained above is more prevalent in this program that I
know about and will occur again in the future if I continue my membership.

<p>
Genuinely,
Julian L.

<font color="blue">
Hello Julian,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It's a great letter, and letters like this make me feel
very humble, because I'm not really a counselor, although I sometimes seem to get
shoved into the role.
<p>
I know that you are on the right track. You have already figured things out. You know
what the truth is, and you have wisely chosen to not continue with an organization
where people want to make you their slave. You are
just freaked out by idea of cutting all ties, and losing your social network, and
even your boyfriend who shows no signs of waking up.
The way that he put you down for voicing your opinion tells you that he doesn't
want you thinking independently. He just wants you to conform to the cult.
I know that you will be happier with somebody else who is willing to allow you
mental freedom, and who has genuine respect for your thinking.
<p>
But you are not alone. There are millions of us. It's just that we don't often get
together in groups. (That is just the natural consequence of thinking for yourself and
being independent.)

<p>
But there are groups. Here is my usual list of groups, organizations, and methods.
You don't have to practice any particular method to join the group and get some companionship
and counseling and comfort. After all, you are already sober. But it sure does help to
have somebody sane to talk to now and then.
So here are some suggestions:

I also lean towards the Eastern philosophies, so you get some sympathy there. When your
acquaintance and boyfriend mocked you for talking about such a philosophy, they revealed
that the &quot;religious freedom&quot; in A.A. is a sham. So is their &quot;spirituality&quot;.
They just want obedient conformists who repeat their favorite superstitions.
 I'm glad that you are going to leave them behind.
<p>
Remember that wonderful old maxim: &quot;Unto thine own self be true.&quot;
<p>
So have a good day now, and a good life, and get to work creating some new friendships and
relationships that are healthier and freer and more honest.

From:  	&quot;Daniel M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA and Catholicism<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I just stumbled on your site and I am quite interested in what you
have to say. I am in AA and have been two years sober, and have not
noticed a strong cultish tendency myself. I also happen to be Roman
Catholic, and one of the reasons I stay in AA is that I feel it is
quite compatible with Catholic beliefs and practices. Christians, too,
believe in surrendering one's own will to the will of God, as is
attested to numerous times in Scripture. Just look at the Lord's
prayer for one example &#8212; &quot;Thy will be done,&quot; or Jesus' prayer in the
garden where he says &quot;Not my will, but thine be done.&quot;

<p>
Also, I find the practice of confession to be quite healing. Such a
moral &quot;house cleaning&quot; is a big part of AA. I have found that being
rigorously honest and acknowledging my character defects has been
helpful for me. It keeps me out of situations that would cause me
anxiety, and thus lead to thoughts of drinking to quell the anxiety.
Having a clean conscience has been an invaluable part of my sobriety,
and also a key part to my practice of Catholicism.

<p>
Clearly there are parts of AA that are not compatible with
Christianity &#8212; the idea that one's higher power can be anything, even
an object or a group of people pops into mind. However, I have heard
many times about 12 step programs that we can &quot;take what we want and
leave the rest.&quot; I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on these
matters.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Daniel M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Daniel,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the question. It's a good question. My first reaction is,
&quot;If you like confession, then by all means go to the Church and attend confession. But there is
so much more to A.A. than just the confession routine. In spite of a few points of similarity,
A.A. is not a Christian religion.&quot;

<p>
First off, there is far too much negativity in Alcoholics Anonymous. The Catholic Church
will not tell you to do penance by doing 100 repetitions of the chant,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am stupid and sinful and weak. I must not
do so much stinkin' thinkin'. I cannot think for myself.
I cannot ever recover. Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.
I am stupid and weak and sinful and only want my own way about everything, and it will 
always be that way. I should just follow the orders of my sponsor.&quot;
</font>
<p>
The Church will not tell you that you cannot ever be reformed and made into a better, recovered person.
<p>
Then there are a zillion more problems with the A.A. philosophy.
The Church will not tell you to &quot;Let Go and Let God.&quot;
The Christian philosophy is, &quot;Get yourself straightened out and get to work. There is a lot
for you do do. Speak truth. Feed the children. Clothe the naked. Promote peace. Do not just
sit on your duff and wait for God to do it.&quot;

<p>
The Church will not tell you that you can worship any old God, anything you imagine: God, Jesus,
Golden Calf, tree, rock, bedpan, doorknob, Beelzebub, Satan, whatever you like.

<p>
Years ago, I wrote a web page that lists many of the conflicts between the Christian religion and the
Alcoholics Anonymous religion, here:
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.
<p>
Also see
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-rroot270.html#Cardinal_Hinsley" target="_blank">Cardinal Hinsley's criticism of Buchmanism (the A.A. theology)</a> and
<p><li>
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban" target="_blank">the Vatican ban on Buchmanism</a>.
</ol>

<p>
We also discussed the conflicts between A.A. teachings and the Catholic Church's teachings in
a couple of previous letters:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters33.html#Catholic_influence" target="_blank">Catholicism and A.A.</a>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters128.html#Catholic" target="_blank">a letter to Catholic Priests</a>
</ol>

<p>
Oh by the way, remember that when you are confessing things to your sponsor, you are not
confessing to someone who has taken a sacred oath to keep the confession confidential.
You get no such guarantee.
I have heard of several stories of ex-A.A. members discovering, much to their horror,
that their sponsors deliberately blabbed their Fifth Step confessions all over
town as revenge for them quitting A.A.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

<p>
Have you ever had a drinking problem and if so have you stopped? How?
<p>
Rick B.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rick,
<p>
Yes, I had a bad problem. I drank too much for nearly 20 years. And smoked too much
for 33 years. It got the the point where I was so sick that I was going to die. And I knew it.
I knew that time was running out. I guessed that I had about 3 years left to live.

<p>
And my doctor said so, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
<p>
I thought it over for another month, and got another case of beer, and drank on it, and thought
about it some more, and then finally decided to change my life and live.
<p>
Funny how that works. Previously, I had despaired of ever being able to just quit all of my bad
habits, and then, one day, I just did.
<p>
That was 10 years ago. I haven't had a drink or a cigarette or a hit of dope since.

<p>
The rest of the story is described here:
