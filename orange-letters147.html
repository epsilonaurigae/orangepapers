Subject:  	AA can be a dangerous place sometimes ...<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange,
<p>
 I don't know if you have time to respond to e-mails, and this story is
not unique, but I think it gets less press than dreaded tales of people who &quot;go out&quot;
and never come back.  I'm talking about old-timers who either don't want to or can't
fit in anymore, who are not drinking but are also not buying the whole cult thing
now that they've peered behind the curtain and glimpsed The Great Oz.

<p>
My husband and I have been sober for over 24 years.  We met when we were brand-new
and attending AA meetings in San Francisco, which of course is a notoriously
broad-minded city, making life-long friends in the Agnostics and Freethinkers Group
&#8212; probably just half a rung above the Satanists' Group (joke!) in general AA
acceptance, but it sure worked for us.  After moving to the Pacific Northwest and
living here for 16 years, we've tried to fit into AA with only limited success.
Even in San Francisco, we needed to shop around for meetings we liked, but here AA
is so influenced by fundamentalist religious beliefs and breast-beating that it take
more &quot;translation&quot; time than a U.N. session just to make people's baloney congruent
with my own experience.

<p>
Actually, I haven't been to an AA meeting since March this year, one or two days
after I was released from an emergency room for overdosing in a delayed-onset PTSD
suicide attempt.  Always a convincing sort, I wasn't kept in the loony bin (probably
should have been); instead they let me go home to be with my husband and see my
shrink.  I also went to my usual Saturday morning AA meeting, where the woman I was
using as a &quot;sponsor&quot; at the time (I now find the concept of sponsorship ludicrous
for people with decades of sobriety &#8212; exactly when do we get to grow up, anyhow?)
urged me to share my recent experience, so share I did, though I rambled and was
helplessly incoherent, clearly demonstrating the fact that &quot;putting the plug in the
jug&quot; isn't the whole answer.  I suspect my message was not terribly hopeful, and the
silence that followed it was deafening.  At the end of the meeting, someone gave me
a 24-hour chip as if I were a newcomer who had taken drugs for kicks instead of a
survivor of a suicide attempt and still on shaky ground.  My dad committed suicide
himself during my first six months of sobriety.  My shrink thinks there's probably a
family &quot;suicide gene;&quot; I hope to outlive it.  What an awful meeting.

<p>
My experience at that meeting left me feeling so betrayed that I haven't been back
to AA since, though some of my close friends still attend AA and I'm not averse to
the idea in principle.  I just find it a dangerous place for me and a particularly
&quot;slippery place&quot; in light of my PTSD.

<p>
I have found some encouragement in another organization, Dual Recovery Anonymous
(draonline.org), which in my opinion is more gentle than AA in addressing the
challenges and small victories of life with a substance addiction plus a brain
disorder (or mental illness, if you prefer &#8212; personally, I'd prefer to opt out of
the mental illness thing altogether if I could, but that's not happening).  Again,
only my opinion, but DRA like AA is limited by the constraints of the 12-step
paradigm and is challenged by the fact that it attracts so many people in very early
recovery from BOTH disorders.  Someone like me &#8212; sober but still crazy after all
these years, in fact crazier than I ever realized &#8212; can find themselves
uncomfortably elevated to a position of &quot;recoveredness&quot; undeserved in light of their
symptoms and the disaster their stone-cold sober life has become.  But it's better
than nothing, better than AA in my present fragile state.

<p>
<a name="dual"> </a>
I've read scholarly articles that say at least 70% of the people in AA are dually
disordered; that is, they have another brain disorder which is or (more often,
should be but isn't) being treated.  I used to get so tired of AA people who
congratulated themselves on not having taken so much as an aspirin in decades, and
now that I'm on a mood stabilizer, ADD medication, and an atypical antipsychotic
just to get out of bed without screaming at someone or harming myself (plus &#8212; gasp
&#8212; diazepam when I'm really freaked), I doubt AA's success in transforming mortals
into something wonderful or even interesting.  AA basically just gave me something
to do while I learned to stop drinking, and that was good enough, as drinking had
made my life an unrecognizable mess.  Even though my brain disorders play similar
havoc with my life now, I am still glad I have had enough practice not to have also
poured alcohol into the mix.  I was never a &quot;book thumper&quot; and never planned to make
AA my entire life, but I am glad I don't have to die a drunk.

<p>
Orange, I am amused but not terribly scandalized by the peccadilloes and worse of
the AA old-timers and big-timers (all very humble, of course) from Bill W. to the
present batch of sober rascals.  As my shrink says, for a group of people who claim
to have turned their will and lives over to a higher power, you could hardly find a
bunch of people more controlling than those in Alcoholics Anonymous.  And I might
add, steps or no steps, a bunch of people who are fundamentally less
self-scrutinizing.  I guess if we put Pol Pot on one side of hell's scales and the
average licentious 13th-stepper on the other, AA isn't all that bad ... but it's not
all that good, either.

<p>
Keep up the good work, would you?  It's very heartening to read the
counterpropaganda (hope you don't mind that characterization).  If you publish this,
can you try to delete any identifying information?  Not that I'm paranoid or
anything.  Thank you.

Hello [deleted],
<p>
Thanks for the letter. It says a lot. I especially like to get letters from
old-timers, because they <i>really</i> know the routine, and have been through
the mill, and have seen it all.

<p>
 And I do have some time to respond to emails, albeit slowly. I try to get to them

Have a good day, and a good life.

From:  	&quot;Karl R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Let's talk geese<br>

<p>
Orange, While I admit that I am hardcore AA, I must admit that I find a lot of truth
in what you say. Your research is absolutley stunning to say the least and I would
not hesitate to say that you know more about AA than most all umpteen million of us
combined. That leaves us at a stalemate when it comes to our views.

<a name="goslings1"> </a>
Therefore, I would like to talk about geese instead. First off, how did you develop this
interest? Secondly, do they migrate and return to you in the spring?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Karl,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and the compliments.
<p>
My interest in geese and ducks dates all the way back to childhood. I had many ducks
for pets when I was a kid. And my parents even got me a &quot;Chick-u-bator&quot;, that was
a little 2-egg incubator that actually worked to hatch out ducklings.
<p>
Then I was a biology major in college, which was kind of inevitable, considering my
childhood love of animals.
<p>
Here, I just took a liking to the resident geese, and got into the habit of feeding them,
and hanging out down at the river and working on my suntan and watching them.
And then when I found a family of orphaned goslings, I couldn't just leave them to
die and become cat food. So I entered into a whole new phase of the relationship.
<p>
Some of the Canada Geese do migrate, and some don't.
Canada Geese are funny that way. Most wild birds
have a migration path embedded in their brains, and they are born knowing where to go.
But not Canada Geese. They learn from their parents where to go. And if the parents don't
teach the youngsters where to go, then they don't go.
<p>
That is how the resident flock in Portland got started. About 30 years ago, some
geese were migrating through, and there was a female with an injured wing who couldn't
go any further. Since Canada Geese mate for life, her husband stayed with her.
They thrived here.
<p>
There is an island in the middle of the Willamette River called
Ross Island that is basically just a giant sand bar, and part of it is a wildlife
refuge. It is completely cut off from the mainland &#8212; there is no bridge or road
that goes to it, so the geese and other wildlife have a perfect
place to nest, where dogs and cats cannot raid
their nests.  The island also hosts a Great Blue Heron (I call him &quot;Beethoven&quot;),
some Ospreys, a couple of Eagles, and beavers and racoons, and who knows what else.

<p>
So the geese raised a bunch of babies that don't migrate. Then those babies grew up
and produced more generations of geese that don't migrate. And then other migrations
left other geese here, so the flock grew. Now it's quite a mixture of resident
geese and visitors. Last year we even had three &quot;Cackling Geese&quot;,
which are a very small variety of Canada Goose. It's the same species, but
is a variety adapted to life in northern Alaska, where the harsh conditions only support
small geese. Well, three of them decided that they had had
it with freezing their butts off in Alaska, and they stayed here for the summer,
sort of like old people retiring to St. Petersburg, Florida.
<p>
Still, many of the geese do migrate and come back.
Some fly all the way to Mexico for the winter, and then return.
Also, in the spring and fall, we get a lot of stop-overs. They are basically
wild geese, but they are tame enough to land and join the flock here, and
rest and feed and get ready for the next leg of their journey.
Some mornings, I've found 150 geese in the field here.
<p>
One Sunday morning,
a couple of brown geese showed up &#8212; a completely different species, maybe
Bean Geese &#8212; very rare here &#8212;  and
they were so wild that when I threw bread to them, they thought I was throwing
it <i>at</i> them, and they ran from it. They were so wild that they had never
seen bread before.  They were also very afraid of me,
and kept the whole flock of geese between me and them. Still, they would not
leave the flock and fly away. The instinct to stay in the flock is that strong.
They watched what the other geese were doing, and gradually started nibbling at
bread, copying what the other geese did.
<p>
What is funny is that some of the geese here
migrate to an island in the Columbia River that is called &quot;Sauvie Island&quot;.
It is only 10 or 15 miles from here, as the goose flies. It's about the laziest
migration around.  Why they chose to summer in Portland and winter on Sauvie Island
is beyond me.

<p>
But some geese just stay here all year around.
It's not too hot in the summer, and not too cold
in the winter, so they don't really need to migrate.
<p>
Last winter was unusually harsh. We had a heavy snow storm and then a cold snap that
kept the snow on the ground for a week. The snow usually melts off in a day or so,
but not last winter. So the poor geese and ducks couldn't get anything to eat because
everything was covered with snow and ice. So I took rice and oatmeal to them.
There were about 100 birds that stood in a field and waited for me &#8212; about 30
or 40 geese, and a bunch of ducks and Sea Gulls.  It's quite a sight, seeing
a hundred of them expectantly waiting for you, hoping that you will bring them
something to eat.

<p>
<a name="Fly_Away_Home"> </a>
By the way, speaking of migration, perhaps you saw a movie called &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;.
It's not a great movie, but it's entertaining, and basically true. Catch it on late-night
TV if you can.
It's about a girl who lived on a farm in Canada with her artist father who loved to
fly an ultra-light airplane.  She found a clutch of Canada Goose eggs that were orphaned
because the mother got killed by a falling tree.
She took the eggs home, and when they hatched out, the goslings accepted the girl
as their mother.
<p>
Everything was fine until it came time to teach the youngsters to migrate.
The local official wildlife manager was hassling the girl and her father
about having wild geese who didn't
know where to go, and it seems that Canadian law dictates that such birds shall
have their wings broken so they can't fly. Well of course the girl wanted to
save her babies from such a fate.
<p>
At the same time, there was a wildlife refuge in North Carolina that had no wildlife.
Yes, strange but true. The land was about to lose its wildlife refuge status and
get bulldozed and developed. Ecologists wanted to save the land as a wildlife preserve.

<p>
The girl decided to take her birds south to the unpopulated wildlife refuge.
The father came up with the bright idea
of getting the girl her own ultra-safe easy-to-fly ultra-light,
and then the father would fly south,
and the girl would follow her father, and the geese would follow the girl.
Thus the geese would learn from their &quot;parents&quot; where to migrate.
<p>
It worked. Her brood of young geese adopted the wildlife refuge as their winter home,
so the wildlife refuge had some wildlife, and the geese had a migratory path.

<p>
That story got around in wildlife management circles, and it is now a common technique.
I was just reading about some guys who are using ultra-lights to lead endangered
species of cranes on migrations.

<p>
So the current wildlife management techniques for teaching endangered species of birds
where to migrate were actually invented by a wacky artist living on a farm in Canada,
and his daughter who was the mother of a bunch of goslings.

<p>
Have a good day.

<font color="blue">
Hi Ted,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I don't think you have to be afraid of the 12-Step program,
if you don't believe it.  Don't take it seriously, don't believe the nonsense they
spew, and don't be down on yourself.
<ul>
<li>
When they tell you that you are powerless over alcohol, don't believe it.

<li>
When they tell you that your fate is &quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot;, don't believe it.

<li>
When they tell you that you must do the 12 Steps, or else bad things will happen to you,
don't believe it.

<li>
When they tell you that you are insane and selfish and sinful and full of moral
shortcomings and defects of character, don't believe it.
<li>
When they tell you that only God can save you, don't believe it.

<li>
When they tell you that A.A. is &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;, don't believe it.

<li> And so on, and so on...
</ul>

<p>
You can resist 12-Step indoctrination in the same way that you can resist brainwashing
techniques.  Did you know that brainwashing actually fails almost all of the
time?  During the Korean War, the Communist indoctrinators used their
 brainwashing techniques on tens of thousands of American, British, and
 other United Nations prisoners of war for years, and only got 16 to defect.
<p>
Read the short web page on 
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Berkeley Revive's description of common cult characteristics</a>s.
It starts with a description of the brainwashing techniques that Doctor Robert J. Lifton
identified, that the Chinese Communists used on the prisoners &#8212;
the &quot;Eight Conditions of Thought Reform&quot;.
<p>
Memorize that list, because it will be very handy for seeing people trying to use
those techniques on you.  When you see it coming, and know what they are trying
to do with your mind, it won't work.

<p>
The other two short pages of descriptions of cult characteristics are also
quick reads:

Sober 9 years. The meetings helped me at first, but the bullshit

probably the most positive things but theres too much of the other.  I

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
Hi,
I am the product of an alcoholic family. Both parents. Both sober. One 37 years and
an ardent believer in AA. The other not a believer in AA. My on again off again
relationship with a so-called alcoholic who has now been sober 60 days in the AA
program with some very strange results in regards to his attitude toward me, has led
me to Google questions. This is how I came upon your article &quot;The Other Women&quot;.

<p>
I am an educated middle aged woman. Divorced, completed my BA in history at 47 while
raising two children. Employed as a bartender because that pays the bills better
than a teachers salary which I went to school for. Own a home I worked and paid for
and since my divorce over ten years ago seem to be getting involoved with the same
type of men.  Just a little backround for you. I am an EXTREMELY honest person who
at this present time is seeking facts to make decisions. I Googled A. Orange and it
led me to this e-mail.
<p>
 I want to know who you are, why
you are against AA and what alternatives you are suggesting. Actually more to the
point do you think drinking &quot;too much&quot; and ruining your life is just an excuse for
more in depth problems. I cannot find information about this group or person
whatever the case may be. It seems you want to discredit AA which has made my Dad's
life work. I have no problem with the truth but I want to know if you have an
agenda which it seems that everyone does these days. Thanks for your being candid
in advance.
<p>
Sincerely<br>

Hello Kristi,
<p>
Thank you for some honest questions.
<p>
Who am I? I answered that question a bunch of times, so I'll point you to
the list of answers,
<a href="orange-letters136.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
We have also talked about what works for getting sober, and what I recommend,
and what other people recommend, many times,
so I'll point you to the list,
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
The assumption that A.A. worked for your father is just that &#8212; an assumption.
It is good that your father got sober, but it's an assumption that A.A. "worked" or
made him do it.
If A.A. really worked to make people get sober, it should have a much higher
sobriety rate than it does. The actual success rate of A.A. is nothing more than
the success rate of people who get no help or treatment at all.  A.A. makes no
difference, other than causing problems for people, and raising the death rate
and the suicide rate.
<br>
<a name="rlcs"> </a>
<p>
There is zero evidence that the A.A. program helps alcoholics.
Rather, the evidence is that the A.A. program does serious harm to
alcoholics. Involvement in A.A. has been shown to:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raise the rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">raise the rate of rearrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">increase the costs of hospitalization later</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<li> And although this has not been formally tested and measured,
the evidence is growing that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">A.A. also raises
the suicide rate in alcoholics</a>.
</ol>

<p>
And <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">look here</a>
 for the dropout rate shown by the sobriety coins that are given out.

<p>
And for all of the information on the effectiveness of 12-Step-based treatment,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">look here</a>.

<p>
Now I'm glad that your father is in good health and that A.A. did not drive him to
relapse or suicide. But that does not mean that A.A. is good for other people.

<p>
Now, for your last and best question:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Actually more to the point do you think drinking &quot;too much&quot;

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, I would change the words &quot;excuse for&quot; to &quot;sign of&quot;, but the answer is
 &quot;Yes, very much so.&quot; We have talked many times about how excessive
drinking is often just a sign of underlying mental or emotional problems.
 Many doctors regard drug and alcohol abuse
as a sign of underlying mental problems that must be dealt with to solve the
drug/alcohol problem.  That's why, when people ask me what will help them to stop
compulsive drinking, I tell them to see a real doctor and find out whether they
have something like a bipolar disorder that can &#8212; and should &#8212;
 be treated with medications.

I've read scholarly articles that say at least 70% of the people in AA are dually
disordered; that is, they have another brain disorder which is or (more often,
should be but isn't) being treated.

 majority of A.A. members had mental problems. Look

Subject:  	a question<br>

<p>
Hello orange,
<p>
I'm just wondering.... If you say that the 12 steps are so destructive and
that aa is a cult, how do explain the thousands of people, including myself,
who have recovered from alcoholism and are living happy lives through the 12
steps? And what about the principal of attraction rather than promotion, do
you mention that in your site?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Caitlin,
<p>
The answer is simple:
<p>
<ol>
<li>  Out of the many millions of people with drug and alcohol problems,
there were some millions who were going to quit their bad habits and recover their health.
So they did.
<p>
<li>
A small percentage of those recovered people got conned into joining cult religions.
Some joined Scientology, some the Moonies, and some Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<li>
Then all of those cult religions claimed that they had saved the lives of
their new converts, and bragged that they had the answer to drug and alcohol problems.
Scientology sells &quot;Narconon&quot;, the Moonies sell Rev. Moon, and Alcoholics Anonymous
sells the 12 Steps.
</ol>

<p>
I have often mentioned, and discussed, the hypocrisy of
the  &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot; line.
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>
<p>
<a name="killing"> </a>
I believe that your site is killing people. When I google something for aa,
your site is the first that pops up. That must also be true for the
suffering alcoholic who googles aa.
<p>
<font color="blue">
There is no evidence that telling people the truth about alcoholism and Alcoholics
Anonymous kills them. The evidence is that it helps them.
</font>
<p>
 That is very sad that you clearly have
dedicated your life to proving that aa is destructive. Because the truth is
that many, many people who have lived in hell through their alcoholism have
found great solace through aa and perhaps they do not stay sober forever and
do not become perfect people, but they have periods of happiness and
sobriety.
<p>
<font color="blue">
So people feel better when they are not drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.
That is true, but that has nothing to do with Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. does not reduce drinking.
</font>
<p>
Why would you want to stop something that has saved many lives?
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. does not save lives. In fact, an A.A. Trustee, Dr. George E. Vaillant, found
that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
 A.A. increased the death rate in alcoholics</a>. No way of treating alcoholism
produced a higher death rate than A.A.
</font>
<p>
Please know that your work is keeping people sick.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, it isn't.
</font>
<p>
 The only thing you are
doing is giving a pat on the back to people who have not found aa helpful.
The trade off of keeping people from something that may help them versus a
pat on the back for bitter people who did not find aa helpful.
Being a member of AA is a choice. That is one of the principles of this
program. I, and everyone who is a member that I know has a choice about
being a member.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you have a choice of which group or religion you join. But that does not
in any way indicate that the group is good or helpful to others.
</font>
<p>
My life has gotten infinitely better since I became a member of aa.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Translation: your life has improved since you quit drinking alcohol.
<p>
How great would your life be if you faithfully practiced the 12 Steps and then
drank a fifth of whiskey every day?
</font>
<p>
It is terribly sad to me that you have dedicated your life to discrediting a
movement that has saved thousands of lives.
<p>
<font color="blue">

Only &quot;thousands&quot;?  A.A. routinely claims to have 2 million members worldwide.
And now you are claiming that A.A. has only &quot;saved thousands of lives&quot;?
 That makes the odds of A.A. saving the life of a member only one in a thousand.
That is an extremely high failure rate.
<p>
Oh, and A.A. is not &quot;a movement&quot;. It's funny how every cult that comes along
labels itself &quot;a movement&quot;, and claims that it is a new wave, sweeping the world.

</font>
<p>
What is even more sad is the thousands of people who won't have a chance at
sobriety and a new life because they find your wild interpretation of the 12
steps before they make it to a meeting.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, the people who are sick with alcohol abuse or alcohol addiction have plenty
of chances to quit drinking.  Not only is A.A. not &quot;the only way&quot;, A.A. is actually
one of the worst ways.  Look here for a chart of what works:<br>

http://www.behaviortherapy.com/ResearchDiv/whatworks.aspx</a>
<p>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.<br>
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.

</font>
<p>
I hope you realize that your bad experience in aa is killing people.

<p>
Hi Kristin,

<p>
I recently came across Orange's papers and your interest in stories
about AA.   I have spend 35 years mostly in, but sometimes out, of
AA.    I have been to a couple of rehabs and outpatient treatments.
As a successful biomedical scientist, over the years I have become
convinced that the basis of alcohol dependency is biological, most
recently supported by Spanagel's thorough review (Spanagel, R.
Alcoholism: A Systems Approach from Molecular Physiology to Addictive
Behavior.  Physiological Reviews 89:649-705, 2009).

<p>
<a name="medications"> </a>
Unfortunately, when I became overwhelmed by my alcohol problem AA
was the only game in town (1975) and so I matriculated through the
&quot;program&quot; for a few years.   At about the same time I was diagnosed
with Bipolar Disorder by a competent psychiatrist and I was treated
with the drugs available at that time, lithium and antidepressants.
As I was being treated for my bipolar disorder I mentioned this in
meetings and although I naively did not understand it at the time, I
was chastised and told to not take those medications, God would heal
me.   This actually was supported by a psychologist who was in AA.
This psychologist subsequently lost his license.  He used to tell me
to &quot;get on my knees&quot;.   However, because I did not especially care
for the side effects of lithium and secondary to AA's advice I went
off my medication.   It is true that early on people are often
desperate and they will latch onto anything that professes to provide
some help and comfort to them.   AA does a good job at that because
one is told that its not their fault,  they have a &quot;disease&quot;.

<p>
I am convinced at this point in time,   literally 3 decades
later, that my bipolar disorder is my primary disease and that my
dependence on alcohol was secondary to the bipolar disorder.
However,  owing to AA's brainwashing I tended to stay away from the
idea of a mental disorder since I was told my alcoholism was a
disease I was powerless over, I was insane to begin with and I drank
because I was morally defective.

<p>
Over the years I had relapse after relapse and of course on returning
to the cult each time I was berated, shamed and instilled with self
loathing because I didn't &quot;work the program&quot; properly, &quot;I wanted to
be drunk more than I wanted to be sober&quot; etc, that I needed a better
sponsor etc.   All that time, and I did not realize it,  my bipolar
disorder was smoldering and erupting from time to time and so I would
tend to medicate it with alcohol.   Given the horror show I went
through and put my family through over the years, on reflection it
is remarkable that I have been successful in my profession.  Actually
I can attribute a major part of my professional success to the fact
that I am bipolar, as are a lot of people I work with, many of whom
are also chemically dependent.

<p>
Within the last couple of years I unfortunately got a DWI and as
part of that scenario I had to go to a rehab which of course charged
thousands of dollars to once again indoctrinate me with AA
nonsense.   We had to attend workshops on powerlessness,
spirituality and listen to NA or AA &quot;recovering&quot; speakers drone on
using the most vile language one can imagine.    The only positive
thing I got out of that rehab (other than keeping a judge happy) was
that an astute addiction psychiatrist revisited my bipolar
disorder.   Subsequently I was put on a couple of newer drugs for
mood stabilization and depression and lo and behold!   I am
recovered!   No problem with alcohol, no craving, and I feel great
and life is good.    So after coming out of rehab I went to
outpatient (another legal requirement) and of course AA is mandated
so I went back to my old meetings and of course I was vilified and
berated and &#8212; no surprise, once again I was told to get off my
medication, that I didn't need those drugs because God would keep me
sober.   At this point I began realizing, with a stable mind thanks
to those drugs, that there was something wrong, terribly wrong with
this picture.     So I began perusing the internet and practicing
extreme detachment from AA.   My sponsor and &quot;friends&quot; kept calling
and I would not answer their calls.    In addition I began going to
SOS meetings and to my joy I discovered rational thinking people who
did not spew out mindless babble and spout inane slogans at me.
Moreover, the one SOS meeting I go to is attended by a lot of people
who have bipolar disorder and other mental health issues and its
great to be with them and to actually be helped by these groups.
So in my case anyway my alcohol dependence was clearly related to my
underlying mental disease which is truly a disease, unlike
&quot;alcoholism&quot;.    I believe my bipolar disorder was there first as
bipolar disorders are entirely of genetic origin..

<p>
<a name="naltrexone"> </a>
I of course am furious that I and my family had to suffer for
years and years because of AA indoctrination.    Along the way in the
past few years I also tried Doug Krotzers's program
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221840/http://www.alcoholismcure.org/" target="_blank">
 http://www.alcoholismcure.org/</a>
with zero success.   They use nutraceuticals
in their program &#8212; Kudzu, 5 HTP, St John's Wort as a naturopathic
approach. I tried this program because it is based on a biological
cause, which appealed to me.    He claims great success,   I cannot
support that.   In addition to AA , a program like Krotzer's with no
bona fide medical support is dangerous because of situations similar
to what happened to me.    There are alcohol dependent people with
significant mental disorders similar to mine and people with major
depression etc that simply cannot respond to herbal treatments etc.
(or to AA idiocies).   There are a lot of new science based treatments
for alcohol dependence out there these days including acamprosate,
naltrexone, and topiramate that can reduce or stop drinking.   Again,
discussing these kinds of treatments with AA people gets one
nowhere.    I almost get the feeling that these &quot;old-timers&quot; have
spent so many years wasting time at meetings and exerting power over
people, that they resent these new treatments because they think
everyone has to do what they did to get sober.

<p>
So I hope my story is of some use to you in the book you are
putting together.   I think the two major lessons I have learned from
35 years of difficult experience is that the basis of alcohol and
drug dependence is biological,  nothing else.   Not spiritual, not
moral defects, but biological.  There is an environmental component,
an abused child as I was will be more likely to drink, especially if
the genes are there.  Of course with respect to the latter,  I have
been told in AA that I did not drink because my father abused me, I
drank because I am an &quot;alcoholic&quot;  !

<p>
As Rabbi Harold Kushner said after studying the Holocaust, &quot;God is
not omnipotent&quot; God will not stop the safe from falling on your head
and God will NOT keep me sober.

<p>
If you haven't seen it Penn and Teller's Bullshit series did a
program on AA and the 12 steps:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221840/http://www.blinkx.com/video/penn-teller-bullshit-12-stepping/_R4YPBfLS7sXY1H_F8dmLA" target="_blank">
http://www.blinkx.com/video/penn-teller-bullshit-12-stepping/_R4YPBfLS7sXY1H_F8dmLA</a>
<br>
  Its pretty good.

<p>
The second lesson is that AA is dangerous.

<p>
Sorry for the length of this email but once I get started its
difficult to stop.   I have many more stories.

<p>
On your page:
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-secrets.html" target="_blank">
  http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-secrets.html</a>

 you claim AA
success rate is less than zero.

<p>
If 100 people go to AA to get sober and all 100 get drunk, that is a success
rate of zero.  How can the rate of success be calculated as less than zero?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anon,
<p>
Thanks for the question. The answer is simple: The success rate is not calculated
against zero recoveries, it is calculated against the recovery rate of untreated
alcoholics, who have about a 5% per year spontaneous recovery rate.

<p>

<table align="center" width="90%" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="3">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">
<i>It's like this:</i>
<p>
Imagine that there is a nasty disease that kills 50% of the people who get it.
A pharmaceutical company has a new medicine that they want to test.
So they give the drug to a bunch of the people who have the disease, and 50% of them
get better.
<p>
The drug manufacturer cheers and brags,
<font color="#5f009f"><i>
&quot;Look at how great our new medicine is!
We saved half of the patients!&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Wrong. The new drug saved nobody. The half who survived were the ones who were going
to survive anyway. The drug had an effective zero percent cure rate, above and
beyond normal spontaneous remission.
<p>
To compute the success rate of any medicine or treatment program, you have to subtract
the normal rate of spontaneous remission from the apparent success rate.
In this example, fifty percent minus fifty percent yields a zero percent success rate
for the new medicine.
The new medicine didn't <i>make</i> anybody recover.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(And if the survival rate of the patients who were taking the new medicine
was less than half, then the new medicine was actually poisoning people
and keeping them from recovering.)
</font>
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>


<p>
When A.A. was put to the test, A.A produced these results:

<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. raised the rate of binge drinking</a> in alcoholics, more than the bingeing of untreated alcoholics.
That is a negative success rate.

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">A.A. raised the rate of rearrests</a> over that of untreated alcoholics. 
That is a negative success rate.

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">A.A. increased the costs of hospitalization later</a> over those alcoholics who were hospitalized immediately, rather than
being sent to A.A.
That is a negative success rate.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. raised the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
That is really a negative success rate.

I'm going through a little bit of an obsessive phase here but thought this

Hi again, Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the laugh. And that image is something else. I don't know if I
should laugh or cry.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange,

<p>
You might remember this incident from a few years back. Will Beebe &quot;apologized&quot; to
Liz Schimpf (now Liz Seccuro)
for an attempted rape 21 years before. I haven't seen much of this after the first
few news stories. It might be worth looking into just for informational purposes.

http://www.readthehook.com/Stories/2006/01/12/coveriHarmedYou21Years12St.html</a>

<p>
I checked Law.com for document relating to this particular incident. I only did a
quick search and didn't find anything. There's is reference to yet another incident
in the article above that do have documents relating to it.

Hi Sherp,
<p>
Yes, I remember that story. It became old news and got forgotten real fast.
It never got much play. I'll have to check that out further.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Thankyou<br>

<p>
Hello there. I hope this e-mail finds you well and happy.

<p>
What a pleasant distraction from the monotony of most other recovery/addiction
affiliations I have had the misfortune to come across. I am an inner city, lower
class by-product of alcoholic role-models, I have very little experience of state
education but after 40 years on this earth I have gained my own education. I have
been in many prisons in England and 4 treatments centers &#8212; none of which worked as I
did not want to stop using!!  At the ripe old age of 40 I decided enough was enough
and decided to get and stay clean.
<p>
 I am very intrigued by your web-site and the
findings you recorded. When all is said and done the bottom line is that I stopped
using when I had had enough of the delusion &#8212; end of story!!!
 I am neither anti 12
step nor pro 12 step. I am a firm believer in self empowerment and self belief. I am
writing to say thank you for the information on your website. As a human being I
strongly believe that we all have the capacity for change and that all the
theorizing in the world will not stop ones addictive habits. The individual will
stop when they are ready. Those who end up dying from this do so of there own free
will. I am yet to meet someone who convinces me otherwise. If I ever do ill let you
know.
<p>
Freedom of choice is one of the human races greatest assets. Your website
encouarages me to make my own mind up and recover of my own accord.

<p>
Thanks again for information

<p>
Long may you run

Hi Zepp,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.

<p>
I agree with your viewpoint. I finally quit drinking
 when I was sick and tired of suffering so much,
and wanted a better life.  Actually, a doctor helped a lot. After questioning me
about all of the bad aspects of my drinking, he said, &quot;Quit drinking or die.
Chose one.&quot;
<p>
I thought it over for a while and decided to live.

It's both funny and appalling that I actually had to think it over.
That really is a good example of alcoholic thinking.
<p>
It reminds me of a joke from Jack Benny. Benny had a stage persona where he
was the world's stingiest miser. In real life, he was actually
 quite generous and gave a lot to charities.
 But on stage, he could quibble and argue endlessly over a nickel.

<p>
Jack Benny told this joke:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
A mugger held him up in an alley, and stuck a gun in his ribs, and said,
&quot;Your money or your life!&quot;

<p>
There was silence.

<p>
The mugger grew impatient, and said, &quot;Come on, hurry up! Your money or your life!&quot;

<p>
Jack Benny said, &quot;I'm thinking, I'm thinking.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, alcoholics can be like that when it comes to deciding whether to quit drinking.

<p>
I notice how the doctor didn't recommend any program, or say that I had to
believe anything, or go to any group, or anything.
 And he clearly said that it was a choice, and that I had a choice,
and I could choose.
And that I had to choose.
<p>
So simple.
<p>
Have a good day and a good life.
