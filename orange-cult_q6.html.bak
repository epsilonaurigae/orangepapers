And the Rajneeshees raved that Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh was actually God Himself returning to Earth in Poona, India &#8212;
&quot;Bhagwan&quot; is actually a title that means &quot;embodiment
of God&quot; &#8212;
and they bowed and swooned in ecstasy when he did his daily
&quot;drive-by&quot;, riding very slowly past them in one of his
many Rolls Royces...

Rajneesh's teachings included, &quot;sex is fun, materialism is good
and Jesus was a madman,&quot; and the claim that he was &quot;the
world's greatest lover.&quot;
Materialism was so good that he had to spend millions of dollars just
to build a huge garage to house all of his Rolls Royces.
(By 1985, he had 93 of them.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
From his commune in rural eastern Oregon, his people
launched the only germ warfare attack on the USA since the Revolutionary
War (when the British deliberately infected Gen. George Washington's
troops with smallpox). The Rajneeshees infected the salad bars of
several restaurants in The Dalles, Oregon, with salmonella just before
election day, in an attempt to make everyone but their own people
too sick to vote, so that the Rajneeshees could take over the county
government. Rajneesh finally fled back to India to avoid prosecution
on a number of charges.

Bhagwan Rajneesh had a cute stunt: He claimed that his nose was so sensitive
that no one could come into his presence wearing perfume or scents of any kind,
lest his sensitive nose be offended. People who
wanted to hear one of his lectures, or have a darshan with him,
had to line up and submit to the &quot;sniff test&quot;,
where one of Bhagwan's lieutenants would sniff and examine the people
who hoped to come into the Bhagwan's presence. Even just having bathed
with a perfumed soap that day, or having used a perfumed shampoo, was cause for rejection.
Notice how that made people accustomed to submitting themselves to
humiliating treatment, while promoting the idea that the Bhagwan was extra-special.

<p>

It just goes on and on.
In cult after cult, the leader is just the greatest thing, and is so extra-special:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i><b>&quot;Ultimately you cannot admire the guru, you must worship him.&quot;</b></i>
</font>
(== Paul Brunton, <i>My Father's Guru</i>)

<p>
Likewise, in cults, the guru is worshipped more than the principles or doctrines that
the cult espouses.
Principles and doctrines fade into
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_flexible_morality">a vague, flexible, shifting morality</a>
that the guru can change on a whim.

<p>
<a name="antinomian"> </a>
Cult leaders often impose very strict rules on their followers, while breaking
those same rules themselves. Both the <i>EST</i> leader Werner Erhard and the
People's Temple leader Jim Jones felt entitled to control and prohibit the
sexual activities of their followers, while they enjoyed lives of
unlimited non-stop sexual indulgence themselves.
Jim Jones even considered <i>everybody</i> in the cult &#8212; women, men, and children
&#8212; to be fair game for his bedtime recreations, while he accused others
of being sinful and disgusting, even if they only had sex with their husbands and wives.

<p>
The cult leader is basically antinomian &#8212; meaning that he declares that
the rules do not apply to him.
Often, the excuse is that the guru has already &quot;made the grade&quot;, and doesn't
need to follow such rules any more. The rules are just for those spiritual students who have not
been &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;enlightened&quot; yet &#8212; which means everybody but the guru.

<p>
At least one phony guru who teaches yoga has actually stopped practicing yoga himself and is
turning into a fat slob. He declares that he doesn't need to do yoga any more &#8212; he &quot;has
arrived spiritually&quot; &#8212; he just teaches yoga to the youngsters.

Flexible, shifting morality</b></font><br>
<p>
The leader or his group defines and redefines the standards of morality.<br>
Previously illegal or immoral activities become okay because the leader or the group
says that they are okay.
<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
In <i>Synanon</i>, which was supposed to be a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program,
the leader Chuck Dederich relapsed and returned to drinking (he was a recovering alcoholic,
a former member of Alcoholics Anonymous).
So Dederich suddenly announced that alcohol was now okay for special ceremonial occasions.
It wasn't very long before every day was a special
occasion, and visitors noticed that a lot of the Synanon members seemed a bit tipsy, and
were even walking around Synanon with beer cans in their
hands.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>

<p><br>
Cult members may become criminals. Previously law-abiding people sometimes
become willing to commit serious crimes for the cult, all the while
rationalizing their actions by saying,
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li> &quot;It's okay because the Guru says that it's okay.&quot;
<li> &quot;We're doing it for God.&quot;
<li> &quot;We're doing it for the greater good.&quot;
<li> &quot;The end justifies the means.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are only doing it to them for their own good.&quot;
</ul>
</font>
<p>
Such rationalizations lead to abdication of personal responsibility for sins
or crimes &#8212; cult members say,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The group made me do it, or the Guru made me do it. So it isn't my fault.&quot;
</font>
<p>
In the Hari Krishnas, members were taught that cheating and short-changing
people to get more money for the cult was perfectly okay and quite moral,
because it's all God's money anyway, and they were just getting more of it for God.

<p>
In David Berg's <i>&quot;Children of God&quot;</i> cult, the women were
taught that working as a prostitute to get money for the cult was okay,
and even &quot;spiritual&quot;. Their husbands were instructed to work
as pimps, hawking their wives.
<p>
In Scientology, members learned that it was okay to break into U.S. Government offices
and steal files on people, to get information that could later be used to blackmail
opponents of Scientology. Several Scientology members, including the Founder's wife,
went to prison for years for that.

<p>
In addition, the cult often has a <i>Double Standard</i> &#8212; one set of rules for the Guru,
and another set of rules for everybody else. Likewise, a cult has one
set of rules for cult members, and another set of rules for outsiders.<br>


<p><br><font size="+2"><b>
<a name="cq_separatism"> </a>
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_separatism">63</a>.
Separatism</b></font><br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The cult has a separate reality, a separate language, and a separate
value system.
<li>
The cult has its own culture.
<li>
The cult occasionally has its own interpretation of history, or its
own interpretation of the Bible or some other religion's holy book.

<li>
Cult members learn to value other cult members more than outsiders.
<li>
Cult members tend to associate with each other more than
with any non-members.
<li>
Sometimes cult members physically separate themselves from
society and isolate themselves in their own compound, temple, or commune.
<li>
Cult members learn to value only the cult's teachings.
Outsiders' beliefs and moral standards are considered irrelevant.
<li>
As the cult develops its own separate idea of reality, it exhibits a
loss of common sense.
</ul>

<p>
A corollary to cults' claims of having
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way"><i>The Only Way</i></a>
is the belief that
&quot;the other people&quot; do not have <i>The Way</i>. &quot;They&quot; are
all misguided and missing the boat, and &quot;they&quot; won't be going to Heaven,
or they won't achieve Enlightenment, or they won't get
whatever the declared goal of the cult happens to be. Thus the cult encourages an
isolationist &quot;us versus them&quot; mindset, which is the heart of separatism.



<p><br><font size="+2"><b>
<a name="cq_no_criticism"> </a>
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_no_criticism">64</a>.
Inability to tolerate criticism</b></font><br>
<p>
Cults react strongly to even mild criticism. Cults have an overactive
&quot;circle the wagons&quot; <i>us-versus-them</i> defensive mentality.
When criticized, they often engage
in <i>ad hominem</i> attacks on the speaker, rather than challenging
the truthfulness of his statements, which are often correct.<br>
<p>
<a name="Scientology_counterattacks"> </a>
When it comes to fighting back viciously when criticized, few if any cults are worse
than Scientology.
Scientology is notorious for attacking, suing, and harassing anyone who criticizes Scientology.
Their official policy is to sue critics into bankruptcy by filing hundreds or
thousands of lawsuits against the critics, who will not even be able to pay for
the legal expenses of defending themselves. (The name of the anti-cult organization
&quot;Cult Awareness Network&quot; became the property of the Church of Scientology that way.)
But they go even further,
hiring private detectives to investigate and harass critics, practicing terrorist tactics against
critics and their families, and even framing people for crimes that they didn't commit.
<p>
<a name="disconnect"> </a>
John Atack, who wrote an excellent book on Scientology,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Blue_Sky"><i>A Piece Of Blue Sky</i></a>,
said of Scientology,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another tenet of Hubbard's &quot;scripture&quot; is that all opponents of Scientology
are criminals with undisclosed crimes. It should be a matter of some
amazement to scientologists given this prediction that I have managed
to criticise Scientology for twelve years without spending any time in
prison or being charged with any crime. In that time, however, scientologists
have been convicted in several countries.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The phobic attitude towards critics and the refusal of dialogue characterize
totalist groups or destructive cults. Scientologists are taught that anyone
who seeks to dissuade them from Scientology is &quot;suppressive&quot;.
If the
criticism cannot be silenced, then the scientologist should cease all
communication with the critic, or &quot;disconnect&quot;.
Any criticism of
Scientology is held to stem from undisclosed &quot;overts&quot; or moral transgressions.
The critic is asked &quot;what are your crimes?&quot;
This can be upsetting to the mystified parent of a raging scientologist.<br>

Scientologists framed the freelance writer
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Paulette_Cooper">Paulette Cooper</a>
for conspiring to bomb the Scientology headquarters because they didn't
like what she had written about Scientology in her book
<i>&quot;The Scandal of Scientology&quot;</i>.
<p>
In May, 1973, Paulette Cooper was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of making
bomb threats against the Church of Scientology, and of committing perjury
by denying the accusations. There were threatening letters on her stationery
and with her fingerprints on them.
<p>
But then in 1977 the FBI raided the
Scientology headquarters in several cities
because Scientologists had been stealing many thousands
of documents and records from several U.S. Government agencies (getting
information on other people). That is when the FBI
found proof that the Scientologists had faked the evidence against Ms. Cooper.
It turned out that agents for Scientology had stolen some sheets of her stationery
which she had touched, and then typed the threats against Scientology
on the fingerprinted paper.

<p>
It also turned out that her lover, a man with
whom she had shared her intimate personal secrets as well as her bed,
was actually a Scientology spy who had participated in the frame-up,
a spy who Xeroxed off her personal diaries while she was at work.
He had even reported to the Scientology headquarters that
she was depressed and contemplating suicide, and commented,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing for Scientology!&quot;</font>

<p>
Paulette Cooper said of Scientology spies:
<font color="blue">
&quot;Scientology sits on the stuff for years before revealing it.
Jerry was gone for about 5 years before pages of my teenage diary he
had photocopied started being sent anonymously to others.&quot;

The cult constantly demands that members abandon <i>self</i>,

The cult declares that self and ego are very bad, and must be eliminated.
The cult demands that members sacrifice themselves for the greater good.

Don't Trust Your Own Mind.</b></font><br>

Members are taught that they cannot trust their own minds,
that their thinking is somehow flawed. Almost invariably,
a cult's answer to that problem that the cult members must
let the cult leader or cult elders do their thinking for them.
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> Members are told that they have not prayed or chanted or meditated
enough, or done enough yoga, or gotten enough &quot;therapy&quot; to
straighten out their thinking.
<p><li>
Dissenting members are advised to seek a consensus in all matters.
One fundamentalist Christian cult taught,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;In the abundance of counselors there is safety. He who
trusts his own mind is a fool.&quot;
</i></font>

<p><li>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
Likewise, the <i>Love Family</i> cult told members who tried to
think critically,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;What's inside your mind is lies. We are your
mind. The group is your
mind.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>


<p><li> The Moonies tell their members that Satan has corrupted their minds,
so they cannot trust their thinking, and they especially cannot trust
any thoughts that are critical of Rev. Sun Myung Moon or his Unification
Church.

<a name="Scientology_mistrust_mind"> </a>
<p><li> Scientology teaches its members that their minds are crippled by
memories of past injuries, and that they must purchase hundreds of
thousands of dollars of Scientology &quot;auditing&quot; therapy in
order to recover.

<p><li> The Oxford Group taught that people had been defeated by sin, and
that their thinking was corrupted by sin. The cult leader
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a>
demanded that people surrender their minds and their lives to his cult
and let him do their thinking for them.

<p><li> Recovery cults declare that people's minds have been corrupted by
drugs or alcohol, and that they too must surrender control of their
thinking to someone else and let someone else run their lives, because
their thinking is &quot;alcoholic&quot; or &quot;addictive&quot;.

Just as members are told that they cannot trust their own thinking,
members are taught that they cannot trust their own feelings.
<p>
<ul>
<li> They are told that they are just being selfish and self-pitying if they feel
that they are being exploited or treated unfairly.
<li> They are told that their feelings are wrong or evil if they feel that there is something
about the cult that isn't quite right, and any resistance to cult indoctrination
is opposition to &quot;The Good&quot;. They are told that any doubts or suspicions about the cult
are weaknesses and wrong thoughts. That is often framed as &quot;The Devil is trying to turn you away
from the Light.&quot; Or, &quot;Your selfish desires die hard. They won't let go of you easily.&quot;
Frank Buchman's cult used the slogan, &quot;Don't forget that a hooked fish jumps, kicks, and runs.&quot;

<li> They are told that their desires for a normal
life outside of the cult are immoral and selfish (sometimes, desires put there by Satan).
<li> And they are told that they are selfish for wanting to make a decent living and have a
normal, comfortable home and good food.
<li> Many cults tell their members that they should only feel <i>Eternal Bliss</i> or some such
thing.
<li> And of course many cults tell their members that their sexual desires are evil and impure.
<li> They are even told that desiring to have a normal marital relationship with a spouse is selfish and wrong,
and is a diversion from &quot;The True Work&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
It isn't just religious cults that teach people not to feel their feelings. The Nazis did the same thing.
The Nazi teachings declared that a superior member of the <i>&Uuml;bermenschen</i> does not show pain,
and feels no sentimentality while killing <i>Untermenschen</i>, and takes joy only in those things
which advance the Nazi cause. They produced hard, cold, unfeeling monsters who could kill a thousand
people without flinching from the task. Heinrich Himmler bragged to his S.S. officers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Most of you know what it means to see a hundred corpses lying
together, five hundred, or a thousand. To have gone through this and
yet &#8212; apart from a few exceptions, examples of human weakness &#8212;
to have remained decent fellows, this is what has made us hard.<br>

The group takes over the individual's decision-making process.</b></font><br>
<p>
The group takes over the individual's decision-making process,
and plans and runs his whole life for him. The cult reduces the
individual to dependence upon the cult for all important decisions, and even
for minor ones. It is common for members of cults to even have to ask permission
to go visit their own family, or to go to a parent's funeral.
<p>
Many cults reduce their members to such helplessness that they are
incapable of making the simplest of decisions without asking their mentor
or leader for guidance. In one of his anti-cult books, Steve Hassan
advised parents to watch out for hesitation on the part of their children
when they ask the children to come home for a visit. An answer like<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I'm not sure, let me see, let me think about it for a while,&quot;</i></font><br>
really means<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Give me time to ask my mentor for permission to visit my old family.&quot;</i></font>


<p><br><font size="+2"><b>
<a name="cq_you_owe"> </a>
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_you_owe">70</a>.
You Owe The Group.</b></font><br>
<i>You owe everything to the group. The group says that it made you what
you are, and gave you everything that you have, so now you are obligated to
the group.</i>
<p>
<a name="Scientology_you_owe"> </a>
The third item in the Scientology &quot;Code of Honor&quot; is:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
3. Never desert a group to which you owe your support.
</font>
</blockquote>
&#8212; Meaning: after Scientology has taken all of your money, and all of your free labor, you
still owe L. Ron Hubbard your life.
And to that end, members of the <i>Sea Org</i> &#8212; the sea-going branch of the organization &#8212;
would sign <i>Billion-Year Contracts</i>, swearing to serve L. Ron Hubbard in all future
reincarnations for the next billion years.
<p>
Similarly, many other cults will claim that their practices like chanting or meditation gave
you sanity and enlightenment, so you owe the group for that. Pseudo-Christian groups will
claim that they saved you from Satan, so you owe them.
<p>

In Synanon, even though William Olin was a healthy non-addict
and a successful architect who had joined
Synanon because he had believed in it as a utopian social movement,
and even though Olin had given
Synanon his life savings and had worked for Synanon for free for
ten years, when Olin discussed the problems with Synanon and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Olins_exit">announced that he was leaving</a>,
the cult claimed that Synanon had given him everything,
and that he was
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;just a sour, ungrateful asshole.&quot;</font>
