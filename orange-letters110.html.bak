<p>
Dude, I must say I'm impressed with our effort but I keep asking
myself &quot;why&quot;?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anthony,
<p>
Here is the standard answer to the question &quot;why?&quot;:

<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">Bait-and-switch treatment</a>

</font>
<p>
You are free to attend AA meetings or not, just like everyone else is.
If it's not your thing, then by all means don't go. But why all this
work to pick it apart ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, people are not free to attend or not. A whole lot of people are
coerced into the 12-Step racket.
More than half of all of the current A.A. members were pressured,
coerced, and shoved into A.A. by one means or another.
Look here:
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">Aggressive Recruiting</a>.
</font>
<p>
Alcoholism is a terrible disease and many lives are ripped apart or lost
to it. This isn't AA's fault. AA is passing on the solution used by Bill W,
Dr. Bob and the &quot;first 100&quot; as outlined in the Big Book.<br>
That's all.<br>
There isn't any more to it.<br>
Really.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, alcoholism is terrible, but that doesn't make A.A. good.

<p>
A.A. is not a solution &#8212; it is an old cult religion
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">that doesn't help with alcoholism</a>. That's all.
<p>
Oh, and 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#hundred">
the &quot;first 100&quot; were really only 40</a>. Bill Wilson was playing fast and loose with
the numbers, as usual.

</font>
<p>
This is from page 95 of The Big Book (bold print added by me) :

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot; If he thinks he can do the job in some other way, or prefers some
other spiritual approach, encourage him to follow his own conscience. We
have no monopoly on God; <b>we merely have an approach that worked with
us</b>. But point out that we alcoholics have much in common and that you
would like, in any case to be friendly. Let it go at that.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It honestly is as benign as that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What you are exposing is
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">
the bait-and-switch nature of Alcoholics Anonymous propaganda</a>.
Bill Wilson opened discussions with mild-sounding statements like &quot;we know only a little&quot;, and &quot;we have no monopoly&quot;,
but then he switched to death threats and declared that A.A. really was the only way:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested
<font color="#9F0000">[MY required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to <font color="#9F0000">[MY]</font> spiritual principles.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual
experience will conquer. &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
At first some of us tried to avoid the
issue, hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after
a while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual
basis of life &#8212; or else.</font><br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 44.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the A.A. slogans are:
<ul>
<li> &quot;Works the Steps or Die!&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;If you leave A.A., your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;It's Our Way or the Die Way.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;It is <i>suggested</i> that you <i>Work The Steps</i>, just like how, if you jump out of an airplane with a parachute, it is 'suggested' that you pull the ripcord to save your life.<br>
<li> &quot;Do The Steps or Die.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Share Or Die.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Talk Or Die.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Change Or Die.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;A.A.'s like the Mafia &#8212; If you leave it, you die.&quot;<br>
</ul>

<p>
It is honestly as malicious as that.
<p>
Oh, and the line that you bold-faced is untrue:
<font color="black">&quot;we merely have an approach that worked with us...&quot;</font>
<br>
No, it didn't work for them. Bill Wilson was just exaggerating and lying again.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">The early A.A. had a horrible failure rate</a>.
Early A.A. didn't work any better than playing tiddly-winks for sobriety.
</font>
<p>
I just hope that you don't help enable people who otherwise might have
been able to recover.<br>
You may be guilty of the very same things you accuse AA of. You accuse
AA of killing people, but I hope you haven't.<br>
An active Alcoholic looking for an excuse not to recover (thinking
exactly the way I used to think) will be only too eager to believe you
when you tell them AA is a cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And there it is:
<a name="orange-letters73.html#disservice">the standard attack</a>
from the A.A. members who drank the koolaid:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are killing alcoholics by telling the truth and steering them away from Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;
</font>
<br>
But that can't be true, because A.A. does not work to save the lives of alcoholics.
</font>
<p>
Well, I'm sure I can't tell you anything you haven't already heard. I
hope you enjoy a long sober life. But I do hope you don't harm anyone
else with you theories.

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
AA relies heavily upon mandates and SAT centers for attendees.  Without them, AA
would be very small.
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
[SAT = Substance Abuse Treatment]
</font>
<p>
Three Federal Courts of Appeal have ruled against coerced attendance.  These rulings
have to be enforced.  And, people have to take action to see that the rulings are
obeyed.

<p>
12 step is, in my view, malpractice.  SAT centers using 12 step are using an
iatrogenic method.  Such centers have to be sued and malpractice judgments made
against them.  That will chill their ardor for 12 step and AA/NA.
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
[iatrogenic = causes a disease, rather than cures one]
</font>

<p>
Education that AA/NA does not work; and, that better methods exist, are becoming
better known.

<p>
AA is, really, quite small.  The one million number put out is an estimate of those
who attend.  The actual membership is small.

<p>
I really appreciate your work.  You have increased public awareness of the
iatrogenic nature of AA/NA/12 step

Subject:  	AA's &quot;success&quot; rate<br>

<p>
Hey,
<p>
It's me, John L. I have been investigating this thing for many years, before I
was a Christian and after I was saved. I want to thank you for standing up to
something you realized was not what it was purported to be.
<p>
Agent Orange, what is the latest on AA's success rate? I know a few years ago their
own survey showed only one in twenty was still attending one year after initial
visit. And Bill, in one of Kurtz's footnotes, refers to &quot;thousands&quot; who could not be
helped by AA.
<p>
Anyway, you are probably right on top of success rates etc. Thanks. I ask my God to
bless you.
<p>
John

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
The net success rate is still zero.  That is, A.A. has an apparent success rate of about five percent,
but the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholism is also about five percent per year.
A.A. cannot claim the credit for the people who were going to quit anyway.
When you subtract the rate of
spontaneous remission from the A.A. success rate, you get zero.
<p>
The latest news on this issue comes from New Mexico.
Very recently, the team of
<a href="orange-letters101.html#Miller">William R. Miller</a>
at the Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology, University of New Mexico,
published a paper where they describe a study which found <b>no effect</b> for spiritual intervention in a large
randomized clinical trial:
<p>
<i>Spiritual direction in addiction treatment: Two clinical trials</i><br>
W. Miller, A. Forcehimes, M. O'Leary, M. LaNoue,<br>
<b>Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment</b>, Volume 35, Issue 4, Pages 434-442.<br>

<p>
That's big. True, valid, randomized clinical trials of A.A. or 12-Step treatment are as rare as hen's teeth.
And every time one has been done, the researchers have again found A.A. to be a failure &#8212; completely ineffective,
or worse. (&quot;Worse than completely ineffective&quot; means that A.A. causes more alcoholics to die.)

<p>
By the way, I don't mean to imply that all spiritual things are invalid. I think the researchers were using
the Alcoholics Anonymous definition of &quot;spirituality&quot;,
or &quot;spiritual treatment of alcoholism&quot;, which I would call
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html">crazy heresy</a>&quot;.
<p>
Have a good day.

Dear Sir,

<p>
Thank you so much for your work at your site. I am so grateful for you
presence on the internet. I am in my own battle right now with the
system do to a DUI. I am guilty of a DUI, there is no doubt. I am on
probation because of my mistake. But what happened after my alcohol
evaluation and treatment was just shocking. How can this be? I am
baffled how they wish me to admit that drinking and mistakes are not
my fault (disease), and to give my life and will to the program (by
admitting my mistakes). You know the drill.

<p>
I will be putting together a new website, to join the ranks, as I am
web-developer on a mission. It will be part of my therapy and recovery
process. I have been sober for 6 plus month, IN SPITE of my treatment.

<p>
Anyway, thanks for being there, with the information and the humor. It
was much needed.

<p>

again from me. I hope everyone that stands up will help reform the
current situation. Thanks!

Hello Chris,

In the beginning, anonymity was necessary because my housing was owned

That corporation is called &quot;Central City Concern&quot;, and they are still running that
&quot;treatment center&quot;, which is named &quot;PAAC&quot;, Portland Alternative Addictions Center.
They also run another &quot;PAAC&quot;, the Portland Alternative Acupuncture Center, where they poke needles
into alcoholics and addicts, and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#acupuncture_hoax">claim that it reduces their cravings</a>.

But times have changed. Anonymity isn't necessary any more. I don't live there any more, so they can't

Hi Orange

Congratulations on a fantastic site. You certainly have an amazing talent
for spotting bullshit. I've found it all fascinating, incisive, very well-written
and laugh-out-loud funny. You've convinced me to dump AA and try SMART. Knowing
about Lizard Brain would have been a big help. I know you hate nit-pickers, but as
your site is so well done, I think it deserves to have the few typing errors
corrected, so I've listed the ones I spotted, from after I read
orange-effectiveness, onwards. Hope you don't take offense.

Hi Alan,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I hope you are doing well.
<p>

Thanks for the list of errors. You must have incredibly sharp eyes. I've been looking at those things for
years and didn't catch them. That was quite a long list.
<p>
I like it when people catch those typos.
I don't consider that nit-picking,
not when it is done to actually correct errors and improve the site.
That makes it a lot easier for me to fix things, and I like to fix things.
<p>
The thing about <a href="orange-propaganda.html#nitpick">nit-pickers</a>
is that they find some minor misspelling or typographical error, and then
declare that the whole web site is invalid because of it.

<p>
I don't know about the Virgin blocking. I have also heard that if people download the Comcast toolbar, in
parts of the USA,
that it will block my web site as a &quot;phishing web site&quot; that steals people's identities.
<p>
That is totally untrue, of course. I don't even have any cgi-bin or fill-in forms that <i>could</i> steal
people's personal information.
<p>
My web site is no more dangerous than a book printed on paper. It can't steal information from people.
<p>
Would people who use Virgin or Comcast please tell me whether they are seeing any blocking of the Orange Papers web site?

Thanks, and have a good day.

It's sad that you have nothing better to do than tear apart a worthy
organization such as AA.  Regardless of the numbers you spew, there is but
one bottom line.  If someone works the program, and I do mean TRULY works
the program, the program will work for them 100% of the time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rita,
<p>
What you are saying is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If someone quits drinking, and I do mean TRULY quits drinking, then it
will look like A.A. works and does something good.&quot;
</font>
<p>
What works? I mean, what is the essential core thing that someone absolutely
must do in order to &quot;work the program&quot;?

<p>
<ol>
<li> It can't be going to A.A. meetings.  That is optional.
You can go to as few or as many as you like.
In the early days of A.A., Bill Wilson bragged about
the &quot;lone wolf&quot; members of A.A. who just ordered the book and read it, and got sober, and never went
to a meeting.
<p>
<li>  It can't be working the 12 Steps, because they are only suggestions. You don't have to work the Steps.
<p>
<li> It can't be reading the <i>Big Book</i>. I've had people email me and say
that my criticism of what is in the <i>Big Book</i> is irrelevant, because they
have many years of sobriety and they have never read the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
<li> It can't be &quot;Coming to Believe&quot; in &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
That is also optional. Bill Wilson said that you didn't have to believe anything.
And A.A. defenders routinely brag to me about the atheist chapters of A.A.
<p>
<li> It can't be getting a sponsor. Lots of sober people never had a sponsor.
<p>
<li> It can't be recruiting. Some A.A. members brag to me that they have never gone recruiting.
</ol>
<p>
So what is &quot;The Program&quot;?
<p>
Apparently, the only real program is that you are commanded to quit drinking by using your own
determination and will power, and then you must give the credit for the quitting to Alcoholics
Anonymous.

<p>
Oh, and that doesn't work to make alcoholics quit drinking.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
This is the most misinterpreted misrepresented paper I have ever read...
Talk about someone trying to brainwash..

<p>
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">
The First Fascist Mad Scientist of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>

<p>
But in reading it, it sounds like it was written by an intellectual
narcissist who struggles with his/her sobriety and perhaps gender identity
(just a hunch)...  We are all brainwashed from day 1.  Its called
socialization.... What isn't a cult? The books and papers you choose to
read, the music to which you listen, even your gender identity or perhaps
gender identity disordered rainbow that drove you to drink are al aspects of
socialization  &#8212; &quot;brainwashing&quot; Its all brainwashing... Whats not a cult?
If you don't conform &#8212; there are consequences. Some in AA claim that they
needed to have their brains washed of self-righteous indignation, type-A
behavior, narcissism, and selfishness..  Sounds like good living to me.
Sounds like the authour is a bit bitter because s/he may have tried AA and
couldn't not drink &#8212; just for one day.. Perhaps tried &quot;responsible&quot; drinking
and couldn't  have just one... just for one day..  Simply put &#8212; you didn't
fit in otherwise why write such hideous bitter prose?What a bitter
diatribe,...

<p>
As an addiction researcher and academician and a member of the &quot;AA cult&quot;, AA
works as well as any other approach &#8212; the data from noted addiction
researchers from NIAAA and NIDA have published papers on the issue. And it
works because it functionally uses cognitive-behavioral therapy and social
support.- although AA doesn't care how it works because those of us who are
really sick need to keep it simple and stupid to survive.   Brainwashing?
Perhaps &#8212; but sobriety..  .

<p>
I'd like to see some citations of your sources..  And as an aside, ego is
used many senses. Its a construct that can't really be measured empirically.

<p>
So &#8212; go back to your intellectual masturbation and keep chasing that
apocraphal dragon...

<p>
Joe from AA

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Joe,
<p>
Starting with your request for citations: Those documents <i>are</i> the citations.
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Tiebout_papers">Those are the original Tiebout documents</a>.

<p>
Well, most social organizations are not cults. The mainstream churches, the schools, universities, government &#8212; 
they are not cults.
<p>
Do you even know what a cult is? Please read
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>.

<p>
You claim that
<font color="black">
&quot;AA works as well as any other approach.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Oh really? And how well is that? What is the actual A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
<p>
You claimed,
<font color="black">
&quot;...the data from noted addiction
researchers from NIAAA and NIDA have published papers on the issue.&quot;
</font>

 &#8212; which is kind of garbled, but I understand your drift. Well, you still have not given any actual
information about the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Precisely who wrote what, and where and when did they publish it? What did they really say?
And how many of them actually did any real controlled testing of A.A.-based treatment?  Real testing, like
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>?
Just because somebody writes some paper that praises A.A. does not mean
that it is evidence that A.A. really works to make alcoholics quit drinking.

<p>
Here are some real controlled studies, valid clinical trials:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour</a> was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.

<p>
<li> And the most damning evidence of all came from a current leader of Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who is a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous [World]
Services, Inc.. He found that Alcoholics Anonymous was completely ineffective for getting alcoholics
to quit drinking, and the biggest effect of A.A. was to raise the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.

Subject:  	You rock!!<br>

<p>
Hi Agent Orange, thank you so much for all the fantastic research you have
made available online.  More power to you.  I hope that the cult members
haven't retaliated too much.

<p>
I've also been reading about
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the Midtown group</a>.
The 12 steps are a perfect
template for creating a cult.  Taken from a cult leader and improved upon by
a cult leader and handed on down to any psychopath who wants to feather his
own nest and bang all the hot newcomers.  I really don't see any difference
between Bill W and Mike Q.

<p>
I'm angry that I was directed into NA at the age of 18.  The NA that I was
in 20 years ago was no different from the Midtown group.  Addict business
owners had a constant pool of cheap labor for their businesses (while
telling everybody to take welfare so they wouldn't have to pay them full
wages).  Charismatic half way house managers dealt pounds of cocaine.  The
most powerful older sober members ensured their wealth by indebting
impoverished women from Thailand to work in brothels for them (aka sexual
slavery).  The hierarchy was pretty much a mafia.

<p>
Like Scientology they do name drop their famous addicts.  The identities of
the celebrity members were made well known.  They in turn would spout their
brainwashing to the media.  I will never forget the impact one of those
interviews had on me.  It certainly encouraged me to play down my
skepticism.

<p>
Interestingly enough that first local celebrity who attracted me with his
nationally published interviews constantly relapsed and ended up dying alone
in a hotel room with a bottle of methadone.  Perhaps if his head hadn't been
filled with &quot;disease concept&quot; and he hadn't fallen into the clutches of an
egotistical, wagon-hitching sponsor he'd still be alive and creating
beautiful art today?

<p>
In spite of how much I pretended that I belonged I never really believed
what they told me.  As an atheist who couldn't believe in a Christian god
provided by myriad established churches, how on earth could I believe in a
God that I simply made up?  Like my own &quot;make believe&quot; was somehow superior
to the Pope's &quot;make believe&quot;?

<p>
So I was told to &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;.  If everybody is faking it
until they make it, all you are left with is a room full of fakes.

<p>
<a name="social"> </a>
After the &quot;love bombing&quot; phase had worn off, my skepticism returned and I
couldn't sit through a meeting without believing that everybody was lying.
The steps NEVER made sense to me.  I did a 4th step 3 times in hope that
&quot;something&quot; would happen.  Naturally at the end of 3 years, when I drank wine
at a party, my world crumbled.  My social system collapsed, my status within
the group was gone, &quot;friends&quot; withdrew their friendship.  Luckily by this
stage I had embarked on a university degree and had some healthy structure
in my life.

<p>
The thing that really annoyed me about the braggarts and liars in the rooms
was they did nothing with their lives.  There were people there whose sole
achievement in life was that they'd been doing the same thing (ie nothing)
every day in a row for 5 years.   Well not doing nothing, actually it was
worse than nothing because they were spinning counter productive lies to
vulnerable people.

<p>
It hurts me now to think of all those beautiful young people who entered the
rooms, believed what they were told about &quot;relapse&quot; and &quot;a chronic disease&quot;
and went out on all or nothing binges.  I think it's the worst thing in the
world to tell a teenager that they will get worse and worse and worse when
in all likelihood what they are doing is a typical part of growing up and is
rapidly left behind them once they choose a direction in life.  So sad.  No
doubt the 12 steps have killed more people than they have helped.

<p>
<a name="Narateen"> </a>
At this time in my city, there was also Naranon and a small Narateen
movement.  That core group of '80s era Narateen children all went on to
become junkies.  Their poor misguided parents, trustingly put them in
&quot;recovery&quot; as children and it only served to internalize worthless and
damaging beliefs about substance use.

<p>
If there was a hell, Bill W should burn it it.

<p>
all the best

Thanks for the info... FYI, all drunks are screwed up, that's why they are

That's why AA works... a bunch of screwed up, crazy drunks come together and they

a God- send literally... Your head would spin if I told you about the coincidences
in my life since crawling into an AA meeting.

Hello Scott,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You are making a bunch of groundless assumptions, like that A.A. works.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">A.A. does not work</a>.
You should be able to see that with your own eyes if you have been around A.A. for very long.
The A.A. clubhouse has a revolving door on the front of it.
They come, they go, they come, they go.
<p>
What is the actual A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.

<p>
Then you assume that happy coincidences mean something, like that they are signs from Above, or
some Higher Power is rigging the game for your benefit.
Sorry to pop your balloon, but that is a false assumption.
Most coincidences are just coincidences. Do you believe that when things are not
going well for you, when one thing after another goes wrong,
that it is because Higher Power has it in for you, and is rigging the game against you?
Why not? That is also a coincidence, and it's just as real as when the good things happen.

<p>
I half-agree with this statement:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Believe me, it takes a lot of time to reverse a lifetime of chronically bad thinking
and emotional problems... abstinence from alcohol/drugs is only the beginning... &quot;
</font>
<p>
It does take time to fix things, and heal, yes.
But participation in a cult religion will not help you there &#8212; it will make you worse off. And I can
see the effects of cultish indoctrination in how you denigrate yourself:
<font color="black">
<i>&quot;a lifetime of chronically bad thinking.&quot;</i></font> A whole
lifetime of bad thinking? Already?  And how old are you?
<p>
I believe that if you examine your life carefully, you will find that the vast majority of your thinking
was okay. You just made a few disastrously bad decisions, like deciding to drink too much alcohol, and you
believed some unrealistic wrong things, like that you could get happy from drinking alcohol, and that
drinking more alcohol would make you even happier.  Those erroneous thoughts caused you much suffering.
But you don't have to make sweeping statements about how you are guilty of &quot;a lifetime of chronically bad thinking&quot;.
But that is what A.A. teaches you to do.
That is how A.A. will make you mentally ill in a different way.

<p>
You say that your father never had a chance. You know, I feel the same way about mine, because of
his upbringing, his life in the military, his belief structure, and his mindset.
After two previous failures at trying to quit drinking and stay sober
with the V.A. and a Christian Brotherhood, he went to A.A., did seven
years there, and then went out and was never heard from again.  I, on the other hand,
became a hippy and took LSD and lived on a commune.
Apparently, that gave me a much better chance, because now I have 8 years clean and sober
 &#8212; totally clean, not even smoking cigarettes or pot
or anything anymore, and I feel fine.
<p>
In truth, I think everybody has a chance, or several chances. Some people just don't use them right.
<p>
Have a good day.

I always enjoy reading the latest from you and especially the mail section.
It's an endless source of information and, quite frankly a great deal of

<p>
Along those lines,  Fark.com is my homepage.... it's a
collection of funny/interesting/topical articles from various sources that
submitters post with funny and inventive, often offensive headlines.  Each
article has a dedicated thread where all comments and opinions are fair
game.  It gets rough in there most times, especially with hot-button issues,
as we all know AA is.  Today someone linked to an article that asked &quot;Is AA

Then a funny thing happened.  Dammit.  The daily meetings I attend began to
become &#8212; how can I put it &#8212; grating on my sensibilities.  There are many
reasons.

<p>
What I can say is that I have 40 months of sobriety and that AA helped me
get sober.  I don't think it is going to help me STAY sober however.  That's
my decision now.

<p>
So, in a funny way, thanks for writing the papers.  I guess you've endured
unbelievable criticism.

Hi Kevin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
It sounds like you are ready to move on to the next phase. (Or probably, already have, considering how
slow I am to answer some email.) If A.A. helped you somehow in the beginning, then good. But if it
is grating on your nerves now, then that means that you are seeing both sides of the coin, and it
probably is time to move upwards and onwards.
<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

<p>
hello.
i tried twice to edit the article on AA in wikipedia.  i wrote a short
blurb on criticism.. i wrote about the Harvard study, and included an
external link to the orange papers.  both times they erased it.
<p>
wtf?

Hi William,
<p>
That's why I don't bother with Wikipedia. The Wiki is fine if you are
writing about a non-controversial subject like Canon camera lenses.
Then you can go on for many pages, laying out all of the information,
and no one will erase it.
<p>
Alas, there is a crowd of A.A. true believers who constantly hover
over the A.A. pages like vultures, and watch the Wikipedia for any
information that they don't like, and when they see something, they
immediately edit the page and erase the information.
<p>
It's just a problem with the Wikipedia idea where anybody can edit
a page. It doesn't work for controversial subjects. You end up with
opposing groups battling each other, and constantly erasing their
opponents' work.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I am glad that you are less disturbed by this than i am.  AA is a
dangerous cult, which, i believe has caused more deaths than
drinking.    i have witnessed, and my former sponsor (he defected too)
have witnessed people who have killed themselves while in the program.
in each case it was from being berated, being told things like &quot;you have
no control of your life&quot; &quot;your best thinking got you here&quot; &quot;you are not
normal&quot; &quot;you are diseased&quot; &quot; you cannot have a relationship&quot;  etc.
I would really like to help get the word out that it does  not work, and
that it is  a haven for control freaks only.


<p>

Hi again, William,

<p>
You certainly can help to get the word out. Please do. You can write
to all kinds of forums and media outlets, and don't forget your
Congressman and Senators. It's just the Wikipedia that is unusable
for controversial subjects.

<p>
And have a good day.

From the start, I detected that you were a shameless psychological, social,
spiritual, financial and emotional mooch.
You simply love to hear yourself talk.

It obvious that your ignorance is greater than your ego. I will pray for
anyone who seeks your counsel for this fatal disease. You are truly an
evil man who will one day have to stand before God and account for this
evil deed.
