From: TS <br>
Subject: different perspective<br>


<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
I came across your website the other day and spent quite a
bit of time reading. After several hours, although I
probably read less than one percent of your vast writings, I
felt like I had the gist of your message, which is an
important one. That is, that 12 step programs are inherently
fraught with danger, and often enough, do more harm than
good. Your passion comes through loud and clear and it is
clear you write out of a desire to help people. It is
terrible that people can go to a 12 step program in their
most vulnerable time and be taken advantage of. I can
relate, because a similar thing has happened to me, though
not in a 12 step program.

<p>
I'm writing because I have had a different experience. I
have never been to AA, but I have committed to a program in
Adult Children of Alcoholics. Over the time I have spent in
the program, I have improved my ability to trust people and
achieve greater intimacy with my wife and children. In fact,
it is not an overstatement to say that it has saved my
marriage. Over time, I have learned that I can say my truth
in a room full of people who will listen and not judge. I
have learned that others are entitled to their feelings,
just as I am entitled to mine, and that I do not have to
manipulate others to get what I need. I am slowly letting go
of my fear of being myself, openly, for all the world to
see.

<p>
The way I reconcile your story with mine &#8212; I see both as
valid &#8212; is that 12 step programs are hugely dependent on the
particular personalities, and on the literature. I'm lucky
enough to be in a group with wonderful people. I've never
experienced or witnessed people in my group belittling,
undermining, seducing, or otherwise taking advantage of
others in the group. Questions are welcome, and I've often
heard people question the literature in the midst of a
share, and this is totally acceptable. I cannot relate to
your comparisons to a cult, speaking only for the group I
participate in.

<p>
Obviously those things can and do occur in other meetings,
and unfortunately it looks like that was your experience
(and those of many who write into your site). For all those
people who write in (and those who don't) it is a good thing
that your site exists, so they can get some relief and
validation that their experience is what their instincts say
it is.

<p>
Speaking of the literature, I also think the focus of ACOA
is pretty different than AA. In AA, as I understand it, the
focus is on drinking, the daily struggle to not drink, and
so on. In ACOA, the focus is on the survival mechanisms we
developed as children to get through the abuse and neglect,
seeing how those mechanisms helped us as kids, hurt us as
adults, and finally how to let go of those mechanisms and
find the courage and strength to accept love and intimacy in
our lives.

<p>
<a name="powerless1"> </a>
You write quite extensively about the steps and how harmful
the implied message of the steps are. That they encourage
people to accept powerlessness and expect people to turn
their recovery over to God. Given your personal experience,
I understand why you take the perspective you do, and why
you see these as cult-like exhortations to give yourself up
to the group-mind.

<p>
However, a more charitable view of the steps is possible.
For instance, the ACOA literature makes a distinction
between powerlessness and helplessness. You can be powerless
over your reaction to an angry person, for instance, but you
can learn how to deal with that inevitable reaction. As
another example, &quot;let go and let god&quot; is actually a way of
moving people out of old, dsyfunctional patterns of
control-oriented behavior and into an open-ended mindset in
which uncertainty is tolerated. Inventorying your past is
not about making people feel bad, but about claiming
responsibility, achieving forgiveness, and moving on.

<p>
My purpose here is not to argue with you or to refute your
writings or anything like that. It is simply to balance one
perspective with another.

<p>
Many of the people in my ACOA group have experience with
AA, and quite a few of them openly vent about the atmosphere
of intolerance, so your website was not my first exposure to
complaints about AA. It was however the first time I heard
about serious abuses or the idea that going to AA is worse
than going it alone. Reading about it did make me question
my own group. This letter is the fruit of my questioning.

<p>
I offer my own experience to demonstrate that &quot;your mileage
may vary&quot;. Not all groups are parasitic. I think ACOA in
particular offers a nurturing atmosphere in which folks can
come and learn a healthier way to live.

<p>
All the best,<br>
Terren S.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Terren,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
It is nice that you have a bunch of nice people in your ACOA group, and
you have found a comfortable niche in ACOA meetings.
That does not prove that the 12 Steps are good therapy for abused children.
<p>

<a name="powerless2"> </a>
This is double-talk:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;You can be powerless
over your reaction to an angry person, for instance, but you
can learn how to deal with that inevitable reaction.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Obviously, if you can learn how to deal with the reaction,
then you are not powerless over it. And I would go a step further,
and say that you are not powerless over &quot;having reactions&quot;. You can choose to
react in one way, or react in a different way.
You have control over your emotions.
(By the way,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322003637/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>
teaches some techniques for that.)


<p>
Then you said,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;The way I reconcile your story with mine &#8212; I see both as
valid &#8212; is that 12 step programs are hugely dependent on the
particular personalities, and on the literature.&quot;<br>
</font>
But what that proves is that some people will heal themselves, and get better, and some won't.
The 12 Steps have nothing to do with it.
<p>
The 12 Steps are totally inappropriate for a therapy program to help people get over
child abuse. It takes immense twisting of words, and redefinition of words, to
shoe-horn the 12 Steps into something that allegedly helps people who were abused
as children.
<p>
Then you said,
<font color="black">
&quot;I've often
heard people question the literature in the midst of a
share, and this is totally acceptable.&quot;<br>
</font>

Well obviously, the scare level is a little different. They can't claim that you
will make an alcoholic die drunk in the gutter if you question &quot;the Program&quot;.

<p>
Then you said,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Speaking of the literature, I also think the focus of ACOA
is pretty different than AA.&quot;<br>
</font>
Well the focus had better be different. The focus of A.A. is supposed to be to
quit drinking. Obviously, the focus of ACOA is something else. And the focus of ACOA
can't be to make you so &quot;spiritual&quot; that you stop getting abused by a drunkard.
You don't have to &quot;quit&quot; getting abused, and start collecting tokens for
&quot;years of sobriety&quot;.

<p>
<a name="powerless3"> </a>
Then you wrote:<br>
<font color="black">
As another example, &quot;let go and let god&quot; is actually a way of
moving people out of old, dsyfunctional patterns of
control-oriented behavior and into an open-ended mindset in
which uncertainty is tolerated.
</font>
<br>
Please show me where that was ever shown to work. What psychological experiment
or controlled study showed that to be a valid psychological technique?
I mean really. Where is the evidence that Buchmanism works to do anything good?
<p>
And who says that &quot;control-oriented behavior&quot; is bad? That is Frank Buchman's demand
that you &quot;surrender&quot; and be &quot;powerless&quot;, again. That is very bad psychotherapy.
It harms people. It makes them worse, not better. It even drives some to suicide.
<p>
The jabber about
<font color="black">
&quot;an open-ended mindset in which uncertainty is tolerated&quot;
</font>
 is just more psycho-babble and slogan-slinging.
Abused children already know all about lack of control and uncertainty in their lives.
<p>
<a name="blissing"> </a>
Have you ever heard the term &quot;blissing out&quot;?
It is easy to just bliss out and pretend that everything is wonderful.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, I am so happy that I can accept having no control over my life.
I am just like a leaf in the wind, no control over where God will send me next.&quot;<br>
</font>
But suppose it isn't God who is determining what happens to you next?<br>
What if you just surrendered your fate to a random roll of the dice?<br>
Or to the manipulations of a bad person?

<p>
This is more double-talk:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Inventorying your past is
not about making people feel bad, but about claiming
responsibility, achieving forgiveness, and moving on.&quot;
</font>
<br>
But ACOA is about abused children having been hurt by alcoholic parents.
That &quot;claiming responsibility&quot; talk is a bunch of bull.
Abused children are not responsible for what was done to them.
So you do not have to &quot;claim responsibility&quot;.
<p>
And &quot;achieving forgiveness&quot;?
And why does an abused child need to &quot;achieve forgiveness&quot;?
What is the child being forgiven for? How did the child do something wrong
by getting abused, and not liking it?
Who has the power to grant that forgiveness? A priest? An old-timer with lots of
years of going to ACOA meetings?
<p>
Lastly, your repeated assertions that we have &quot;different viewpoints&quot;, and
different &quot;personal experience&quot;, and different &quot;perspective&quot;, and
&quot;your mileage may vary&quot; is just use of the propaganda and debating
technique called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape Via
Relativism</a>. You write as if the only issue is our different opinions of things,
and &quot;different viewpoints&quot;.
You seem to think that ACOA and 12-Step cult religion is just fine therapy for abused children
because you enjoy your meetings, and you have a different viewpoint than me. Not so.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;E.A.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
Thank you, thank you, thank you for putting this website up<br>
(<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-spirrel.html</a>)!

<p>
I am editing a book that mentions AA, and I wanted to state the fact that
women were banned at first (I had read it in the &quot;Big Book&quot; years ago when I
was supporting the alcoholic with whom I was in a relationship). It took me
about half an hour to find that fact online... on your website. I wanted to
be extra sure before I put it in the book I'm editing. I saw so many
websites that didn't mention anything about this dirty little secret, until
I came upon yours.

<p>
I was in a relationship with an alcoholic years ago and was flabbergasted by
the hypocrisy of the organization.

<p>
<a name="powerless4"> </a>
The idea of powerlessness has now been disputed by many psychiatrists as
dangerous and self-defeating. Any time people correct what is wrong in their
lives, it is because they have summoned their inner strength. Didn't their
own inner strength lead them to AA to begin with? And now AA wants to take
it away.

<p>
&quot;God&quot; as we understand &quot;HIM?&quot; I guess that leaves out people who understand
it as an entity, or a woman, or inner strength, or pure spirit. It is so
assumed that &quot;god&quot; is a man that they don't even realize the hypocrisy in
what they are saying.

<p>
They always begin their meetings by saying they were not affiliated with any
religion, yet they often start out by having everyone recite the &quot;Our
Father,&quot; a patriarchal, Christian prayer. And no one in the meeting thinks
this is odd.

<p>
Many people become sober without AA.

<p>
The person with whom I was in the relationship years ago encouraged me to go
to Al-Anon. I went for about three months. The book of daily readings had
quotes such as &quot;Forget your anger&quot; and &quot;You made a vow!&quot; to encourage any
abused wives beaten regularly by their alcoholic husbands... wives who also
watch their husbands beat and abuse their children... to stay married to
them.

<p>
Thank you again for your website.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi EA,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.
I have to agree with all of your points. But let me amplify a couple of them:
<p>
<a name="powerless5"> </a>
About powerlessness. Yes, indeed. I think that is one of the worst aspects of
A.A. and Buchmanism. Teaching powerlessness is so crippling.
I know it hurts people, and probably kills a bunch of them.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">When Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma tested A.A.</a>,
he found that the group of alcoholics
who got A.A. as treatment were doing five times as much binge drinking as
a similar group of alcoholics who got no treatment at all.
I do believe that the teachings of powerlessness could be responsible for
a big part of that. (And the guilt induction and shaming cause more of it.)

<p>
There was a time when I believed that I was powerless over
alcohol and tobacco, so I thought that it was hopeless, and there was no point in
trying to quit &#8212; just stay stoned and kill the pain until the bitter end comes.
<p>
Fortunately, when the brown stuff was really hitting the fan and the doctor told
me to quit drinking or die &#8212; choose one &#8212; I somehow found the determination
to not die that way.
And now, with 20-20 hindsight, I can say, of course I have the power.
I always had the power. I just didn't know it.

<p>
The other thing is your statement that &quot;Many people become sober without AA.&quot;
That is the understatement of the week. The Harvard Medical School said that
80% of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year or more
did it alone, on their own, without any treatment or support group. <i>Eighty percent</i>.
If that were an election, you would call it an overwhelming landslide.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">Link here</a>.)

<p>
Oh yeh, and isn't that Al-Anon thing appalling? I think that Al-Anon has to be
about the worst psychotherapy in the world.
Here are two good links:
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Al_Anon" target="_blank">here</a>
 and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Good luck on your book. And have a good day.

Dammit Orange,

The more I look at your work the more I am impressed. Now just how did you
get a picture of Bill W. sitting with Lois with his mouth curved so he
looks,... Messed UP? That is funny. And man oh man you must have donated
allot of time to this cause. Now how can we get the message out. Never mind.
You are a propaganda expert and I mean that in a GOOD Way. Let's drink to
Bill being a nut. He probably thought a.a. would fail at least once he died
and asked for a drink on his death bed or is that just embellished A.A.

Okay, I found the smart place will check it out. What about this saying that
they have in Treatment and A.A. YOU HAVE TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF &#8212; IT WON'T
WORK IF YOU ARE DOING IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE. Another selfish thought. My kids
had been takin away because I was using too many drugs and thought I was
powerless to stop. In treatment they told me I could never stop unless it
was for me. This didn't sit well with me and I said, I have to take care of
my kids and I will get them back. Now you don't know the hell I went through
to get those kids back because the child and family social worker back then
thought I was different from an alcoholic because I wouldn't cry in front of
her. And she also said because I took ONE valium that I was cheating, and
A.A. said I wasn't going to make it because I was doing it for my kids and
not myself. Talk about mixed messages. Man oh man. Those fuckers make me mad
just thinking back to that shit.

I hope you are getting these. You don't have to print them, I just think you
are somebody to float (is that A.A. or N.A.) something with, You are
wonderful. Do you remember in A.A. &amp; N.A. everybody trying to be sicker than
the rest. As per example. I started drinking when I was 16, next person, I
started drinking when I was 10, hard stuff.  Then a little later, I started
drinking when I was 6, my dad made me and he gave me drugs.  A little later,
well I was born a drug addict and an alcoholic and I started using from the
womb. When I came into this world I was put on Adha meds. So I took Ritalin
for a buzz, then booze was bottlefed me because I liked it. (too be honest
now when I look at it, I think so many people are bad parents and alcoholics
and drug addicts because they get sent to a meeting and told that THEY CAN'T
STOP, and believe it and go on to be worse) There is no alternative so this
is what they believe. This is how I thought for years. Oh no, the more I
look at it the more I believe A.A. and N.A. has caused a crisis in America
and Canada. Don't know about other countries, but I'm sure it has, think
about it. To be sure it has probable caused many crisis, Rarely have we seen
a person fail, that makes me physically sick now to read it and type it.
Well not physically (A.A. exaggeration) but almost.

I just watched the Lois Wilson biography a couple of months ago with Wynona

kids, you are half a woman. I won't have heirs so I must drink because this
is disturbing.  Shut up and support me you dumb na&iuml;ve bitch, you're half a

never understand what was wrong with that woman, other than be married to an
Asshole. But I guess back in that time it was a really bad thing if you
couldn't have kids. Most of the men had gone to war and died so I guess just
hanging on to your piece of meat (as my mom used to say) was a big deal.

Subject:  	The suicide thing<br>

<p>
I went to A.A. quite a few years ago to give my sister her 8 year cake.
While there, there was this guy with a really big mouth. She told me how one
of his sponsees had recently committed suicide after something like 25
years. I was pretty shocked, then she also said that the guy's wife had let
the A.A. man speak at the suicidal guy's funeral and the guy called the
suicide guy down to the ground for killing himself. (at his own funeral)
She also told me &quot;lots&quot; of people kill themselves after 20 years or so, it
is the hump thing. This made me feel so sad. She also told me about her
group, where they kicked out a guy because he was on Anti depressants. I
asked her how they could do this, they aren't doctors. She told me it was,
&quot;the group consciousness&quot; and that any group could put it forward that they
wanted nobody on meds. When I finished saying a little bit at her cake
thing, the guy whose sponsee had died came up to me and asked me, &quot;What A.A.
group do you belong to?&quot;  I told him I wasn't a member and didn't go to A.A.
anymore, he looked at me like I was dirt after that.  He started sort of
spinning out and backing away from me and saying in a loud voice, &quot;this
person is WRONG, she doesn't even go to A.A.&quot; It was embarrassing. And
sickening.  And makes me mad at A.A. even more that they let some yahoos go
nuts and tell everyone what to do.

<p>
You know I think A.A. may help to point but that kind of quackery just made
my stomach turn. The saddest thing though was that my sisters seemed to think
it was quite alright. It made me sad, so sad.

<p>
That's actually incorrect. I don't know if Hitler was a nonsmoker, but he definitely
drank and ate meat. Hitler &quot;attempted to avoid red meat&quot; in order to help with
intestinal irritation and troubles &#8212; but one of his favorite dishes was pigeon, and
he often ate Bavarian sausage.

<p>
Moreover, Hitler put to death vegetarians as political threats. It's an
often-overlooked fact: I know more than a handful of people who don't know that
Hitler also tortured, experimented on, and killed gays and lesbians as well (my Oma,
who was seven when the war started, has shown and told me of a &quot;bar&quot; that was a
friendly hangout for gay men &#8212; and how many gay men were openly gay; there was a
stigma mostly in religious and medical cases. Hitler's influence stopped a lot of
that). Furthermore, he had slaughterhouses on the premises of the concentration
camps. Himmler attempted to desensitize most of the SS circle into further brutality
by having them observe and participate in slaughterhouses because, guess what? A
fucking psychopath.

<p>
Snopes actually had a page on this, but it seems to have gone down within the past

Hi Em Dot,

There goes another urban legend. Hitler not really a vegetarian?

<p>
hey there... Agent!

<p>
one good friend of mine introduced me to your website (sorry if you
find misspellings or wrong grammar, i'm mexican) and let me tell you
that I feel such relief now... I mean, I've always known that the
meetings are insanely intense...

<p>
I will tell my story...

<p>
when I was 19 I was forced to my first rehab by my parents... They
spent a whole lot of money to get me sober... back then my only
interest in life was to party hard... and they didn't agree, like any
other parent... so ther I was, 19 year old girl in a rehab center in
mexico with all male junkies... To tell you the truth I found it
really fun.. It was like a hotel and they gave us A LOT of food... we
had meditations, meetings therapy... you know... the funny thing is...
i just took it like a vacation, time off from school and my family...
the only thing that really broke my heart into little pieces was to
see my family suffering... So I just wanted them to feel better... so
this is what I did... from the first day I was there I noticed that
all the staff were former junkies.. We read the big book everyday, I
had a little knowledge of the 12 steps before then because my dad went
to rehab also for alcohol...

<p>
(he's been sober to this day I'm guessing 25 years now, but he doesn't
go to meetings anymore, I think he went to meetings for about a year
or so... so I have no memory of him going to meetings, nor him trying
to shove the program in my mind, i think he went to rehab to give my
mom piece of mind and stayed sober just because, like you said, he
didn't want to drink anymore, as simple as that... he doesn't go to
church either)

<p>
ok, so I had this knowledge.. AND it didn't take for me to long to
know how to talk to this people in that rehab center... it was so
obvious, all the made up phrases and everything... so I knew exactly
what to say... &quot;yes, i can't control my self, I just can't have just
ONE drink&quot; &quot;i did pretty messed up things, im sick&quot; &quot;i think i found
my higher power last night in meditation&quot; and the reality was nothing
had happened to me, i just liked to party A LOT, maybe more than
necessary, I decided to go with the flow with the steps, so my family
would feel better, and the &quot;therapists&quot; could tell my mom that her
daughter was doing GREAT... so I managed... so I got out of my first
rehab and they made me an example, so young &quot;you're lucky you found
the program so soon&quot;

<p>
went back home... managed to stay sober and went to meetings and
everything.. to keep my family at ease... then i relapsed because I
really wanted to party some more!... I mean I was 20.. that's all you
want to do... I was in a very protected society.. and everything... I
really didn't have any deep shit going on... not compared to anything
that i've heard from the meetings and rehab... some hard core shit...
rape, murder, stealing, bla bla

<p>
so i decided to party a little longers &#8212; obviously my family found
out... you know in mexico you live with your parents until you get
married, so i lived with my parents, and they found out that i've
relapsed....

<p>
then it wasn't fun anymore... all the partying... for me the scary
thing was that i didn't care about anything and then some shit started
to happen... but i didn't want to end up like the people i met
before... so one day i told my mom... hey i gotta go to rehab again, i
gotta stop NOW because I REALLY don't know where I'm going to end up
and that scares the shit out of me... so I went back to rehab, on my
own... and the meetings and everything... It was the only resource I
knew about then...  so went to rehab again, got out... got sober and
stayed sober... some other shit happened later but didn't relapse...
because i didn't want to... anyway... I finally started to feel
better... I was still coming to the meetings... Like one year after...
got my coin and everything... I was busy graduating from college, so
couldn't go to meetings everyday and I mean.. i've always been kind of
smart without realizing, because I always kept a safe distance with
everyone... didn't talk to much.. about me,,, i talked about random
stuff.. and i saw the pretty intense 12steppers and they made me
depressed... and also... telling me that if i didn't go to meetings
every day i was screwed... that i was not humble and i was very
selfish... and talking bulllshit... sooo i told them this is supposed
to be recovery.... i mean to recover your life... and that's what im
doing...

<p>
i realized that some people there had been sober for years, but the
only thing they did in their lives was coming to the meetings... and
that was that... so that person was a waste for society really...
another unemployed person... so i started to not want to go to
meetings anymore because they made me really mad... they made me so
mad... because they tell you to be humble... when they aren't... and
theeenn i stumbled upon an old friend, from my partying hard past...
and he found sobriety in christianism, and he was so intense!! just
like NA! he talked the same way that these guys screamed at meetings
because that was not talking... besides i heard things that i really
didn't near to hear...

<p>
now im 30... i stayed sober for like 8 years... on my own... now i
drink... but i don't want to party and get super wasted i don't even
like to get drunk... and I don't feel guilty about it... because I
KNOW what i want and what i don't... i don't want to be drunk all the
time... i just like beer hahaha so this friend went through a similar
situation... and he told me that your website helped him not to
relapse... he was about to relapse going to the meetings and that your
website gave him piece of mind... so now im checking it out... and i
love you for that... because there was a little AA voice in me telling
me that im sick and without meetings i would end up screwing up again
just like when i was 20 and immature, even if i know that im smarter
than that.. there was this little voice... the tiny guilt...

<p>
thank you, im planning on keep on reading your essays... that's a lot
of reading ahead of me... haha

<p>
thanks again<br>
Barbara

<p>
PS.<br>
please use Barbara for my name,  I'd really appreciate it!!!<br>

<font color="blue">
Hi Barbara,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It makes a lot of sense. I'm glad to hear that you 
are doing well. You know, from the sound of things, you might not be
an alcoholic at all &#8212; just a normal girl who liked to party a lot when she
was younger.
And now you have matured out of reckless behavior, and drink moderately and safely.
So it goes. That's called &quot;being normal&quot;.
<p>
As far as getting sick on alcohol goes, alcohol is poisonous to everybody.
Anybody who drinks too much alcohol will get sick and stop caring about things.
That's just what it does to people.
<p>
I'm glad that you and your friend were able to get something useful out of
my web site.
<p>
So have a good day and a good life now.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Tom,
<p>
Well, to start with your subject line at the top, &quot;Your Rap is So Old&quot;:
Well then, why don't you just change the channel? Turn off the computer and turn
on the TV and watch something mindless and comforting?

<p>
Then you keep harping on &quot;government-assisted housing&quot;.
You have been complaining about that for years.
The only way in which my previous apartment
was government-assisted was that the owners managed
to get a tax break.
<p>
What happened was, a bunch of investors got together and decided to build a
Chinese highrise in Chinatown. They even decorated the building with Chinese
symbols and all of that. Well, it didn't work. The Chinese didn't like the
building and very few moved in. The owners asked, &quot;Now what do we do?&quot;

<p>
They decided to get a fat tax break by having certified low-income people in the
building. But they didn't bother to pass on much of the savings. I am now paying
$145 per month less for a larger apartment that has nothing to do with the
government and is not in any way &quot;government-assisted&quot;.
<p>
There was no fire hazard. As you pointed out, I have lived 63 years, and I
haven't stupidly killed myself yet, so I know what I am doing. I am also
an old computer professional, so I know how to wire up a computer network without
burning down the house.

<p>
And, I didn't actually get kicked out of the building. The new Czarina of the
Tower was threatening to terminate the lease if I didn't get rid of a lot of
possessions in two weeks. I decided that I was not going to pay good money
to live under such conditions. You can see what the other tenants had to say
about her and her new management style here:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322003637/http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/OR-Portland-Pacific-Tower.html" target="_blank">
http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/OR-Portland-Pacific-Tower.html</a>.

<p>
And then it took a lot longer than I expected to find a good place to sign a year lease on.
So what?<br>
And part of the time, I slept in a homeless shelter rather than sleep in the rain.
So what?<br>
And other times, I did sleep in the rain. I don't mind camping out.
I actually like it. I just dislike
the illegal aspect, where it is possible to get ticketed for it.<br>
And the mud did get old. Rain isn't too bad, but the mud on everything gets old.

<p>
The rest of your rap is just the same old garbage. I don't enjoy hate mail,
and your rap is getting old. So why don't you give it a rest and go watch TV?
This web site is about alcoholism and recovery, and escape from cults, and things
like that.

Have a good day.

Subject:  	Another interesting ingredient in the C.C. pills<br>

<p>
Hi again!

<p>
I wrote you last year (I think?) about the mercury compound in the C.C. pills. Now,
I've found yet another funny ingredient &#8212; the colocynth extract! See 1 Growth
(Wikipedia link) for instance.

<p>
Its fruit, which is [...] extremely bitter, is a powerful hepatic stimulant and
hydragogue cathartic. It is used as a strong laxative. In overdoses, the fruit can
cause violent, sharp pains in the bowels, with dangerous inflammation.

<p>
Now this is some powerful cathartic! I'd be seeing funny things after praying to the
Porcelain God for a few days straight, too...

<p>

Petri

Hi again, Petri,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. Thanks for the information.

<p>
Wow. Dr. Silkworth was really poisoning alcoholics with his
 &quot;belladonna cure&quot;, wasn't he?
And A.A. members love to rave about what a saint he was. No, he wasn't.
More like an incompetent doctor who allowed his name to be used by Bill Wilson
for publicizing a cult religion quack cure.

<p>
And
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">Charlie Towns'
&quot;cure for morphine addiction (and alcoholism, and everything else)&quot;</a>
was so bad that a more reputable doctor quit Charlie Towns' hospital
and would not have anything more to do with his &quot;belladonna cure&quot;.
That was Dr. Alexander Lambert, professor of clinical medicine at
Cornell University Medical College and a visiting physician to Bellevue
Hospital. Dr. Lambert was also one of then-President Theodore Roosevelt's
physicians.
<p>
Well, Dr. Lambert noticed that the belladonna cure was not working at all,
and the addicts and alcoholics just kept coming back for another cure, year after year.
Dr. Lambert then dissociated himself from Charles Towns and his hospital.

<p>
But Dr. Silkworth kept right on dosing those morphine addicts and alcoholics anyway.
<p>
And why was Dr. Silkworth dosing people with so many laxatives and purgatives?<br>
Why was the cure for everything to get people to shit their guts out?<br>
There is just something a little weird about that.
(Did Silkworth have an anal fixation?)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

You are quite welcome !  Could you please read this and provide feedback?<br>
Thx

<p>
I have been sober in AA for 16 years and, in all that time, I have not
seriously come out of the bubble to look around for different perspectives
on recovery. I have recently found Orange, and others,  and admit they have
valid perspectives and solid arguments and evidence around the vast majority
of debated recovery issues.

<p>
My main concern revolves around the concept of powerlessness over alcohol
and people, places and things. I am convinced that the concept is very
damaging if it penetrates the psyche and becomes part  of the belief system.
If I truly believe I am powerless over everything, how hard would I try at
&quot;living&quot;? How does this belief manifest itself in my world view and
motivation to do anything?  If I have no personal power, why should I even
begin to take on the challenges of everyday living? I can't affect outcomes
so why try at all?  Leaving the &quot;God will do it for you&quot; part of the
deception out of this for a moment, let me provide a situation to illustrate
how damaging powerlessness can be.

<p>
Let's begin with a fresh new baby and two possible timelines (paths) that
the baby could use to grow up. The first path is one where the baby grows up
and internalizes that it is powerless over people, places and things.
Completely powerless.  Do life, but you have no control over the outcomes.
(If you want to take it further, raise the child with the added idea that
their thought processes are broken and that their actual thinking will lead
them nowhere good.) Now, what type of operational adult do you have when it
reaches adulthood?  Is it more, or less likely to be a contributing member
of society? Or, is this creature that believes it has no power over anything
more likely to be a ward of the state? Use your imagination here. Just what
is the behavioral profile of someone who truly believes they are powerless
over people, places and things? Is this person the ultimate victim of
circumstances? Is this person more or less likely to be taken advantage of?

<p>
OK, now let's look at the other timeline. On this one the child is taught
that they have varied degrees of  power over people, places and things. They
are responsible for their behavior and its effects on themselves and others.
 That they can achieve great things in life precisely because they do have
this personal power and responsibility. That their thoughts and actions have
value and are valued by others when used creatively and constructively. That
they can directly and indirectly affect outcomes and it is their right and
duty to use their talents for the best possible outcome for themselves and
society. So, what kind of person is this? What is their behavioral profile?
Are they more or less likely to be contributing members of society than the
person on the other timeline?  Are they likely to be victims or leaders?

<p>
There is one major personal question that comes out of this comparison;
&quot;Which one  would I rather be?&quot; If you honestly answered, &quot;the one with
personal power and responsibility&quot;, and you are in AA, you must force
yourself to become awake. I am giving a dire warning here. In AA, if you
internalize their teachings around powerlessness, you significantly reduce
your chances to become the person on the second timeline. The powerlessness
concept is insidious and it will affect you regardless of how resistant you
may think you are. There is no immunity against repetition over time &#8212; none.

<p>
For me, the dilution of my internal drive happened over time so I speak from
a perspective that is unfortunately aided by extended immersion in the
negative powerlessness concepts of AA. It appears highly unlikely that
anyone can separate the teachings and apply some of them to various areas of
life. For example, when taught that you are powerless over people, places
and things, you can't just be powerless over alcohol. Over time, that
training bleeds out into every aspect of life. Think deeply about this
because it is very important to survival. &quot;Powerless over everything&quot; can
possibly easily translate into &quot;I can't do anything about anything&quot; and if
that is coupled with &quot;I have a broken brain and it will never get better&quot;,
you have the perfect mental storm for anyone that is already unstable and
remotely suicidal. Who would want to live if you knew that you had no power
over anything and were basically incapable of ever thinking straight?

<p>
For parents of troubled teens, please consider very carefully what is being
said here. If your child has a problem with alcohol and/or drugs, your
choice of a treatment program will affect your child for the rest of their
life. Do you want them to live as a powerless person with an imaginary
disease? Or, do you want them to live with the knowledge that they are
personally powerful and responsible for their actions?

<p>
I think the answer is clear.

<font color="blue">
Hi PJ,
<p>
Yes, I think the answer is clear too.
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You said a lot, and said it well.
<p>
I have to agree that teaching powerlessness is one of the worst aspects of
Alcoholics Anonymous, and it causes a lot of alcoholics to fail to get sober,
and even causes some of them to die.
<p>
<blockquote>
The A.A. true believers cry that I am being unfair and extremist when I say
that A.A. causes alcoholics to die, but the evidence is good.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma found that A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. George Vaillant found that A.A. increased the death rate</a>.
I'm sure that some of that is caused by teaching alcoholics that they
are diseased and powerless and can't control their drinking.
If you really are powerless, then failure is likely.
</blockquote>
<p>
It occurred to me that we are seeing this &quot;powerless&quot; teaching happening on
several different levels of society, in several different ways.
<p>
In the socio-economic realm, the poor and middle-class children are taught to
go to school so that they can get a good job (working for somebody else).<br>
The rich people's children are taught from birth that they will be the next
generation of bosses, executives, captains, and kings, who rule the stupid working masses.
<p>
And what happens? The poor and middle class children become wage slaves whose
jobs are exported to China, and the rich people's children become the executives
who export those jobs to China, and get gigantic bonuses for doing so.
<p>
Yes, teaching powerlessness or powerfulness really works.
<p>
In the religious realm,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#powerless" target="_blank">
Dr. Frank Buchman taught that people were &quot;defeated by sin&quot;</a>,
and powerless over it, and the only answer was:
&quot;You must surrender to God&quot;, and hope
that God will make a well-behaved puppet out of you.
And what happened? They ended up becoming enormously deceptive, dishonest,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#evasive" target="_blank">evasive</a>,
deceitful people who admired Hitler and the Nazis.

<p>
Coincidentally, we were just discussing powerlessness in some of the previous letters:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters175.html#powerless1" target="_blank">
&quot;...the steps... encourage
people to accept powerlessness and expect people to turn
their recovery over to God.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters175.html#powerless2" target="_blank">
&quot;You can be powerless over your reaction to an angry person...&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters175.html#powerless3" target="_blank">
'&quot;let go and let god&quot; is actually a way of
moving people out of old, dsyfunctional patterns of
control-oriented behavior and into an open-ended mindset in
which uncertainty is tolerated.'</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters175.html#powerless4" target="_blank">
&quot;The idea of powerlessness has now been disputed by many psychiatrists as
dangerous and self-defeating.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters175.html#powerless5" target="_blank">
&quot;About powerlessness. Yes, indeed. I think that is one of the worst aspects of
A.A. and Buchmanism.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters172.html#powerless" target="_blank">
I &quot;realize that I am not powerless at all.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters170.html#powerless" target="_blank">
&quot;Bill W describes this type of thinking by comparing it to a
person with a passion for J-walking.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters170.html#powerless2" target="_blank">
...&quot;being unable to bring into consciousness with sufficient force
the awfulness of what happened last time drinking...&quot;</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters167.html#powerless" target="_blank">
&quot;I couldn't admit I was powerless and was told I was, regardless...&quot;</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters167.html#powerless2" target="_blank">
&quot;However you come into the system, you are diseased and
powerless and if you resist these labels, you are in denial.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters.html#solution3" target="_blank">We are not powerless</a>.

</ol>
<p>
In summation, all that I can say is, &quot;I thank God that She did not
make me powerless.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life now.
