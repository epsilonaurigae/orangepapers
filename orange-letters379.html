Subject:  	Nuremburg trials....<br>

<p>
So, I'm reading the wiki article on Hans Bernd Gisevius, a German official
and member of the German Resistance.  If you don't know him, he served as a
main prosecution witness in the trial Goering &amp; as a defense witness for
Hjalmar Schacht.  He also was the diplomat in Switzerland who took meetings
with Dulles and negotiations with the Vatican.

<p>
Anyways, at the end of the article, there are links for YouTube vids of the
Nuremberg Trials footage.  I have no idea if the Doctor's Trials footage is
part of it, but there are at least 115 days worth of footage (I don't think
it's highlights).

<p>
On a lark, you should type &quot;Nuremberg Day&quot; and the name (both or just last)
of your target and see if anything pops.  I'd do it, but I can't remember
the guy's name.

<p>
Anyways.  Thought you'd appreciate the idea.

<p>
Take care and I hope to see you soon.

Hello D.,
<p>
Thanks for the info.
<p>
To the readers: This is about the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials of the Nazi doctors
who conducted horrendous &quot;scientific&quot; experiments on Jews and other prisoners.
In particular, it's about
<a href="orange-letters374.html#Himmler" target="_blank">the Karl Gebhardt who was
mentioned earlier as testifying that Heinrich Himmler was taught about herbal cures,
mesmerism, and hom&oelig;opathy by his new wife</a>,
who had been working as a nurse in a Berlin clinic.

<p>
I got the book  <i>Croix gamm&eacute;e contre caduc&eacute;e
&#8212; Les Experiences Humaines En Allemagne Pendant La Deuxieme Guerre
Mondiale</i>, by Francois Bayle, through an interlibrary loan. 

It verifies the previous statement about Himmler's wife,
but doesn't say anything about Himmler getting converted
to the Buchmanite religion.
The author Gerald Reitlinger wrote in &quot;<i>the SS, alibi of a nation, 1922-1945</i>&quot;
that &quot;It was widely reported towards the year 1935 that she had converted Himmler to the
Buchmanite movement.&quot;

<p>
Alas, the author did not seem to think that such &quot;widely reported&quot;
information needed a footnote.  Oh how I wish there was one, or several. I need
to track down some of those widespread sources.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br>

<p>
(You can post this letter.)

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I really hope you are feeling better. I know it's hard enough,
especially in the winter.

<p>
I have to object to the letter by antidenial about me as posted in
your letters section where she called me a bully, among other things. What she
said makes it sound like I was the one being homophobic and nothing could be
further from the truth. It borders on libel on a site that gets millions of
hits per month.

<p>
Antidenial's letter also makes it sound like I might be
anti-Christian. That's not true either. I also welcome all perspectives on AA,
atheists and religious views alike. In fact, I initially defended Jim when he
was being attacked for being a Christian. And I remained neutral about his
plans until I knew more about them.

<p>

<p>
It was Jim Battle who was bashing, not only LGBT, but interfaith
marriages, Buddhists (also in another post), certain churches and bashing other
Christians he views as evildoers because they practice tolerance, saying they
are lower than gang members who will kill you. He is talking about threatening
the churches, exposing them as &quot;evildoers&quot;, and even talks about suing them.
The list goes on and on. This is offensive to good &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; type of
Christians. He's not going to get many friends like that. A spirit of
cooperation would go a lot further than making the kinds of &quot;demands&quot; he's
talking about. In fact, his approach could make people all the more defensive
of AA.

<p>
Here's his post. Please note the time stamp of 11/20. The original
post was on 11/13, as you can clearly see by the timestamps of the responses. Nobody
changed his comments but him, and he was editing it for days, trying to make it seem
more palatable. The original
version specified the people he didn't think should be welcome in churches AT
ALL, which he later changed to &quot;members&quot;. You can scroll up to see what he was
responding to. You can see this when Pennywise quoted him just below.

<p>

<p>
I simply object to Battlesetting himself up as our leader
while refusing to share more about his belief system, when that system could be
used to discredit him, and by association, discredit us. That's what my
signature is about. There are others who feel this way, and they are in the
majority, which is obvious if you read the thread.  I also feel others who
didn't see his original unedited post should know what exactly they are
aligning themselves with and not run blindly into this thing. I'd also like to
add that Battleis anti-psychiatry and anti-psychology, as well.

<p>

http://www.theflamingtorch.org/archives/2001/iam.htm</a>

<p>
It's a 12 page long thread, but if you read even some of  it, it will be clear
that we were objecting to Battle's intolerance and simply stating that we
weren't going to follow him.

<p>
Here's my first comment on that particular thread regarding the
matter.

<p>
(Please note that my disclaimer wasn't added until much later.)

<p>

<p>
Here's where antidenial started with her personal attacks
immediately after.

<p>

<p>
If you scroll down a bit you can also see that Avo tried to
capture what Battle said by copy and paste, but this was only AFTER and BECAUSE
we were aware that he repeatedly edited his original comment.

<p>
Here's Ben quoting Battle's attacks on churches

<p>

<p>
Then they had the nerve to accuse us of being intolerant and
calling us bigots because we didn't want to tolerate Jim's hate. Nice reversal
of reality. There's a load of projection going on here.

<p>
<p>
Here's more.

<p>

<p>
Here's where antidenial made this about being anti-Christian,
rather than anti-hate, which has become a main theme for them:

<p>

<p>
The members of the forum repeatedly expressed that Battle has the right to his
beliefs and to
express them on the forum and elsewhere, but that we equally have the right to
know what his positions are, and to not follow him based on our objections to
those beliefs. Here's only one of many posts stating such:
<p>

<p>
The tactics they plan to use against churches were also objected
to:

<p>

<p>
And here's Avogadno stating her objections as a Christian:

<p>

<p>
Battle's feeling that his hateful attitudes
should remain unquestioned is a huge red flag. He wants a blind and
unconditional following. His attitudes and other religious bigots he aligns
himself with can be researched by anybody (they are referenced in his tract),
just as people did on that thread, and can easily be used to discredit the
cause of exposing AA. In other words, someone like Battlecan do this movement harm.
<p>
This
isn't about Christianity or any other religion; it's specifically about
hate-mongering forms of religion in general and it's a really bad idea to align
yourself with hate-mongering.

<p>
Another problem I have is that Battle is speaking in a public arena and
linking back to the Orangepapers, which links to the forum, which links to the rest
of us
personally. I have every right to distance myself from whatever I'm offended by
and that's the reason for my signature. And it also reflects that the majority
of the members of the forum feel the same way, as they expressed themselves on
that thread and others.

<p>
The funny thing here is that I have REPEATEDLY asked antidenial
why she still hasn't featured Battle and his bus on HER website. She has
never answered that question. It would appear that even Battle's number 1 defender
and cheerleader
wants to keep a degree of separation from him, while attacking us for openly
stating we don't support him. She wants this to all play out on your forum and
not hers; even though she could delete any comments she wants to.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005227/http://nadaytona.org/" target="_blank">
http://nadaytona.org/</a>

<p>
The claims that we are trying to silence anybody is patently absurd
when you actually read the thread. Nobody is trying to stop them from what they
are planning to do, either. And you should know personally that I've never
called to have Battle or antidenial banned.

<p>
Since antidenial's letter has been published on your site, with no
supporting evidence of her accusations, I hope that you will publish this one,
since I have supported my claims. I have only written this in response since I
found her letter on your site. I deserve the right to defend myself. And I have
the right to defend myself from being lumped in with Battle. I'd also like to point
out that you
are losing a lot of members over this, and I can prove that as well if you wish. I
have many  posts saved if you'd like to see them.

<p>
Thank you so much for the opportunity to clear my name,<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Causeandeffect,
<p>
Yes, there is far too much bitterness and hostility in the forum right now.
I really hope that people can calm down.
<p>
In particular, when we are confronted with ideas that we find repugnant, like
narrow-minded homophobia, we don't have to go non-linear. My favorite
response is to mention the fact that Jesus never acted in a bigoted or
narrow-minded way. Think about the woman at the well, or the prostitute about
to get stoned to death.  Jesus was very tolerant of others' shortcomings.
 Also, it was the Jewish
tradition to not enter the house of a non-Jew, lest the Jew be &quot;defiled&quot;
by the &quot;unclean&quot; house.  But Jesus entered the houses of non-Jews and
sinners all of the time, and was even nice to Romans. I wish more
Christians would follow that example.
<p>
I would like to think that the forum can survive one preacher espousing his
version of Christianity. If not, is it a forum?

<p>
If the forum is nothing but a group of like-minded people who parrot their favorite
sayings back and forth to each other, then that isn't a forum.  It's an echo box.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.
<p>

Subject:  	Past email<br>

<p>
I see you are not to active on your post. The last one I sent you is not
up. You do not need to post it. I have been posting on the Forum. I am not
sure if I am saying the right thing. But I am giving it a try anyway. I
hope all is well with you. I think this is taking off pretty well. The Jim
Battle thing is a bit odd. But it is generating more activity. I am not
sure what his agenda is. There was a young guy in the rooms that was into
the Christian evangelical thing. I tried to talk to him, but all he did was
try to get me to accept Jesus. There was no give and take. It is all one
way. Kind of like AA. Oh well, have a nice day.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bill,
<p>
I'm active in my posting, just slow. Events sometimes conspire to keep me from
the library and posting updates, like sciatica and freezing weather. But I won't
let it keep me down.
<p>
Some days, I just feel like hibernating. I think I still have some bear genes in me.
It's December. What am I doing awake?
<p> 
Yes, there has been quite a furor in the forum lately.  Well, to a certain extent,
I think that it's in the nature of forums. If it's a real free marketplace of ideas,
then sooner or later you will have someone saying things that you don't like.
<p>
But I have my own kind of faith: I believe in freedom of speech. I think that we get
the best outcomes when all ideas can be freely expressed, and we are free to judge,
consider, disagree, criticize, or accept. Whatever. I am reminded of the Nazi regime
and Communist countries where free speech and freedom of the press were not allowed.
Or crazy Islamic or military dictatorships in the Middle East right now. One of the first signs
that your country is going to Hell is when freedom of the press and freedom of speech,
are curtailed by some &quot;higher authority&quot; (often for &quot;good reasons&quot;).
<p>
Now, about religious proselytizing:
One of the biggest problems that I have with evangelists is that they just want
to make you agree with them. They want to &quot;convert&quot; you to their beliefs.
Often, they need the emotional support of being surrounded by dozens of parrots who all say
the same thing. And they don't want to learn the truth. They will vehemently insist
that they already have the truth, so they don't need to learn the truth, and they will 
refuse to look at facts or evidence which might change their beliefs.
<p> 
To anyone who even vaguely believes in science or reason or logic, it seems inconceivable
for some people to reject the evidence in front of their eyes, and just &quot;believe&quot; something else.
Indeed, it is a kind of insanity.
<p>
Nevertheless, I think it's better to hear them than censor them.
<p>
Have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	I owe you orange<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
I have been meaning to write a letter to you for some time. A year and a half ago I
googled &quot;AA is a cult&quot; and was linked to your site. I spent about three years in AA.
During this time I was consistently told &quot;what I needed to hear&quot; which was often
that I was &quot;pathetic, crazy and worthless.&quot; I unfortunately believed that, devoted
my life to the program and lost my motivation and some close friends. I frequently
thought of suicide, yet sadly believed I could cure my unhappiness by listening to
the terrible advice from other members. Anyway I lost it after a close friend died
of an overdose and I became very depressed as I often do anyway in the late winter.
I heard from members of the cult that &quot;he was a loser who chose not to work the
program&quot; and that I shouldn't be sad in should see that &quot;god killed him to save
others.&quot; My depression was apparently from not working the program and not listening
to the insulting feedback I was given. I was told meds were a relapse and
unfortunately was brainwashed enough to listen.
<p>
 Fortunately my shrink suggested I
leave the program and I found your site. Anyway, a year and a half later I have an
awesome group of true friends, got into graduate school and am finally happy after
years of misery. Oh, and I tried moderate drinking and guess what? As I originally
believed opiates were my problem not alcohol. And I now take medication that
keeps me from becoming depressed. Thank you for helping me save my life and my
sanity.
<p>
Also on a side note I wanted to say how powerful the brainwashing from treatment
centers is. My sister has been to 10 or so rehabs and despite that I have shown
my parents the studies on your site each time they visit her they become true
believers who think that the problem lies in her not truly getting step one. My
parents are smart, rational and successful people yet have become brainwashed
repeatedly.
<p>
Anyway, thank you happy holidays.
<p>

Hello Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and I'm so happy to hear that you are feeling better, and out
of the madness (A.A. madness, I mean).

<p>
This letter really makes my day. It's very encouraging to hear that someone actually benefitted
from reading the web site. Every so often, especially now in the gray winter, I think about
retiring from the scene and letting others do it. But then I get a letter like yours and it
tells me that this project is still worth doing.

<p>
About your parents, again, I'm reminded of the quote,<br>
<b>&quot;Smart people are very good at rationalizing things
they came to believe for non-smart reasons.&quot;</b>
<p>
I don't know who said that, but it's so true.

<p>
About your parents' belief that your sister should &quot;get&quot; Step One:  I'd ask them where
you would be if you were really powerless over alcohol? Or powerless over drugs?
You would probably be dead.
<p>
And I'd ask your parents why you succeeded in getting healthy
only after you rejected the 12 Steps and all of the associated beliefs?
You got better when you stopped believing that you were powerless over drugs and alcohol.
You got better when you stopped believing that you were
&quot;pathetic, crazy and worthless.&quot;
Now why is that?
<p>
Ask your parents how much they are paying for the quack medicine that your sister is getting. 
Then ask them how many lies old ex-convicts and drug addicts will tell to get that much money.
<p>
Lastly, I wonder whether your parents are getting fooled by the trappings of authority.
(See
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#authorities" target="_blank">Appeal to Authorities &#8212;
<i>Argumentum ad Verecundiam</i></a>.) 
The people who run rehab centers prop themselves up as the &quot;experts on addiction&quot;,
real know-it-all authorities on the subject, which they are not.
They are just crooks who sell quack medicine, and make a whole lot of money doing it.
<p>
Your parents should understand that the FDA does not regulate treatments for addictions.
The field is wide open for all kinds of con artists and frauds.
The FDA regulates medications.
If the rehab center were to sell an unlicensed pill to cure alcoholism,
then the FDA would be down on them like a ton of bricks.
But the treatment center could take your sister to a roller-skating rink and
make her skate around in circles as her &quot;treatment&quot;, and that would be legal.
Or they could sell her an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties
as a cure, and that would be okay. It's completely legal.

<p>
Good luck. And have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
Hi again orange.
<p>
 Thanks for your response. It made me smile to hear it made your day.
You said that you're glad to hear someone was helped and I wanted to reply to let
you know I think you've helped a lot of people. I didn't mention this in the
previous letter but I have one friend who was being abused by an outpatient 12 step
program. I sent him a link to your site. His parents saw the Vaillant study and
immediately sent him to a non 12 step treatment which according to him was CBT based
and he has told me he's off the hard drugs.
<p>
 Another friend was in the cult longer
than I was. He was very far gone, went to extremely intense and abusive men's only
meetings and was very abusive toward me even after I left AA. In anger I sent him a
link to the site and told him to read it. He has left AA, stayed completely sober
and is now one of my best friends. He is more relaxed and has said he is very
thankful he left AA. Don't give up, you make a huge difference.
<p>
As for my sister and parents I'm not sure anything at the moment will change
their minds. I tried very hard to show them the studies after my sister was
assaulted by a sex offender at her halfway house last year and even that
didn't make a difference. Apparently the creep just wasn't working his
program. Why they let ex con perverts in the halfway houses is beyond me. And
putting myself in other members shoes had I seen your site 9 months prior to
when I did you probably would have received a letter full of as hominem
attacks by a true believer unwilling to see the truth. Oh well keep up the
good work.

Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the happy stories. They are good news.
I'm sorry to hear about your sister. The way that some people
can be so stubborn just amazes and appalls me. I scratch my head and ask,
&quot;What will it take? To get some people to wake up and see and change their minds?&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

Broken Bird Feeder 
</center>
The plastic loop on the right, by which the feeder hangs, is broken. It's highly likely
that a hungry squirrel did it. After eating all of the sunflower seeds on the ground, he or she
still wanted more, so it climbed up the tree, out on the branch, and then down the feeder to
get into it. The extra weight broke the weak, cold, brittle, plastic loop, and it fell.
And the squirrel probably fell with it. Then the squirrel
happily scooped out all of the sunflower seeds, and feasted.

<p>
A book that I have been reading about backyard bird feeders calls squirrels "destructive".
I disagree, in spite of the breakage. The squirrels are just trying to get something more to
eat. You can't blame them for that. Besides, the fix was easy. I just made a new loop out of stiff
wire, and hung it back up, refilled with sunflower seeds. Oh, and I also put more sunflower seeds
and rolled oats out on the ground, where the squirrel could get them.

This might be the culprit. It's right underneath the sunflower seed feeder.

Subject:  	What's good about AA: I was pleased to see this list. It adds credibility
to your criticisms of AA because, as you point out, there must be some reason so many
people hang out in &quot;the rooms&quot;. You nailed the reasons I go to meetings:
it's always there, it's something to do, and I've made friends with some sane and
interesting women. I do have the ability to recognize cultish behavior, poor
information, and toxic personalities, so I can ignore these things &#8212; or
change up what meetings I choose to attend. In other words, give me credit for
having done plenty of reading and research about addiction. Your inclusion of the
&quot;<a href="orange-whats_good.html" target="_blank">Good about AA</a>&quot;
 list on this site shows some respect for my intelligence.
Thanks for that.<br>

<font color="blue">
Hello Amy,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks.
Yes, we have to consider both sides of any issue if we want to be fair and accurate.
<p>
And I know that not all A.A. members are insane or evil.  I've met some good people there.
<p>
I even have the honorable
&quot;<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">Newcomers Rescue League</a>&quot;,
which consists of sane, good-hearted people who go to A.A. meetings to rescue
newcomers from bad sponsors.

<p>
Unfortunately, there is the other side: <a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>.
And I do believe that A.A. does more harm than good.

<p>
Great to hear back from you as always!

<p>
My parents, and everyone else I talk to when the subject of alcoholism comes
up (which thankfully isn't often) thinks and says that AA is just a wonderful
program. Here in Hawai'i and probably in many parts of the mainland, AA is
really the only support group there is. If it were't for the internet and
your website in particular, I would still be wondering why I felt so at odds
with 'the program'...like 'what's wrong with me that I feel something is wrong
with AA?'

<p>
Anyway, Happy Holidays to you and the goslings... and if you do write a horror novel
based on AA that is scarier than AA itself, I'll buy it! Because THAT'S a horror
story!!
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Ted,
<p>
About your parents, yes, a whole lot of people have been fooled by 70 years of A.A.
propaganda. It's going to take some time to get the truth out.

<p>
About a horror story scarier than A.A.: now that is a real challenge. That would really
require a lot of scary stuff, and maybe vampires and ghouls and...

<p>
Come to think of it, I didn't mention vampires before, did I? Now that would fit. There are lots
of A.A. meetings at night, which a vampire could visit. He could groom his future meals there, and
seduce tonight's dinner.
<p>
And ghouls? They feed on the flesh of dead people. That fits. Or even better would be spiritual
ghouls, who feed on the minds and spirits of people whose minds and spirits are dead. Now I know
I've seen some of them  &#8212;  both kinds, the dead spirits, and the ghouls.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day, and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	Available of Disk?<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Is the Orange Papers website information available on CD/DVD? I would like
to buy one if it is. If NOT then it should be in case something happens to
the site or you.
<p>
Respectfully,
<p>
---Dan


<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi again, Dan,
<p>
Right now, it isn't available on disk. I might get around to burning
a few copies eventually, but haven't done it yet.

<p>
What I recommend is that you burn your own disk. The web site is actually
designed for that.  You will notice that the entire web site is available
in 148 archive files. You just download them, and uncompress them
into a subdirectory, and burn a DVD of the whole thing, archive files
and all.

<p>
It used to be a CD but got too big, so now it's a DVD.

<p>
If you don't have a DVD burner of your own, get a friend to do it.

<p>
Complete instructions for burning the DVD are here:<br>
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters29.html#make_CD" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters29.html#make_CD</a>

<p>
Just substitute &quot;DVD&quot; for &quot;CD&quot;. Those instructions are old.

<p>
Have a good day again, and Merry Christmas.<br>

<p>
Hey Orange,
<p>
JR led me to
<a href="orange-letters30.html#hippie" target="_blank">a section of your letters</a>
where you were asked about your
religious affiliations. I have to say, I think we're from the same planet!
Your hippy response was priceless.
<p>
People always try to shove me into an agnostic or atheist box and neither of them
fit and boy that pisses them off.
<p>
I was born in 61 so I just missed the summer of love although as an 8 year
old, I was already &quot;all in&quot;. I guess my sarcasm and cynicism is a result of
growing up in the early 70's and the realization that the world just wasn't
ready yet for those idealistic ideas.  I miss the improv jams of those
magical bands back from the day.
<p>
In terms of &quot;religious&quot; views, I kind of lean
towards those &quot;imagined&quot; by John! :-&gt;

<p>
Peace out,<br>
Rolf

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rolf,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and of course I couldn't agree more.
It isn't a question of <b>either</b> you are a true believer in a &quot;standard-brand religion&quot;,
<b>or else</b> you are an atheist. There is lot of room inbetween, and there are also other dimensions,
like up/down, left-right.  It sure isn't just a one-dimensional thing.
Just the proliferation of so many slightly-different churches should teach people that.

<p>
By the way, it was Alan Watts who came up with that &quot;standard-brand religion&quot; phrase. I love that one.
It says a lot. (I think it was in <i>The Book</i>, which is another good read.)
<p>
And then of course there are other philosophies like Buddhism and &quot;Hinduism&quot; (really properly named
Vedantic teachings). Buddhism doesn't believe in a God who answers prayers and pulls puppet strings and
makes miracles happen (if you are good enough, or do something to please God enough).
So that would blow a big hole in the beliefs of a lot of the American people.

<p>
And yes, I miss the bands of the sixties too. That kind of music just isn't happening today,
and I don't know quite why. I don't think the kids today are any stupider, so what happened?
(Is it just different drugs? LSD and psychedelics stretch your mind out like taffey, so the songs
get very long, while ecstacy, which is a kind of speed, makes you end the songs much sooner?
Could be.)

<p>
And Lennon's <i>Imagine</i> is just classic.
Imagine no religion. Imagine nobody getting killed for Allah, or Jesus, or Buddha,
or whatever. Yes, imagine.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
I continue to receive sexual predatory stories on my blogs weekly, and am
still seeking people who are willing to share their stories. If you would
like to speak to me privately, please e-mail me at makeaasafer@gmail.com

<p>
*ABOUT THE FILM:*

<p>
The 13th Step is about the criminal and sexually predatory behavior that
occurs systemically in Alcoholics Anonymous. This behavior goes unchecked
by A.A's world headquarters, despite repeated warnings from respect board
members and longtime members. This behavior is exacerbated by the
systematic sentencing of criminals and sex offenders to AA meetings without
the knowledge of the AA members.

Hello again, Monica,
<p>

for the film.

<p>
Hiya Orange,

<p>
Heard a guy sponsee share at an AA meeting years ago... &quot;My home was broken into the
other night and electrical goods were stolen, my sponsor said to me 'Well, this
burglar must have needed the items more than you,' he made a fair point&quot;.

<p>
The abnormal sure becomes the normal in good ol' AA.

<p>
Keep up the good work.

Hello Mickey,
<p>
Thanks for the story. That is appalling, isn't it? The corn-pone fake spirituality of Steppism is
really something else.
<p>
If a girl gets raped, is she supposed to say, &quot;Well, I guess he needed sex more than I needed my virginity.&quot;
<p>
And if she gets AIDS from it, is she supposed to say, &quot;Well, I guess he needed to freely give what was freely
given to him. Pass it on.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	In response to you blog.<br>

<p>
Just had a read through your blog<br>
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_graduates" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_graduates</a>

<p>
You critic the philosophy &#8212; which you are entitled to do
However you fail to engage in the facts that when people follow the actions
outlined in the aa big book to the &quot;best of their abilities&quot;
They are able to; and are; leading sober, productive, happy, enlighten
lives.
<p>
The one glaring omission in your blog is Over 2 million people globally have
&quot;recovered&quot; from alcoholism

<p>
The cult you speak of;  has only one requirement for membership:- that is a
&quot;desire&quot; to stop drinking.

<p>
I will close with the following:-<br>
Whether attributed to Spencer; Poole or Pope makes no difference:-
There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof
against all argument, and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting
ignorance.
This principle is, contempt prior to examination.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tony,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Alas, you are just repeating A.A. mythology. There is no truth to those
statements. None whatsoever. A.A. does not make people sober. A.A. does not make people live
happy lives. That is a fairy tale, just the propaganda of a cult religion, just like
Scientology, which also brags that they sell meaningful happy lives to their victims.
<p>
I challenge you to show me any valid medical or clinical tests of A.A. that showed that A.A. produced
good results.

<p>
In fact, one of your own Trustees, who just loves A.A. and who promotes it every chance he gets,
tested A.A. for many years, trying to prove that it works, and he accidentally proved that A.A. kills.
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma found that A.A increased binge drinking</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found that A.A increased the rate of rearrests</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Walsh found that A.A increased the cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant, who went on to become an A.A. trustee, found that A.A. did not increase sobriety in alcoholics at all, not even a little bit, but it did raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.

<li>
So what's the actual A.A. cure rate?
The answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">here</a>.
</ol>

<p>
Also see
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html" target="_blank">Stories of sexual exploition in the Midtown Group of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>
<li> <a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy Imusland's Pacific Group</a>.
<p>
<li> And there are the people who get told not to take their medications, often with very bad results.
See their stories here:
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">A.A. &quot;No Meds&quot; Stories</a>.
<li> And then there are
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">the A.A. suicides</a>.
<li>  And
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">the A.A. divorce rate</a>.
<li> And you can finish with
 <a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. horror stories</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The simple undeniable fact is that A.A. does more harm than good.

<p>
Also, there are no &quot;two million saved&quot;. That is just another standard A.A. lie. A.A. does not even
have 2 million members in the whole world, and the vast majority of the membership is just visiting,
soon to get drunk and drop out.  All that A.A. really has is &quot;churn&quot;
&#8212; hundreds of thousands of people are shoved into A.A., and then hundreds of thousands of
people reject A.A. and leave. See the following for proof:
<ul>

The_Mathematics_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous_-_Part_1.pdf</a> &#8212; Analysis of the mathematics of Alcoholics Anonymous, using A.A.'s own published documents

<li>
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">A spreadsheet from the Foxhall Group in Omaha, Nebraska</a>,
that reveals the counts of newcomers and drop-outs.
</ul>

<p>
And actually, A.A. has many requirements for membership:
<ul>
<li> Do not criticize the program.
<li> Do not tell the historical truth about A.A. or Bill Wilson or Dr. Bob.
<li> Believe the nonsense that you are told.
<li> Believe that it isn't at all crazy to say that you are insane, but an invisible ghost is going
to fix your brain for you.
<li> Do not reveal the fact that the A.A. <i>Big Book</i> is the ravings of a couple of lunatics  &#8212;  in
particular, Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman and William Griffith Wilson.

<li> Do not admit that A.A. is an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties that was founded by
a minister
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">who attended Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and
<i>Sieg-Heil</i>-ed Adolf Hitler</a>.
<li> Do not say that
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">the A.A. program is heretical and anti-Christian</a>.
<li> Do not drink alcohol.
<li> Do not take your doctor-prescribed medications because they might mess with
&quot;your sobriety&quot; (but it's okay to smoke cigarettes).
<li> Do not tell the police about the sexual predators at your meetings.
<li> Do not talk about Jesus or Christianity in A.A. meetings. Only talk about &quot;My Higher Power&quot;.
<li> Do not complain about all of the contradictions and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch tricks</a> in &quot;The Program&quot;.
<li> Do not reveal the fact that A.A. doesn't work; and all that they are doing is stealing the
credit for a few cases of normal spontaneous remission. That is, from the people who were going to
quit drinking anyway.

</ul>

<p>
Lastly, I am well aware of this quote, because I also
<a href="menu1.html" target="_blank">begin my own web site with it</a>:

<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" width="95%">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">

The above famous misquote<font size="-1"><sup><a href="menu1.html#ftnt01" target="_blank">1</a></sup></font>
was put in the <i>Big Book</i> by William G. Wilson,
in Appendix II, &quot;Spiritual Experience&quot;,
in the back of the second and third editions.
Bill Wilson was trying to imply that we should not dismiss his
&quot;spiritual cure for alcoholism&quot; without first trying it.
<p>
That is curious, because in 1864 Herbert Spencer was actually arguing against
fundamentalist religious beliefs and dogmatic blind faith,
and in favor of Charles Darwin's new theory of evolution.

<p>
Nevertheless, that quote sounds like good advice.
So let's really, honestly, investigate Alcoholics Anonymous,
without rejecting criticism of A.A. before investigation of
all of the facts...

Beat the snake against the ground a few times to stun it, and then flip it around
so that the head is in the heron's mouth, ready for swallowing. When the heron
swallows the snake head-first, the snake's scales can't stick out and impede
the progress down the throat. That orientation also makes it nearly impossible
for the snake to crawl back out of the heron.
