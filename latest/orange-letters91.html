Aaaah. I just read what you wrote about rescuing the goslings. As Tennessee Ernie
Ford used to say, &quot;Bless your pea-pickin' heart!&quot; :-) I can't wait to hear more of the story on your website.
<p>
About a week ago I saw the parent geese in my complex.
Parading around with ALL SIX of their nearly full grown chicks.
I was so happy. That is a miracle, that all 6 lived to adult hood.
We have hawks, possums, raccoons and cats
around here. I noticed residents coming by and feeding them.
<p>
Well good luck with
your new family. I guess we'll have to rename you
&quot;Father Goose.&quot;? ;-)

<p>

Hey, I know you're probably really behind in mail but don't forget to check out the
one I sent you where in I discovered I was 'birthed' by Lois' brother and Bill's
brother in law. I sent that in the last week or so and I'm still
REELING from discovering that lil tidbit!

Hi again, Madame,
<p>
Yes, I was just getting to your other letter &#8212; taking them in chronological order. And
your delivery by Lois Wilson's brother is indeed quite a coincidence. What a small
world it is.

<p>
You're right about the dangers of those predators to the goslings and ducklings.
The momma ducks here have a terrible time of it.
Sometimes they lose all of their ducklings to feral cats and river rats. It's really heart-breaking to
see some momma with 9 or 12 tiny fluff-ball ducklings one day, and then 2 the next day, and then none the
next day. And I hear that racoons are bad this year too, and are taking their toll.
<p>
The Canada Geese are better at fighting them off, but the parents
still sometimes come out of those fights scarred for life.
<p>
About &quot;Father Goose.&quot; &#8212; a friend was wise-cracking that of all the experiences he
never believed he would have, he never imagined that he would actually meet &quot;Mother Goose&quot;
in real life. He also said that he
never would have guessed that &quot;Mother Goose&quot; would turn out to be a guy.

<p>
A few more pictures and your story follow.

<p>
And have another good day.

May 19, 2008, Day 2: The goslings get introduced to the city park nearby so that they can run around and
eat grass. They loved it and demanded to
come back to the park all of the time &#8212; like every day, 2 or 3 times a day, or even
better, just stay at the park all day long when the weather is good.
Fortunately, Portland doesn't use any poisons on the parks &#8212; no toxic bug sprays or herbicides
&#8212; protecting human children and all of that. It works for goslings too.
(A friend snapped this shot, so it is one of the few pictures
that shows me with the goslings.)

<p>
The goslings are great ice-breakers. Zillions of people stop by and ask what they are, and say hi.
Among the new friends who showed up the first day in the park were Sam (a woman) and Ka'ge (a guy),
who had raised a couple of broods of Canada Geese themselves, and released them back into Waterfront
Park. They gave me a bunch of helpful advice about how to raise them, including things that you would
never guess, like &quot;Don't give them any red peppers or Mexican food that contains chili peppers. Capsaicin
is poisonous to Canada Geese.&quot; Not that I was planning to feed the cute little fluff-balls
any chili peppers, but it's sure good to know about the danger. And, oddly enough, they like black pepper.

<br>
Also, &quot;Avoid rye bread. The geese are vulnerable to ergotamine poisoning, and there is a small chance that
some ergot fungus may have grown on the rye before it got made into bread.&quot; (You know, the ergot fungus that
is famous for growing LSD-25...)

Subject:  	Mdme Senga: I was slapped by Lois Wilson's brother!!!<br>

<p>

Hi AO,

<p>

OK I was slapped while naked and upside down... and minutes old but...

<p>

Is this a &quot;trip&quot; or what? I was looking at your website again, &#8212;
just 2 days ago, and
looking at *Bill Wilson and Lois Wilson's wills* and...there on Bill's was a
familiar name. I did a double take and my jaw dropped. Because it
was the same name as on my birth certificate. Bill Wilson's brother-in-law, Lois's
brother...DELIVERED
ME. He was my mother's obstetrician!! No shit!! (I'm from the NY/NJ ares so small
world but not so
impossible). From more investigating I'm pretty certain I'm correct. Dr Lyman
Burnham is mentioned with
his wife &quot;Florence&quot; on Bill's 1968 will. On Lois Wilson's 1983 will, there is no
mention of bequeathing to her
brother Lyman but she still mentions Florence. This coincides... I had reason to call
Dr Burnham's residence
looking for my natal and prenatal records sometime between 1981 and 1983 and I got
his wife and she? at
that time informed me he had passed away fairly recently, in the last year or two
years. (So that would make
sense, him not being on the drawn up 1983 will). I saved the envelope she sent the
records in and it had an
englewood NJ return address. I looked on line and a Dr Lyman Burnham did pass away
with residence listed
as Englewood NJ/ Bergen County(where I as born) &quot;possible spouse Florence Burnham&quot;.

<p>

Whats funny to me too, is, my mother hated him. And &#8212; I mean: hated him. &#8212; She did not
use him when she got pregnant again, after me. The only reason he, and his name,
even stuck in my mind is that my mother hated him that much! Left a very bad
impression on her, I only wish I could remember her few antedotal stories in the
brief time she dealt with him, but he was legendary in a monsterous way. (My sister
would ask &quot;Did we have the same
doctor?&quot; and I'd be like, &quot;No, you had the nice one,
mine was the mean one.&quot; And I
was saying that from at least
age 6 or 7 and up.) &#8212; Sullen, mean, ill-humored. My impression was of a man who had
little respect for his female patients and treated them less like human beings and
more like cattle. My mother said not one kind word about him, if my birth came up in
conversation. It was burned into my brain at a young age I was delivered by a jerk.
I seem to recall my mother observing other women leaving the waiting room as upset
as she often did. Bit of an SOB. (However, I'm pleased to see from the retrieved
records he was an SOB he did not get duped by the drug companies: wrote in the
margins how he would not use this or that pre-natal drug on my mother because it was
&quot;unproved&quot;/ not tested long enough--guess he was good in one respect).
Anyway,
trippy huh??

<p>

PS: of course I had to laugh at the Stepping Stone website saying Lois claimed to
come from an idyllic childhood.
I can't imagine me telling my mother that if she was still alive. I can tell you for
sure her response would be something like &quot;What kind of idyllic childhood produces a
man like that?&quot; No kidding.I can't stress enough how
little she thought of that man. Now all these years later his name leaps off your
website and slaps me in the face.
Small world.

<p>

Hey Orange,

<p>

You must have incredible patience to actually converse with all the steppers who
attack you and the truth.  I stopped reading your letter section some time ago for a
simple reason- the average 12 step person is incapable of forming an original
thought or idea.  They say the same things over and over.  It never ends.  They
reveal their inability to step outside of their narrow belief system and ponder
anything other than what they have been taught.  You know, the biggest proof of AA
being religious isn't the numerous court decisions deeming it as such, but rather
the reaction evoked when you question or criticize anything that they (steppers)
hold as an immutable truth.  They will often (almost always) resort to personal
attacks.  My experience shows this to be true even with those who have infiltrated
our health care system &#8212; the self proclaimed &quot;treatment providers&quot;.  How is it that a
person who suffers from the &quot;disease&quot; of addiction is only offered one form of
treatment?  What's happening today in these treatment centers is akin to a family
phyician prescribing only one medication, say penicillin and nothing else.  Of course
if the patient doesn't show any improvement well then he needs to take more
penicillin. If after a week he is still ill, well then it is obvious that he isn't
taking the medication as prescribed. It goes on and on.  It may sound silly but
that is exactly what is occuring today with alcoholics/addicts who seek treatment.

<p>

For myself I was lucky.  I finally realized that AA was causing me more harm than
good. Upon reflection it's easy for me to get angry with myself for buying into the
lies that perpetuate the notion that AA works.  I was duped...for years. UGH!!!!  I
wasted so much time attentatively  listening to these self righteous 12 step gurus
regurgitate an endless stream of hypocrisy and utter nonsense.  Like yourself I have
begun a process of pledging my time to warn others of the cult.  As you know, all
you have to do is tell the truth.  And the truth is that AA or NA isn't about
helping someone stay sober.  No, AA is about AA. It's primary purpose isn't to help
others but to recruit new members by indoctrination, deception, intimidation and
coercion. Is that too many &quot;tions&quot;?

<p>

Like Rational Recovery's founder Jack Trimpey I too hope to see the day that AA is
reliquinshed from our health care system and forced back to where it
belongs... church basements.

<p>

Take care and keep up the good work,

<p>

Chris

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Chris,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments, and thanks for the story. And congratulations on your escape.
And please do continue the campaign to get the word out.

<p>
What gives me the &quot;patience to actually converse with all the steppers who
attack you and the truth&quot; is that I have to remember to consider the source.
The people who are attacking me are sick, deluded people. Either physically sick, or
mentally sick, or both. And they have been indoctrinated and practically brain-washed
into a cultish belief system that pretends to have all of the answers to &quot;Life, the Universe,
and Everything&quot; (as Douglas Adams would put it), and they believe that anyone
who says something different is automatically wrong.  To some extent it may be their own
fault &#8212; to some extent they voluntarily bought into the system &#8212; but to a great extent they are more
victims than offenders.  They got recruited and indoctrinated at a time in their lives when
they were very sick, weak, and vulnerable &#8212; easy targets for any cult.
And now they are stuck.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Orange, I'm taking the liberty of responding to
<a href="orange-intro.html">your &quot;Introduction&quot; page</a>.  I've read
most of your site and even sent you an e-mail a while ago.  Your history is nice and
some of your points are very valid but you seem to have resentments galore.  You can
respond to me if you like and/or use this on your site but either way I wanted to
reach out with my opinions for what they're worth.

<p>

I've been sober since 1997 and have been very active in AA and have sponsered many
people.  Some of your complaints seem so common to me that it seems a shame you gave
up on the program before you fully understood it.  Belive me, it's not perfect and
it's not for everyone so but it's not the evil cult you claim.  Not by a long shot.

<p>

This is the best way I can think of to respond because you have so many arguments in
so many places, I figure if I go to the begining I can maybe answer some of you
question.
Maybe I'm wasting my time but for some reason, as I read your pages, you seem like a
good guy.
Like your really interested in sobriety, I mean.  And if AA isn't for you, then I
respect that but your just too heavy handed in your treatment of AA.  At least
compared to my experience.

Introduction<br>
by A. Orange<br>
These essays, which have ended up pretty much making up a whole book, began as my
attempt to clarify my own thinking about A.A., and to explain to others why I felt
that there was something wrong with people trying to shove Alcoholics Anonymous on
patients. I had signed up for a course of outpatient &quot;alcoholism treatment&quot;, but
ended up getting something more like &quot;Introduction to Cult Religion 101,&quot; where most
of the &quot;course of treatment&quot; consisted of compulsory attendance of Alcoholics
Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous 12-Step meetings, and &quot;group therapy&quot; sessions
where xeroxed copies of A.A. and N.A. literature was handed out and discussed by a
12-Step true-believer group leader, someone who just assumed that of course everyone
who recovers will do it at 12-Step meetings...
I started out with a very positive view of Alcoholics Anonymous. Like most people, I
had only heard good things about A.A., and thought that it was just a wonderful
self-help group where alcoholics got together to give each other moral support and
advice in quitting drinking.
I began to get the funny feeling that there was something wrong, that something
didn't quite add up right. For instance, in a &quot;group therapy&quot; session, I mentioned
the fact that a dozen years earlier, I had quit drinking, all on my own, and stayed
quit for over three years. The counselor declared that I had not had a period of
&quot;recovery,&quot; that I had only been &quot;abstaining,&quot; because &quot;I had not been dealing with
any issues.&quot; The counselor had not bothered to ask about my past, other than to ask
how many A.A. meetings I had gone to before (only 4, ever), so he had no way of
knowing whether I had dealt with any &quot;issues.&quot; He simply assumed that I had not, and
declared that I had not. He was wrong, totally wrong. You don't just quit and stay
quit for three years without dealing with all of the issues, problems, and hassles
of real life. Nobody gets a free 3-year vacation from all of their problems just by
abstaining from both beer and A.A. meetings. (Heck, that would be a great recovery
program if you could do that...) Then, when I wanted to debate that point, he
changed the subject and wouldn't discuss it.
</font></font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>

Okay, so you stayed sober for 3 years (I did it only for 1 year myself) and then you
went back to drinking, right ?  And you ended up in group therapy, right ?<br>
So, do you still think the counselor was that far off base ?<br>
If you dealt with all the issuses would you have picked up after 3 years ?<br>
It's your story, your call.  You have a point, to get any run of sobriety you have
to be doing something right, but do you think you addressed the core issues now that
you can look back on it ?  And if you did , why did you drink again ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tony,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Yes, actually I did eventually deal with all of my issues. The biggest mistake that I
made after three years of sobriety was starting to think that I wasn't really an
alcoholic, because it had been so easy to stay sober for three years. I thought that the
&quot;real alcoholics&quot; &#8212; especially the ones portrayed in A.A.-promoting movies &#8212;
are constantly craving a drink and having
to call their sponsors in the middle of the night, crying that they are afraid that they are about to
take a drink. I did none of that, so I mistakenly thought that I had alcohol under control
now. But that was a tragically wrong belief. Just a few beers very quickly turned into heavy
drinking for years. Live and learn.  That is just another example of how A.A. stereotypes and
misinformation hurt people.

</font>
<p>

Also, he wouldn't debate with you.<br>
Why should he ?<br>
You came to him for help and the only way he can help you is if you listen to him.
He's the counselor and your the patient.  Not very easy on the ego to a newly sober
drunk, but true nonetheless.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ego? You think my reluctance to hand control of my mind and my life over to a cocaine-snorting
child molester is my ego getting in the way? That is so wrong and illogical that it is downright
Looney-Tunes. But that is the usual Alcoholics Anonymous attitude.
<i>&quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth.&quot;</i>
<p>
Well, blind obedience to authority is not a good approach to life in either a treatment center or
in the real world. When you are dealing with a bunch of ex-addicts (and relapsed addicts), ex-convicts,
and assorted other criminals and perverts, it is wise to keep your eyes open and see clearly.
And don't believe everything you are told.

<p>
You are demonstrating how the A.A. cult puts
people down as a way of weakening them, and then tries to take their independence away from
them while they are weakened.
If anybody shows any signs of independent thinking, then just start harping on how stupid they were to
have drunk so much alcohol...  And they should just shut up and listen and obey.
(By the way, <a href="orange-rroot390.html#CD_poster">&quot;Listen and Obey&quot; is pure Buchmanism</a>.)
<p>
And the commandment to &quot;abandon ego&quot; is
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_obliterate_self">just another standard cult characteristic</a>.
<p>
<a name="spill_off"> </a>
Do you actually think for one minute that I would have been better off if I had believed the
dogmatic slogan-slinging of that criminal pervert?<br>
(Ummm, you did read the bottom of the introduction page, didn't you? Like
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">where it describes</a>
how my so-called &quot;counselor&quot; was arrested and imprisoned for
two counts of criminal sexual penetration of minors, and multiple instances
of possession of cocaine, and child pornography?
He was really a great spiritual sobriety teacher, wasn't he?)
<p>
By not following that &quot;counselor's&quot; advice, I now have 7 1/2 years off of both alcohol and tobacco.
When I quit smoking, 3 weeks after I quit drinking, he actually advised against it by saying,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Don't put too much on your plate or something might spill off.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I sure am glad I didn't listen to him. And my lungs are happy about it too. So is my general health.

<p>
By the way, I wasn't &quot;the patient&quot;. They were very clear about that.
We were &quot;clients&quot;, not &quot;patients&quot;.
We couldn't be patients because the treatment center had no healing credentials. They would not even give me
aspirin for a headache because, they explained, they had zero medical credentials and were not
qualified to give out aspirin. Funny that they considered themselves qualified to give out advice
and pontifications on the life-or-death issues of alcoholism and drug addiction...

<p>
Oh, and I didn't &quot;go to him for help&quot;, either. I agreed to go through the treatment program in
trade for housing in a shelter, so that I wouldn't have to sleep in the rain.
I approached the program optimistically,
hoping to maybe learn something useful from it. Little did I know that I was
going to get an education about something else instead,
like the sorry state of &quot;drug and alcohol treatment&quot; in the USA.
<p>
Lastly, you are overlooking the fact that Alcoholics Anonymous has no quality control for
sponsors. Any pervert or criminal can claim to be an expert on addiction just by declaring that
he has a few years of sobriety. He doesn't even need to be clean and sober. He can lie about it
and just claim to be sober,
and he is still fully qualified to be an A.A. sponsor.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links9">He can even be there at the meetings
solely to seduce under-age girls</a>,
and he is still a qualified A.A. sponsor. There is no examination to be an A.A. sponsor;
there is no Board of Ethics; there are no rules or regulations; there is nobody to answer to,
and there are no check-ups. Being an A.A. sponsor or a &quot;drug and
alcohol counselor&quot; is a great haven
for all kinds of criminals, perverts, and psychos.</font>

Only later did I learn that such behavior is typical of properly-indoctrinated A.A.
true believers. They will always declare that you are not &quot;in recovery&quot; if you are
not attending their Twelve-Step meetings and doing their Twelve Steps. You are &quot;only
abstaining&quot; from drinking alcohol, or &quot;only dry&quot;, but not &quot;sober&quot;.
That may seem like a minor point, but when you are fighting for your life, you don't
want to find out, half-way through the treatment program, that the counselor is an
irrational religious fanatic with his own agenda. That feels like being in a jet
airliner, cruising at 40,000 feet, and suddenly discovering that the pilots are
drunk and crazy, and that you are on your own when it comes to safely flying that
airplane.

<p>
I think it is a minor point.  It's also a matter of opinion and not AA in any strict
sense.<br>
But your complaining because you've asked for help and you don't like the help
that's being offered.<br>
AA describes itself as Spiritual.  It does this very plainly in the Big Book and
12/12.<br>
You don't like this.  That's fair enough.  Maybe AA really isn't for you.  But maybe
your counselor was happy with it.  Why can't he live a spiritual life if he wants
too ?<br>
Did he try and force his beliefs on you ?<br>
Or did he tell you your free to choose your own higher power and leave it at that ?<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are missing the major point that a dogmatic religious nutcase was
 promoting &quot;12-Step Spirituality&quot; when he was supposed to be
 giving &quot;treatment for alcoholism&quot;. He was getting paid by the
 city, state, and Federal Government to &quot;treat alcoholics and addicts&quot;.
And his &quot;spirituality&quot; amounted
to going home and snorting cocaine and screwing his step-children.
<p>
And the fact that A.A. describes itself as &quot;spiritual&quot; is both
irrelevant and hypocritical. Anybody or anything can claim to be spiritual.
All of these organizations also described themselves as &quot;spiritual&quot;:
<ul>
<li> Rev. Jim Jones's <i>People's Temple</i>
<li> David Koresh's <i>Branch Davidians</i>
<li> Marshall Herff Applewhite's <i>Heaven's Gate</i>

woman there advised me to eat lots of ice cream to soothe my extremely painful
stomach cramps, and to drink lots and lots of orange juice to help restore my
electrolyte balance. Now, when I repeated that advice in &quot;group therapy&quot;, the

was reading Jack Trimpey's &quot;The Small Book&quot;.      &quot;What?! Isn't that the one without
the Higher Power?!&quot;Then he told us that Rational Recovery's AVRT technique
(Addictive Voice Recognition Therapy) is just so complex and difficult that you will
die before you figure it out, so don't mess with it.
Not! AVRT is actually just a process of recognizing the thoughts that are the voice
of the Addiction Monster, aka the Beast (the base brain, really), as it tempts you
to take a drink. It is pathetically easy, once you get the hang of it. It is just
like those Walt Disney cartoons with Donald Duck having a little devil on one
shoulder, and a little angel on the other, and the little devil is whispering into
Donald's ear, &quot;Smoke! Drink! It will be fun!&quot;
Children can understand that cartoon, but my A.A.-indoctrinated counselor said that
recognizing that situation as it is happening is much too difficult for you or I (or
him) to do, so Rational Recovery is confusing people into drinking themselves to

I continued going to A.A. and N.A. meetings, and continued to overlook the goofy
stuff. Some people were obviously pretty far out there on the religious angle. I
thought that was a bit much &#8212; I'm not into public displays of religiosity &#8212; but I
could live with it, because I'm not an agnostic or an atheist. When people were
saying things that were obviously crazy, I just thought, &quot;Well, whatever. If
believing that stuff helps them to keep from drinking, then okay, any port in a
storm.&quot;
<p>
Then, a friend remarked that some people had accused A.A. of being a cult. That got
me to thinking. Then I stumbled across Charles Bufe's book, Alcoholics Anonymous,
Cult or Cure?, in the public library, and that was it. The dam burst, and a giant
wall of water swept across the landscape.
So I read a lot of books and articles, both pro and con, and did a good bit of
investigating, as well as attending a whole lot of those mandatory Twelve-Step
meetings, both Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.
<p>
I came to the conclusion that Alcoholics Anonymous is really just a cult religion,
one that passes off its proselytizing under the guise of alcoholism treatment, in
just the same way as the Church of Scientology sells its cultish psycho-babble and
techno-babble nonsense as self-improving psychotherapy. And Narcotics Anonymous is
just another clone of A.A.. And so are all of the other 12-Step &quot;self-help groups.&quot;

<p>

Now your over the line.  Complaining about your rehabs and AA is one thing, but
comparing it to Scientology or even the Oxford group is too much of a stretch.<br>
And you'll start attacking Bill Wilson on a personal level in the next paragraph.<br>
This is where your thinking gets dangerous.<br>
You don't like your midicine so no one else should take theirs.<br>
No room for individual choice in your argument.  AA is bad and must go and Bill
Wilson's reputation must be smeared.

<p>
<font color="blue">

You really are in denial, aren't you? The Oxford Group was the parent
 of Alcoholics Anonymous, and even the official A.A. publications declare
 it, and you complain that I am &quot;over the line&quot; when I tell
 the truth about that?  Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.
<p>
Even Bill Wilson himself declared that he got the A.A. theology and the
 guts of the 12 Steps from the Oxford Group:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,NewCentury Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Language of the Heart</i>, William G. Wilson, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,NewCentury Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of self-examination,
acknowledgement of character defects, restitution for
harm done, and working with others straight from the
Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 39.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson was being a little dishonest there, when he implied that
Sam Shoemaker was the leader of the Oxford Group. Frank Buchman was
the real leader, and he is the one who copied or made up
all of the theology and tenets and practices of the Oxford Group, which
Bill rewrote into the Twelve Steps. But Frank Buchman had a very bad
reputation for his praise of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi sympathizing,
so Bill Wilson listed Sam Shoemaker as the leader of the USA branch of
the Oxford Group.  But the theology and practices are all still pure
Buchmanism.
<p>
If you have been in A.A. for 11 years, then you have probably seen the
Hallmark made-for-TV movie, &quot;My Name is Bill W.&quot; at least
once. William Borchert's screenplay tells a completely untrue version
of the beginnings of A.A., showing Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob going around
Akron Ohio in the spring and summer of 1935 recruiting alcoholics for
their new sobriety organization. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Bill and Bob were recruiting alcoholics for the Oxford Group in Akron,
and they were using the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#five_C">standard Oxford Group cult recruiting practices like the
&quot;Five C's&quot;</a>. (Bill Wilson repeated the gist of those practices in Chapter 7 of the Big Book
as
<a href="orange-recruit.html">the instructions for how to recruit more A.A. members</a>.)
Then Dr. Bob would demand that the newly-sober alcoholics
get down on their knees and &quot;surrender to God&quot;, and then the
 new recruits would be taken to
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender2Bob1">an Oxford Group meeting at
 the large Westfield home of T. Henry and Clarace Williams</a>.
Bill and Dr. Bob wouldn't break off the alcoholic branch of the Oxford
 Group and make it into their own cult for years &#8212; 2 years in
 New York city, and 4 years in Akron.
<p>
In the mean time,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg">Frank Buchman went to Germany
 and attended Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies</a> and <i>Sieg Heil!</i>ed
 Hitler with the rest of the Nazis, and then had lunch with Heinrich Himmler,
 repeatedly. And then Buchman went to the 1936 Berlin Olympics as a guest
 of Heinrich Himmler, where Buchman declared Himmler to be a wonderful fellow,
and then Buchman came back to New York and praised Hitler and
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_interview">thanked Heaven for giving
 us a man like Adolf Hitler</a>,
and advocated <i>Christian Fascist Dictatorships</i> as a cure for all
 of the world's problems, and neither Bill Wilson nor Dr. Robert Smith
 quit the Oxford Group in protest.  They just kept right on recruiting
 alcoholics for the Oxford Group and claiming that they had a wonderful
 new cure for alcoholism.

<p>
&quot;Over the line&quot; for comparing Alcoholics Anonymous to the
 Oxford Group? I don't think so. It's not much different from comparing
 a guy to his father.

<p>
And the comparison to Scientology is valid too. The only huge glaring
 difference between A.A. and Scientology is that Scientology is blatantly
 out to steal all of your money and A.A. isn't.
Otherwise, they share an immense number of cult practices and they both
 sell quackery as a cure-all. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html">the Cult Test</a>.<br>
(And the treatment centers that sell A.A. as a cure for alcoholism
will take your money, instead. And since more than 90% of the
&quot;counselors&quot; at TCs are 12-Step members, they will get the
money indirectly.)

<p>
And I do not &quot;smear Bill Wilson's reputation&quot;. I tell the
historical truth about what kind of a lying con man he was, and how he
took a part of Frank Buchman's cult and made it his own so that he never
 had to work again.
Bill Wilson became very wealthy by selling Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion as a cure for alcoholism.

If there is one sentence that sums up my feelings about Bill Wilson's teachings
most, a feeling that keeps popping up when I examine the stupid and insane things
that Bill Wilson wrote, it is this sentence from one of the essays:

<p>
&quot;This is just so typical of Bill's insanity: everything he says almost rings true,
it almost has some truth in it, you can see what he is getting at and almost agree
with it, but there is just something a little bit off about all of it.&quot;
For example, Bill Wilson talks at length about the need to be freed from ego, the
need to be freed from &quot;the bondage of self.&quot; Now, liberation from ego is a great
thing, if the student can accomplish it. It is a magnificent spiritual
accomplishment, the culmination of a lifetime of training and preparation. Many
spiritual schools teach techniques for doing it, like the Sufis, Zen Buddhists, and
various yogis and swamis.

everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kills

A.A. assures the students that they will get good results from working the program,
if they are willing to go to any length to get sobriety, and if they really try, but
the truth is that they almost invariably will not get the promised results. A.A. has
a failure rate that ranges from 95% to 100%. One of the most enthusiastic boosters
of Alcoholics Anonymous is Professor George E. Vaillant of Harvard University, who
is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services,
Inc., which means that he is one of the leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous. Well,
Professor Vaillant showed by his own 8-year-long test of A.A.-based treatment
programs that A.A. was worse than useless: it didn't help the alcoholics any more
than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program
tested &#8212; leaving nearly one-third of the patients dead. While trying to prove that
Alcoholics Anonymous treatment works, Vaillant succeeded in proving that A.A. kills.

attendance makes people quit drinking.

People who are willing to go to any length do tend to get sober and eventually stay
sober.  Most people aren't willing to do that at any given time.  So, maybe your 5%
rate is true.  I don't know.  Could be 5, could be 25.  I know the odds are against
the alchoholic.  You seem to blame this on AA though.  The culpert is alcoholism,
not AA.  When a person dies of cancer, do  you blame the doctor ?  That's an
emotional and immature position.  Common enough, but not really very helpfull.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, your approach is wrong. You are trying to shift the blame for failure from A.A. to the individual
alcoholics. That is the standard A.A. dodge. What you are really saying is that A.A. is ineffective
and does not work. Only the alcoholics getting their own lives together and quitting drinking
works. And if a successful newly-sober alcoholic happens to be in or near an A.A. meeting when he
quits and stays quit, then A.A. will take the credit for the success story.
But A.A. always shoves the blame for the failures back onto the alcoholics themselves.

Now personally, I also believe that it's up to the individual alcoholics to save themselves. They will decide to
live or die. They will either quit drinking or they won't. Alcoholics Anonymous is totally irrelevant
and ineffective, and is just a cult that steals the credit from others.
<p>
About the claim that <i>&quot;People who are willing to go to any length do tend to get sober and eventually stay
sober&quot;</i>: Well yes, but that has nothing to do with A.A., now does it?
A.A. apologists routinely use that line to try to limit A.A.'s scope of responsibility to only the successful
people.  That's the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational">Cherry Picking</a>&quot;.
I can just as easily claim that playing tiddly-winks works great as a program of sobriety for those few people
who really sincerely want to quit drinking and who are willing to go to any length to get sober,
and who will really <i>Work A Strong Program</i>.

I think the thing that really gets to me the most, the thing that angers me the
most, is how almost everybody connected with the drug and alcohol treatment industry
just assumes that the whole 12-Step program works great, and is the answer to
everything, and really does help lots of people. The so-called &quot;counselors&quot; are
nothing but disguised cult recruiters who shove their 12-Step religion on everybody
they can, and they simply assume that if you are recovering from drug or alcohol
problems, then you will of course become a happily-converted member of their 12-Step
religion that they won't admit is a religion. And they have the gall to charge your
health insurance for their religious proselytizing.

<p>
Umm, rehabs aren't AA.  AA doesn't get money from any health insurance company.
Not fair.  Rehabs use alot of 12 step stuff but your tend to lump AA and rehab and
group therapy together.  You take the worst of everything and call it AA.
Not fair.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes fair. The so-called &quot;Rehab Centers&quot; are just recruiting
centers for Alcoholics Anonymous.  The staffers are mostly 12-Steppers
(doing their 12th-Step work), and the standard answer for all alcoholics
is to route them into A.A. meetings. In fact, the majority of the
&quot;treatment&quot; is just meetings &#8212; some &quot;group therapy&quot;
meetings where people are guided to talk about drinking alcohol, and
then the clients are told to go to &quot;at least three A.A. meetings per week,
or preferably one every day.&quot;
And that is all that the &quot;treatment program&quot; amounts to.
They are really just selling A.A. meetings.

And that is pretty much all of the &quot;help&quot; that people in &quot;recovery&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot;
programs get. The treatment programs which are based on the Twelve-Step religion and
are run by the Twelve-Step true believers &#8212; which means about 93% of all of the
drug and alcohol treatment programs in the U.S.A. &#8212; do little more than xerox off
Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous training (indoctrination) materials and
read it to people in &quot;group therapy&quot; sessions, and then send the people to three or
more A.A. or N.A. meetings per week (maybe even 90 meetings in 90 days for rapid
indoctrination). That unethical behavior is being financed with the public's tax
money and health insurance money. And that is a crime.
One young woman whom I couldn't help but like had accumulated 9 months off of
alcohol when she relapsed. Her true-believer building manager (where she was housed,
in a program,) sentenced her to 90 meetings in 90 days for relapsing. When she cried
at a meeting that she was so tired of getting sucked back into drinking, and ending
up waking up with strange guys, but she was having a problem with &quot;giving herself
completely&quot; to the 12-Step program, one of the resident true believers announced
that the answer to all such problems is
&quot;Do The Twelve Steps, Get A Sponsor, and Read The Big Book.&quot;
Well, it didn't work. She relapsed repeatedly, and they kicked her out of the program.
The last time I saw her, she was drunk on the streets, and fishing for a guy to buy
her drinks. Since she is young, tall, slim, and very pretty, she has no problem
getting some guy to buy her an unlimited stream of drinks (in trade, he hopes, for
getting her into bed). If she continues on that path, it's only a matter of time
before she gets AIDS and dies. What a tragic waste.

So, a girl went was having trouble relapsing and wouldn't take anyones advice.<br>
She ended up on the street.  And it's AA's fault, how ?<br>
Sorry but I'm not following you.  Yeah, addiction is brutal.  Yeah, it's a tragedy.<br>
But did the people in AA tell her to drink or to go to meetings, get active, read
the Big Book and not drink no matter what ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
That was just the first of many such failures that I saw, where A.A. and N.A. showed themselves
to be useless and no help.
</font>
<p>

She had a problem giving herself to the 12 step program, but not to the bottle.
That's the way it is, that's why we need a program of recovery, that's why we're
insane !!!!!

You may be insane, but I'm not.

You are again spouting the standard cult dogma:
<ul>

I just can't help but think that there must be some better way to handle such
problems than a method that is obviously not working, the currently-used 12-Step
program. I can't help but think that a lot of people might be better off if they got
some other treatment or therapy besides cult religion and voodoo medicine.
So here are some essays on the subject. Enjoy.

Excellent, excellent website!

<p>

Awesome articles. Well-written and informative.

<p>

As a psychologist, I love the emphasis you place on the 'cultish' aspects of AA and
its herd mentality. I especially like your rational examination of the dogma, and
uncovering the 'religious' features of AA that have long been denied.

<p>

As a recovering alcoholic, I noticed that you touch on the weakest aspects and
glaring contradictions that constitute the rigid AA mindset. Much of what I already
suspected has now been put into words on your website.

<p>

Congrats!
