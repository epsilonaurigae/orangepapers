Orange, Your work is simply the most outstanding on the myth of AA ever written.
Your research and it's depth and foot notes to back it up are outstanding.
You must have spent years studying all of your work to have been so through in
getting the dirt on Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob, now it does seem to me that Dr.
Bob seems to have kept him self from getting as dirty as Bill Wilson did, but
one is judged by the company one keeps, and there is lots of room for Dr. Bob to
be scutinized too. I refer people to your web site when they are fed up with AA
meetings. I have visited your web site many times and I always find
something new that I didn't know before about AA and the damage it does to it's
adherants. Keep up the good work, some day perhaps AA will at long last be
debunked once and for all along with the entire &quot;treatment&quot; industry, and that
alone will a great reward for your efforts to expose the truth. The government
grants for the &quot;treatment industry&quot; should be cut off and the useless war on
drugs ended.
<p> 
Sincerely,<br>
Eric
<p>

<font color="blue">
Hi Eric,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. You're laying it on so heavy that I'm in danger of
getting a fat ego and having to go to an A.A. meeting to &quot;get my ego deflated&quot;.
<p>
(Just kidding.)
<p>

And yes, it actually has been two years now that I've been working on this.
<p>
And Doctor Bob really is an interesting case, isn't he? He generally has the reputation
for being the wise, reserved one who sort of kept Bill Wilson from going off on
tangents. But another picture of Doctor Bob is emerging, too &#8212; that of a dogmatic,
autocratic petty tyrant &#8212; a fool who grovelled before his wife as she searched his
pockets to see if he was sneaking booze into the house, but who was a harsh tyrant to
his children.
<p>
The most damning information about Doctor Bob comes from his own daughter,
Sue Smith, who described in her book <i>Children of the Healer</i>
how he forced on her the older man Ernie Galbraith, A.A. Number Four,
the author of the
<i>Big Book</i> first edition story, <i>The Seven-Month Slip</i>.
Sue was in love with her high-school sweet-heart Ray Windows, but Ray was only
a janitor, so Doctor Bob didn't like him. So Doctor Bob used Ernie Galbraith to
break up Sue and Ray.
<p>
But Ernie Galbraith turned out
to be a constantly-relapsing philanderer. A.A. didn't sober him up at all, or make
him holy.
Doctor Bob should have gotten
a huge hint about Ernie's character from reading Ernie's autobiographical
<i>Big Book</i> story &#8212;
the seven-month 'slip' was <i>seven months long</i>,
not just some little lapse after seven months of sobriety.
But no, Doctor Bob couldn't see it.
<p>
Ernie's story was removed from the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, but it took Sue many more years
to get divorced from Ernie. Then she finally married Ray.
What a heart-breaking story. Alcoholics Anonymous was a personal disaster for
Sue Smith, and did nothing for her but get her married to a repulsive old alcoholic
for 20 years.

<p>
Oh well, thanks for writing. Have a good day.
<p>

<p>
Sir,
<p>
I have just come across your website by accident, and discovered
your lamentable critique of Alcoholics Anonymous; a diatribe with all the
intellectual rigour of a Mickey Mouse cartoon.
<br>
You have the absolute gall to open your 'menu' page with the famous quote
from Spencer, then completely ignore it, and treat it as though it were
actually supporting your 'case.'
<br>
It does not.
<br>
With that one single solitary 'Sin of Ommission' you have completely shot
yourself in the foot.
<br>
Your Contempt, Sir, not only prior to, but during, and evidently, after,
too! - is utterly transparent. Your cynicism belongs to you, and you alone.
<br>
You are not an Alcoholic, are you?
<br>
There is a perfectly simple, and very blunt answer to all the hundreds of
pages you have so assiduously written to no avail whatsoever.
<br>
Nobody has the answer to Alcoholism. (or Addiction. Period.)
<br>
Nobody.
<br>
Alcoholics Anonymous has never claimed to have the answer. Does not claim
so. Will never claim so.
<br>
You completely miss the point. Alcoholics Anonymous has changed, and
improved the quality of my life beyond my wildest dreams.
<br>
The attempts of anybody to belittle it, or to denigrate it, are absolutely
laughable.
<p>
yours sincerely<br>
Ken H.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ken,<br>
That's quite a letter. I can almost hear a stuffy, haughty, British upper-class accent
in it, just from reading it.
(Or maybe I've just been watching too much Public Television lately.)

<p>
Your letter is a good example of the debating technique called
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#personal">ad hominem</a>&quot;</i> &#8212;
attack the speaker, rather than refuting his statements.
You accuse me of all kinds of things,
but you never actually offer any facts to back up your statements, or to disprove
my statements.
<p>
You are unhappy that I quote Spencer. You somehow feel that it is inappropriate
for me to quote one of the eminent defenders of Darwin's Theory of Evolution &#8212;
a man who argued for science with facts and logic &#8212; a man who argued against
blind faith and dogmatic religion.
<p>
You complain:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
You have the absolute gall to open your 'menu' page with the famous

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What Spencer wrote was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;There is a principle which is a bar against all information,
which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man
in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to
investigation.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
HERBERT SPENCER, <i>Principles of Biology</i>, London, 1864.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
And what I actually wrote was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The above famous quote was put in the <i>Big Book</i>
by William G. Wilson,
in Appendix II, &quot;Spiritual Experience&quot;,
in the back of the second and third editions.
Bill Wilson was trying to imply that we should not dismiss his
&quot;spiritual cure for alcoholism&quot; without trying it.
<p>
That is curious because Herbert Spencer was actually a social Darwinist
whose
attitude towards alcoholics was something like, &quot;Let them all
die. Getting rid of such inferior people will just help to
clean out the gene pool.&quot;
And Herbert Spencer was actually arguing against religious
beliefs, and in favor of Charles Darwin's new theory of evolution,
in 1864.
<p>
Nevertheless, that quote sounds like good advice.
So let's really, honestly, investigate Alcoholics Anonymous,
without rejecting criticism of A.A. before investigation of
all of the facts...
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I did not claim that Spencer supported my case. I said that Spencer's
suggestion &#8212; investigate the facts before jumping to conclusions
&#8212; sounded like good advice.<br>
(Please learn to read English, since you are English.)
<p>

Then I devote the whole rest of my web site to
gathering and investigating the actual facts, like
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
the real cult religion history of A.A. and the 12 steps</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">
the lunacy of A.A. founder Bill Wilson</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-heresy.html">
the insanity and religious heresy of the A.A. dogma</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
the failure of A.A. &quot;treatment&quot; to cure or improve alcoholism</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html">
the gross dishonesty of the Alcoholics Anonymous program and organization</a>,
<li> and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html">
the cult religion basis of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
</ul>

If you had bothered to read <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>,
you would also know that I actually started off with
a very positive idea of Alcoholics Anonymous, back in the days when I knew
very little about it.
Like everyone else, I had been fooled by the Alcoholics Anonymous publicity machine,
and thought that A.A. was just the biggest and best self-help organization in the country.
But my feelings about A.A. gradually grew more and more negative as I learned more
of the truth about it. It was only by investigation of the facts, both by going
to a lot of meetings, and by reading a lot of books, that I learned the truth.

<p>
If you have any real facts to offer, I'd love to see them.
I am always interested in more facts. I am interested in the truth, above all.
So please send your facts.
And any supporting documentation that you have will also be most welcome.
<p>
But please, send real facts, not hearsay, rumors, or anecdotal stories.
Hand-picked stories about a few poster children,
like Bill Wilson put in the <i>Big Book</i>, prove nothing.
(Wilson always left out all of the stories of A.A. failures.)
The best information
is scientifically-conducted tests with controls. Carefully-done surveys can
also be informative.

<p>
I'd especially like to see the results of the British tests of Alcoholics Anonymous.
(I hear that they showed that A.A. didn't work at all.) Have you heard about them?
Have you read the report?<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
[Later: Found it; <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">listed it here</a>.]
</font>

<p>
<a name="real_alcoholic"> </a>
You imply that I am not really an alcoholic. Brother, how I wish that accusation
were true. (I wasted so many years and blew so many opportunities.)
Everybody who knows me agrees that I'm an alcoholic.
My ex-wife says that I am one.
My <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">A.A.-indoctrinated counselor</a> said
that I was an alcoholic.
My doctor says that I'm one.
My doctor said, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Your choice.&quot;
My doctor even said that I was a &quot;late-stage alcoholic&quot;,
and said that the death rate for them was the same as for cancer &#8212; 50%.
<p>

The only people who say that I'm
not really an alcoholic are a few A.A. people who can't stand the idea that I have
successfully, happily quit drinking without A.A. or the Twelve Steps.
They always want to say,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, <i>*real*</i> alcoholics can't quit without A.A. and doing the
Twelve Steps, so you aren't really an alcoholic, are you?&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Well, yes I am, unfortunately.
<p>

You say that Alcoholics Anonymous does not have the answer to alcoholism.
Now there I agree with you, totally.<br>
<p>
But then you also say,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has never claimed to have the answer.
Does not claim so. Will never claim so.&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
Sorry, but you are wrong. You must be completely ignorant of the whole history
of Alcoholics Anonymous, and you also haven't bothered to read either the <i>Big Book</i>
of Alcoholics Anonymous, or my web pages, either.
<p>
<a name="recovered"> </a>
Bill Wilson always claimed that A.A. did have the answer,
and he even said that A.A. <i>*was THE answer*</i>.
<p>
Just to make sure that I wasn't imagining things, I grabbed one of my copies
of the <i>Big Book</i>, and turned to the very first page &#8212; the very first paragraph &#8212; of the
foreword to the first edition, and read:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We, of Alcoholics Anonymous, are more than one hundred men and women who have
recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body. To show other alcoholics
<i>precisely how we have recovered</i> is the main purpose of this book.
For them, we hope these pages will prove so convincing that no further authentication
will be necessary. We think this account of our experiences will help everyone
to better understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic is
a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living has its
advantages for all.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Foreword to the First Edition, William G. Wilson,
page xiii of the 3rd edition.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

<a name="prospectus"> </a>
So not only did Bill Wilson claim to have a working cure for alcoholism that had already
cured over 100 alcoholics, he also claimed that he had a &quot;spiritual&quot; way of
life that would be good for everybody else too.
And Wilson also claimed that the <i>Big Book</i> was a precise manual that told exactly how
to recover from alcoholism. That is claiming to have the answer.
<p>
And even before that, in
<a href="orange-prospectus.html">the Prospectus for the stock offering for the 100 Men Corporation</a>, which
raised the money to finance the writing and printing of the <i>Big Book</i>, Wilson wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Being convinced there was no other way out, the new man would look with more
favor and willingness upon a spiritual method in spite of any prejudice he
might have had.
<p>
In the spring of 1935 Mr. Wilson went to Akron, Ohio, on
business. While there he communicated his ideas to three other alcoholics.
Leaving the three men, he returned to New York in the fall of 1935, continuing
his activities there. These early seeds are now bearing amazing fruit. The
original Akron three have expanded themselves into more than seventy.
Scattered about New York and in the seaboard states there are about forty. Men
have even come out of insane asylums and resumed their community and family
lives. Business and professional people have regained their standing.
<p>
In all, about two-hundred cases of hopeless alcoholism have been dealt with.
As will be seen, about fifty percent of these have recovered. This, of course,
is unprecedented &#8212; never has such a thing happened before.
<p>
This work has claimed the attention of prominent doctors and institutions who
say without hesitation that in a few years time, as it gains impetous,
thousands of hitherto incurable cases may recover. Such people as the chief
physician of Charles B. Towns Hospital and psychiatrists of the Johns Hopkins
Hospital at Baltimore express such opinions.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><b>The One Hundred Men Corporation Prospectus</b>, December 1938,
page 4.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, Bill Wilson claimed to have a great new cure for alcoholism, one which
had already made many &quot;hopeless&quot; alcoholics recover &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;never has such a thing happened before&quot;</font> &#8212; and one which
he said some doctors believed promised to liberate great numbers of
alcoholics from hospitals and sanitariums.
Wilson even claimed a very high success rate for his &quot;spiritual&quot;
treatment program &#8212; he said that 50% of the alcoholics recovered.
(Unfortunately,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">Bill's claims were fraudulent</a>.)

<p>
Also note that Wilson used the word &quot;recovered&quot; &#8212; past tense &#8212;
in both of those quotes. He didn't say that alcoholics would never fully recover,
or that there was no answer for alcoholism, or no cure, or that alcoholics had to
stay <i>in recovery</i> for life.
Wilson said that they <i><b>had recovered</b></i> as a result of his new &quot;spiritual&quot;
treatment.
<p>

Only later did he change his story to<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve...&quot;<br>
</font>
--The <i>Big Book</i>, page 85.<br>
(Wilson had good reason to change his rap &#8212;
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100">his New York A.A.
group had a terrible relapse rate</a>...)

<p>
<a name="the_only_answer"> </a>

Wilson continued to claim that A.A. was the answer &#8212; even <i>the
only answer</i> for alcoholism &#8212;
in both the <i>Big Book</i> and in his second book, <i>Twelve Steps
and Twelve Traditions</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Some of them may sink and perhaps never get up, but if our
experience is a criterion, more than half of those
approached will become fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.</font><br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 163.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that there is no third choice: either sink or join A.A..<br>
Recovery without A.A. is not considered possible.
<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> and 12x12 also say:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...he was insisting that he had found the only cure.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 257.</font>
<p>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...they had found the only remedy...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 259.</font>

<p>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Any willing newcomer feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the
foundering vessel he has become.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 35.</font>
<p>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles
would solve all my problems.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, page 42.)
</font>
<p>

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it. &nbsp; ...<br>
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And above all:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested
<font color="#BF0000">[my required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to <font color="#BF0000">[my]</font>
spiritual principles.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill says that you will die from alcoholism if you don't follow his
instructions and work his program and do his 12 steps. (Bill also implied
that only his 12 steps embodied the <i>real spiritual principles</i>
of the Cosmos.)
<p>
Then, Bill Wilson spent many years
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk">touring the country,
grand-standing, breaking his anonymity, and selling A.A.</a> as the
answer to alcoholics' problems.
By 1944, Bill Wilson was the most famous &quot;anonymous&quot; person
in America.
Then Bill Wilson and Marty Mann even went and
<a href="orange-Bill_Senate.html">testified before Congress</a>,
pushing Alcoholics Anonymous as the solution to the nation's alcohol
problem. (That was, of course, a violation of the Eleventh Tradition, which says that
Alcoholics Anonymous is supposed to be a program of attraction, not promotion.
And talk about breaking your anonymity &#8212; you just can't do it any bigger than
by publicly testifying before Congress as the leader of Alcoholics Anonymous.)
<p>
So you can discard your statement that A.A. has never claimed to have
the answer to alcoholism. It has always claimed to have the answer,
and Wilson claimed that Alcoholics Anonymous <i>was THE answer</i>.

<p>
Oh, and one other thing: Please write to
<a href="orange-coffee.html">the Hazelden Foundation</a>
(in Center City, Minnesota, USA), and tell them
that A.A. does not have the answer to alcoholism, so please quit charging people
$15,000 for a 28-day stay where they teach the patients The Twelve Steps as the answer to
all alcohol and drug problems. And also tell
Hazelden to quit teaching A.A. members how to use the police and judges to force more
people into A.A. meetings as part of their 12th step work. (See
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Little_Red_Book">
The Hazelden Little Red Book</a>.)
<p>

You leave us with a big question: You say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has changed, and improved the
quality of my life beyond my wildest dreams&quot;</font>
even while you also say
that A.A. does not have the answer to alcoholism. So what exactly did A.A.
do for you if it didn't save you from alcoholism?

<p>
Is it going to be the &quot;wonderful brotherhood and fellowship&quot; rap, or will it be
the religious &quot;brought me to know God and gave me a spiritual way of life&quot; rap?
<p>
Looking forward to seeing your facts. Have a good day.

[Letter 2:]
<p>


Dear Sir,
<p>

I would prefer to address you by name, but you don't supply
one. I am certainly not going to call you 'Orange'
I appear to have been mistaken. Apparently you are an alcoholic. I'm left
wondering why you have so much antithesis toward AA, but you don't say.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I have often thought about breaking my anonymity. But so far, it looks unwise,
as it would create problems that I don't need.
</font><p>

You are equally mistaken about me. Working-class to the core, such stiffness
as I have comes from encroaching age. Haughty? - afraid not. I am eminently
approachable. I live too close to life to afford such dubious luxuries.
British I must confess to, 'tho I don't brag about it; (we all have a cross
to bear.)
<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, so I guess I've been watching too much Public Television, and my imagination
is getting the better of me. :-)<br>
Here in the USA, public TV is loaded with English
shows and those stilted accents. PBS just finished <i>The Forsyth Saga</i>, and they
always run <i>Keeping Up Appearances</i> and <i>Mystery Theater</i>, which is all
English stuff like Inspector Morse. And now they are also running <i>Rumpole of the
Bailey</i>. Oh well, enough of that.
</font><p>
<p>

It is difficult to engage in 'ad hominem' argument with someone one doesn't
know from Adam. - in fact, impossible- it becomes a tautology.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You're doing it again, right there.
</font><p>

I take issue with what you are saying; not who you are.
<p><font color="blue">
You take issue, but you don't supply any evidence to support your opinions.
</font><p>

<a name="not_scientific"> </a>
The old chestnut about Scientific Fact is whistling down the wind as far as
I am concerned. It would be an understatement to say it doesn't impress me.
Karl Popper I am impressed by.  He coined the notion of the 'Negative
Hypothesis.'<br>
It becomes a crutch in the hands of 'professional' sceptics of the James
Randi persuasion (now there is a con artist,) who use it completely
superficially and somewhat more indiscriminately than Popper - who think all
they have to say is 'I don't believe it, - prove it' and that lets them off
the hook from doing any more thinking. Who on earth said that Alcoholics
Anonymous was Scientifically based?<br>
It isn't, so how can it be subjested to any 'Scientific' scrutiny?<br>
In any event, Science is not Universal Omnipotent Truth, even less so the
actual practice of it (because it is practiced by Humans)<br>
I find 'Facts' such wonderful things. They can be arbitrarily assigned as
many different perspectives as the people who wield them like a Sword of
Damocles - Scientists are people, and they engage in this process just the
same, i.e.manipulate them.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is dangerous thin ice you are walking on. You dismiss scientific thinking
and facts as worthless?
<p>
You imply that Alcoholics Anonymous is not based on Science, and
has no scientific basis. I agree with that
statement. But what <i>*is*</i> A.A. based on, then? Superstition?
Faith in
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
the strange theology</a> of William G. Wilson? Wishful thinking? Voodoo medicine?<br>
<p>
<a name="scientific_testing"> </a>
For your information, a great many things, including the effectiveness of A.A.
as an alcoholism treatment program, can be tested, using the scientific method,
no matter whether they are &quot;based on Science&quot; or not.
<p>
For example, we could most assuredly test
<a href="orange-jokes.html#Baskins">my joke ballerina tutu program, or
the Baskin Robbins ice cream cure</a>, scientifically. And we could do it right alongside
testing A.A.. What we would do is: Get a group of 400 alcoholics from somewhere,
maybe a hospital or a court. Perhaps take 400 people who were
convicted of drunk driving, who have
been identified as &quot;alcohol abusers&quot; by a counselor or doctor,
and send them to one of four programs, randomly selected:
<ol>
<li> Dancing in a ballerina's tutu whenever alcohol cravings strike.
<li> Going to Baskin Robbins and eating ice cream whenever cravings strike.
<li> Going to Alcoholic Anonymous 3 times a week or more.
<li> No treatment of any kind. This is the control group, against which we measure
all of the other groups.
</ol>
Then we wait a year, to let the various treatment programs have time to work, and
then we count and measure, and we see how many alcoholics are abstaining, and how
many are still drinking abusively, how many are drinking moderately,
and how many are dead. And we compare those numbers to what the control group scored,
to see what the effect of the treatment actually was.
<p>

And that, dear sir, is the heart of the scientific method. Do you think that is an
unfair test? I don't.
<p>
Parts of that test have already been done. The first two, the ballerina dancing,
and the ice cream treatment, have not, to the best of my knowledge. But
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_treatment">the last
two have</a>. And the results were that <i>No treatment at all</i> was better than
A.A..
<p>
Lastly, if you dismiss facts as worthless, then what do you use as the basis
of your life? What do you trust? What do you base your decisions on?
Are you a follower of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Buchmanism</a> who believes
that the rational thinking mind is all a mistake,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#broken_reason">
an illusion to be gotten rid of</a>?
<p>
In fact, how are we to argue or discuss anything, if facts are worthless, and to
be dismissed if we don't like them?
<p>
I am reminded of the quote from the American Revolutionary War hero (to you,
the &quot;American Rebellion villain&quot;)
Ethan Allen, the leader
of the Green Mountain Boys in their capture of Fort Ticonderoga,
who had this to say on the subject:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those who invalidate reason ought seriously to consider
whether they argue against reason with or without reason; if with reason,
then they establish the principle that they are laboring to dethrone:
but if they argue without reason (which, in order to be consistent with
themselves they must do), they are out of reach of rational conviction,
nor do they deserve a rational argument.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed. If you dismiss all scientifically-determined facts as worthless because you don't
like them, or don't understand the scientific method, then upon what facts or method
of argument shall we base our discussion?
What methods of logic or thought are acceptable to your mind?
What kind of critical, skeptical, or logical thinking do you approve of, if any?
How shall we get some facts?

You would appear to have a personal grudge against AA, which, in and of
itself, is fine, &#8212; you may be perfectly justified. Perhaps you were badly
treated by someone in AA or whatever. But I am curious as to how this has
turned into what appears to me as a vendetta, and a determination to trash
the movement. It is obviously doomed to failure, and is absolutely
'whistling down the wind'
<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;The movement&quot; resembles the Bataan Death March more than anything
else.<br>
&quot;The movement&quot; is killing people, including friends and aquaintances,
by shoving ineffective voodoo
medicine and faith healing on a lot of people who are seeking something real
to help them with a deadly illness.
Lies don't work. Lies are not good. And
<a href="orange-aalies.html">A.A. lies all of the time</a>.
And A.A. is not
&quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Playfair">a useful lie</a>&quot;
like some of its proponents have called it.

<p>
Worse yet, A.A. still uses covert coercion to force more people into its meetings.
Every time you see somebody getting a slip signed, you are seeing another victim
of A.A.'s coercive recruiting schemes. (Perhaps you don't see it so much in England;
I hear that it is *much* more common in the USA than in England.)
<p>
A.A. is simply an evil cult, not a self-help group.
(I know that some of the individual members are quite well-meaning,
really nice people, but that does not make A.A. a good organization.)
A.A. is no more helpful or beneficial than Scientology, another cult based on
*non-Scientific* irrational babble.
Scientology also has a phony drug and alcohol
rehabilitation program called <i>Narconon</i> that claims to use
Scientology &quot;principles&quot; to &quot;fix addicts' minds.&quot;
(And a couple of my best friends were Scientologists, and wonderful people,
and that's how I know so much about Scientology. They were wonderful people,
but that doesn't make Scientology a wonderful organization.)

<a name="agenda"> </a>
You are absolutely, unquestioningly, entitled to your viewpoint. But it will
remain your viewpoint. You are the one who is stuck with it. You know that.
I know that. You can no more bring down AA by railing against it, than King
Canute could command the Sea to recede.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I want to end some specific bad practices. I doubt that I will ever see the
end of
<a href="orange-spirrel.html">the Alcoholics Anonymous religion</a>, <i>per se</i>.
(Likewise, I doubt if I will ever
see the ends of Scientology, the Hari Krishnas, or the Moonies. Heck, I still
<a href="orange-letters.html#Buchmanite1">actually get email</a> from followers of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a>. Believe it or not,
some of those nuts are still around.)
As I have said before, I don't care if some
crazy burned-out alcoholics want to huddle in church basements and convince each
other that they are
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#chosen_people">God's chosen children</a>.
I feel sorry for them. They are pathetic.

<p>
But I do want to end:
<ol>
<li> Coercive recruiting, using the legal system and health care systems to
shove more people into the cult.
<li> Medical malpractice, foisting cult religion and faith healing
on people as treatment for alcoholism
or drug addiction, and then charging people's health insurance plans for such
voodoo medicine.
<li> Constantly spreading misinformation about alcoholism, addiction, and recovery.
Such false information hurts people by making their recovery harder.
It even kills people.<br>
In particular, I want people to know that A.A. does not have an effective treatment
or cure for alcoholism. The over-all success rate of A.A. is zero or less, when compared to
the normal rate of spontaneous remission.

What do I get out of AA? - it teaches me Honesty, with which I make
painfully slow and imperfect progress. The fact that this has to do with me,
and me alone, is what I have brought into the programme myself.  There is a
lot more besides, and a lot more to be said, but enough for now. I must
work. I look forward to your reply, - I don't think we have finished
crossing swords just yet - perhaps even discovering your name.

How can you make claims to &quot;Honesty&quot; (with a capital 'H') 
when you dismiss a lot of facts
out of hand, just because you don't like them, or don't like where they came from,
or don't like who said them?
<p>
On what basis do you decide that you like some
facts, and will be &quot;Honest&quot; about them, while you automatically dismiss other
facts as being worthless? (Besides the obvious bias you have against &quot;Science&quot;
and skeptical thinking.)
How is that &quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#honesty">Honesty</a>&quot;?
It looks more like what Bill Wilson called
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice">prejudice</a>&quot;.
And it also looks like what Herbert Spencer called &quot;contempt prior to
investigation.&quot;
<p>
Or does &quot;Honesty&quot; just mean that you have learned to beat up on
yourself and believe
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">all kinds of negative things</a>
about yourself, and then
confess or &quot;admit&quot; those things in meetings,
because that is what you were told you had
to do, or else you would die of alcoholism?
<p>
Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>
By the way, I am <i>still</i> waiting to see some actual new facts here, rather than
just more <i>Ad Hominem</i> attacks on skeptical thinkers like James Randi.
<p>
And you seem to have forgotten about your absolute statement,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has never claimed to have the answer.
Does not claim so. Will never claim so.&quot;<br>

<font color="blue">
Hello, Cathy,
<p>
It took me a while, but I finally figured out that your &quot;.2&quot;
meant &quot;point two&quot; or &quot;item two&quot;, not two tenths of something.
<p>
What you are reading is paraphrased, not direct quotes. Most of that web page is
paraphrased. You have to go down to item four to see a direct quote.
It is clearly indicated by the fact that it is indented, block-quoted, and
displayed in a different font to make it stand out as a quote. Also, many
of the other direct quotes are also in quotation marks.
<p>
What I wrote is this: (Note how it is now formatted as a quote, because I am now
directly quoting myself.)

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li>
2. You are powerless over alcohol. You can't quit. Your life is unmanageable.
There you are,
facing ruin again, and still you can't stop. The more you struggle, the worse
you get. Even if
you quit drinking, we can prophesy that you will suffer from strange mental
blank spots
where will power and self-knowledge will be useless, and you will start
drinking again
without even knowing what you are doing. Your defense must come from a
Higher Power. (The
Big Book, 3rd Edition, William Wilson, pages 41-42.)
</ul>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

That statement is really assembled from several pages.
I referred to pages 41 to 42 because that is where the major items come from &#8212;
the &quot;prophesying&quot; of &quot;strange mental blank spots&quot; where
&quot;will power and self-knowledge will be useless&quot;.
<p>
The &quot;powerless over
alcohol&quot; and &quot;unmanageable lives&quot; phrases come from
Step One, of course, which is printed on page 59.
<p>
The line &quot;His defense must come from a Higher Power&quot; comes from
the bottom of page 43.
<p>
And frankly, I forget where I read the line <i>&quot;There you are,
facing ruin again, and still you can't stop. The more you struggle, the worse
you get.&quot;</i> But it's paraphrased from another one of those
standard &quot;you are powerless&quot; sermons.
<p>

I am surprised that you are incapable of recognizing any of those famous items as
coming from different parts of the <i>Big Book</i>. But whatever...
<p>

On to some more important points:
<ol>
<li> You are nit-picking. Declaring that the whole web site is invalid
because you don't understand paraphrasing is just another
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#nitpick">
bogus propaganda technique</a>, one which I have already written about.
The last nit-picker declared that the whole web site was invalid because I
had misspelled the name &quot;Henrietta Seiberling&quot;.
<p>
<a name="saved_millions"> </a>
<li> A.A. has not saved millions of lives. That is the standard
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">Big Lie</a> &#8212; another old
propaganda technique. Read the file
on &quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">The Effectiveness of the
Twelve Step Treatment</a>&quot;. Millions of people have been cycled through
the A.A. mill. A few quit drinking; most didn't. Those who quit drinking
did so in spite of A.A. as much as because of it. Basically, those who
quit drinking were those who were going to quit drinking anyway
because they were just sick
and tired of being sick and tired. Cult religion, voodoo medicine, and
faith healing is not a good treatment program for alcoholism.

<p>
<li> If A.A. saved lives I would be all for it. But the real evidence
shows that A.A. does not save lives. In fact, one of the leaders of A.A.,
Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, a member of the Board of
Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., showed by
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">his own
8-year long test</a> that A.A. kills.
Vaillant tried to prove that his beloved A.A. works, but
his A.A.-based treatment program had the
highest death rate of any program that he examined, a death rate
that Vaillant himself called &quot;appalling&quot;.
After 8 years of A.A. treatment, 29% of his patients were dead.
<p>
<i>Anything else</i>, including <i><b>no treatment at all</b></i> was
better than A.A.. But Professor Vaillant is such a true believer in the
12-step religion that he still wants to send all of the alcoholics to A.A.
anyway, to &quot;confess their sins to a high-status healer&quot;, even
if it won't save their lives.
<p>
<li> Likewise, a couple of other good scientific tests of A.A.
have also shown A.A. treatment to be
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_treatment">worse than no treatment</a>.

<p>
<li> I am not a paid counselor.

<p>
<li> I am being honest in what I am telling people. I go to great pains to
make sure that everything I write here is true. If anyone discovers any
error, which has happened a couple of times, I fix it immediately.
(By way of contrast,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">
the errors and falsehoods in the first 164 pages</a>
of the <i>Big Book</i> will <i>never</i> be fixed.)
It is Alcoholics
Anonymous that is not being honest. Open your eyes. You were reading
<a href="orange-aalies.html">a page</a>
which lists about 24 of the biggest lies that A.A. tells. They are real.
I'm telling the truth. A.A. isn't.
<p>
<li> You are correct when you say that not telling the truth may kill
people. A.A. kills people with its lies. That's why I feel that I have to
tell the truth about it.

How many lives does alcohol take if a person is a true alcoholic?
<br>
What ever it takes to have a useful, happy life and not a life full of pain,  is better then a active life with alcohol and full of pain, not to mention the pain it causes
for almost every person that is close to the alcoholic.  What happened in your life that made you so upset about AA?  My dad died a active alcoholic and I would
have gave anything to have seen him get sober and live a happy life. I am not a bible thumper but if he got sober by being a bible thumper I would have been
happy just that he was sober. What ever it takes, for someone suffering
from this disease, is a lot better then suffering with it.
I am sorry that you are so upset about this program
<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, Cathy,<br>
Starting at the top, you ask,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;How many lives does alcohol take if a person is a true alcoholic?&quot;
</font>
<p>
I don't know if that is a trick question or not, but the apparent answer would be,

Now I agree with that, within limits. We can obviously rule out grossly illegal

Then you ask,<br>
<font color="black">
What happened in your life that made you so upset about AA?

<p>
I'm getting tired of repeating the list, but here goes, one more time:
<ol>
<li> Bad therapy program, dogmatic cult religion instead of real therapy,
as described in <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>.
<li> Bad therapy program, dogmatic cult religion instead of real therapy,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">
as described in the page on The Bait-And-Switch Con Game</a>.
<li> Telling people with mental problems not to take their doctor-prescribed
medications, telling them that their sobriety wasn't complete if they were
taking medications. I have first-hand experience with this, as
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications">it was done to
my best friend</a> in the treatment program by his sponsor and the other old-timers
in his Dual Recovery group. (Before you object that that is D.R.A., not A.A.,
I must say that they are all
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html">the same 12-step religion</a>.)
<li> Generally stupid, bad advice given to friends who may well die because
of it, starting with the girl described in
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>,
and continuing with a lot of
<a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">others</a>.
<li> Cult religion, faith healing, and voodoo medicine is
not an effective cure for alcoholism. The A.A. program is useless, and a total
failure.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">It just does not work.</a> It even has
a success rate that is less than zero.
<li> Also, a few years off of the bottle does
not make someone a skilled therapist or a qualified recovery counselor, but
A.A. and N.A. are just chock full of self-proclaimed know-it-all sponsors
who feel entitled to deliver lectures on everything from God to medicine.
But once again, the only tool in their toolbox is the disproven, ineffective,
12-step program.
<li> Coercive Recruiting. Far too many 12-Steppers abuse their positions of
authority to force people to join their cult. I have personally seen a lot of
it, starting with my own
(<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">child-pornographer pedophile</a>) 12-step
&quot;counselor&quot; ordering
me to get a sponsor. Only 12-step groups have sponsors, so that was a veiled
order to join a 12-step group.
And he kept insisting, and I kept finding the sponsor candidates disgusting.
(Fortunately, he got sick, and was replaced by another counselor who didn't
push the issue, so I never got a sponsor.)
Then another friend lapsed (not relapsed) &#8212; he had a couple of
beers at his own birthday party &#8212; and was ordered to do 90 in 90 by his
housing counselor (the counselor who controls who gets to sleep in a shelter,
and who sleeps in the rain). When the friend said that he didn't like cult
religion and wanted to do some other kind of meetings besides 12-steps,
perhaps <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222536/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> or RR, the counselor
said, &quot;No, they <i>MUST</i> be 12-step meetings.&quot;
The friend quit the program and disappeared.
And it just goes on and on like that...
<p>
All of that is in addition to courts telling drunk drivers
&quot;90 meetings or 90 days in jail.&quot;
No other cult in America gets away with such stuff.
</ol>
<p>
Is that enough items for you?
<p>
Then you say,<br>
<font color="black">
My dad died a active alcoholic and I would 
have gave anything to have seen him get sober and live a happy life.
I am not a bible thumper but if he got sober by being a bible thumper
I would have been happy just that he was sober.
</font>
<p>
I can sympathize with that. My father died of alcoholism, too. And you know, he
went through all of the programs, a few years between them,
and none of them worked. Oh, they all worked for a while, but none of them
worked in the long run. First, there was the
Veterans Administration, and then he did a couple of years in a
Christian Brotherhood monastery
(relapsed the <i>first day</i> out of the monastery), and then he did 7 years
in A.A.. A.A. kept him sober longer than anybody else (7 years),
but he still went out and died drunk.
<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
Actually, I think I should rephrase that &#8212; he stayed sober in A.A. longer than in
either of the previous two programs. But he already had two terrible crash-and-burn
experiences to scare him into staying sober
(like crawling back from Mexico with burning veins &#8212; he had so much alcohol
in his blood that his veins were literally burning). He
had to know that if he relapsed again, it was the end. So that kept him
scared sober, for a while.
</font>

<p>
Now I don't blame A.A. for his death. He made his own choices, the same as we all
do. If I go out and kill myself, it's my own stupid fault and nobody else's.
<p>
But remember that the reverse is also true: If I stay sober and don't die from
alcoholism, then I get the credit, not some program.
<p>
The last part of your letter says that you would have been happy if he would
have gotten sober some way or other, and ...
<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;What ever it takes, for someone suffering from this disease,
is a lot better then suffering with it.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I understand. But wishful thinking does not
help anyone. Imagining that Alcoholics Anonymous has a working program is simply
wishful thinking. All that happens is, a few people out of the river of people
who go through the
rooms decide that they like the cult, so they stick around while they quit
drinking, and then A.A. takes the credit for their successes. If the A.A. program
actually worked, I would be all for it. I could even agree with the
rationalization that<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is a useful lie. It has a placebo effect that saves
lives.&quot;<br>
</font>
&#8212; if it worked, but it doesn't work. It doesn't save lives.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
It has a zero percent success rate, above normal spontaneous remission</a>,
or even less. Sometimes A.A. kills,
like Professor George Vaillant demonstrated.

I think it's pretty safe to say that all of the people
you see sitting in the rooms would have quit drinking anyway, without
A.A. or the Twelve Steps.
The real numbers say that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">
50% or more of all alcoholics finally just quit, rather than die, and 80% of them
do it alone</a>, without any &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>

Lastly you say,<br>
<font color="black">
I am sorry that you are so upset about this program.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Yeh, well, it came as a big surprise to me to find that voodoo medicine
and faith healing was actually the national
official &quot;treatment program&quot; for a deadly medical condition (not 'disease').
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I've heard of Bill's filandering and his use of LSD. All of us are
contradictory animals. Bill was a rightwing republican and supported
U.S. involvement in World War 2.
<p>

Myself, I have 20 1/2 years of sobriety so his legacy and program works.
The most important AA slogan we have is to thine own self be true.
Bill knew he was wrong to cheat on Lois but to him, sex felt good. It's
strange how women have such power over men biologically. These women
were individuals too and they could've refused his entreaties and
flirtations.
<p>

God has blessed me with being a homely man. And I do know that women
are an oppressed sex. I don't get along too good with attractive
women. Fortunately I have a beautiful wife thanks to my sobriety. Yes, men
are generally foul creatures and so sexually driven that they'll
forsake concious and morals for the opposite sex if they are so
empowered.
<p>

Leaders are magical people and they are needed in order to provide
humanity with direction when we are floundering as a species. Yet,
leaders are flawed. Every woman, man, and child has a part to play in our
world so we must let ourselves play the roles and fate will sort out
the winners from the losers and in heaven there will be no more secret
sealed archives.

Hello Brian,
<p>
Congratulations on your two decades of sobriety.
<p>
<a name="Dumbo"> </a>
But I can't agree on the
cause of your sobriety. I suspect that you are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">confusing cause and effect
with correlation or coincidence</a>. It's just like Dumbo's Magic Flying Feather.
(Remember the Walt Disney movie <i>Dumbo</i>?)
He couldn't fly until he got that magic feather; then he could.
Dumbo just &quot;knew&quot; that the feather was the cause of his success.
Likewise, many A.A. members are convinced that their sobriety was caused
by the 12 steps, or by going to meetings, or by some other part of the
A.A. program, rather than by the fact that they are sober because they
are not swallowing alcoholic drinks any more, and that was their own
choice and their own accomplishment. They ignore obvious factors
like that they quit drinking because they got tired of the down side,
the horrible negative consequences of drinking.
They got sick and tired of being sick and tired.
They decided that they wanted to live.
They did all of the hard work and A.A. took all of the credit.

<p>
This is a common problem. <i>Quackwatch</i> wrote:

Many dubious methods remain on the market primarily because satisfied
customers offer testimonials to their worth. Essentially, these people say:

Many diseases are self-limiting. If the condition is not chronic or fatal,
the body's own recuperative processes usually restore the sufferer to
health. Thus, to demonstrate that a therapy is effective, its proponents
must show that the number of patients listed as improved exceeds the number
expected to recover without any treatment at all (or that they recover
reliably faster than if left untreated). Without detailed records of
successes and failures for a large enough number of patients with the same
complaint, someone cannot legitimately claim to have exceeded the published
norms for unaided recovery.<br>...<br>

Before agreeing to any kind of treatment, you should feel confident that it
makes sense and has been scientifically validated through studies that
control for placebo responses, compliance effects, and judgmental errors.
You should be very wary if the &quot;evidence&quot; consists merely of testimonials,
self-published pamphlets or books, or items from the popular media.<br>

<p>
That is precisely the problem with a few A.A. survivors (out of hundreds
of failures) claiming that A.A. or
the Twelve Steps made them quit drinking.
Only a well-designed test can be trusted, and all of those tests have shown that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
A.A. does not make people quit drinking</a>. A.A. scores no better than any other
treatment, or no treatment at all.

Again, it's the same old problem as:<br>

<p>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc">That goofy logic</a> is

<p>

Bill Wilson's sexual infidelity is not a major point; it is just
another hypocrisy.
Other faults were far more important:
<br>
<ol>
<li> The &quot;spiritual&quot; cure for alcoholism is a hoax and doesn't work.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">The claimed success rate
is a fraud</a>, and Bill Wilson knew that.
He &quot;cooked the books&quot; while writing
the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>.
<li> The A.A. program is sheer insanity. It is literally the ravings
of a lunatic. See the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">The Funny Spirituality
of A.A.</a>&quot;.
<li> Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">robbed A.A. for everything he could get</a>.
He wasn't just a quirky leader, he was a felon, guilty of grand theft
and securities fraud.
In
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">the <i>Big Book</i> deal</a>, he was
supposed to get
<a href="orange-Prosp09.jpg" target="newwin1">
$1000 for writing
the opening chapters</a> of the
book as flat-rate contract labor (see the &quot;author&quot; item), while
<a href="orange-Prosp05.jpg" target="newwin2">
the Alcoholic Foundation was
supposed to get the royalties</a>.
After Bill stole the copyright to the book, he blackmailed A.A. into giving him
royalties for life.
When other members objected to Bill's dishonesty, 
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith">Dr. Bob told them not to make
trouble</a>, for the good of the fellowship. Then Bill cut Dr. Bob in on the deal
and Dr. Bob also got royalties for life.
Nobody else got anything. On top of that, A.A. then bought Bill a
Cadillac car and a house in the country. Not bad for writing 9 or 10
chapters and stealing Henry Parkhurst's work, as well as the work of
all of the other authors.
<li> All that Bill Wilson did to get his &quot;spiritual&quot; cure for
alcoholism was
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
repackage the Oxford Group cult religion</a>. It was a bad
cult when Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman ran it, and it was still bad when Bill Wilson
ran it.
<li> A.A. kills. All of the fair and unbiased tests of the A.A. program
have shown that A.A.
is no better than any other &quot;treatment&quot; program, or even no
treatment at all. In fact, some tests have shown that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_treatment">A.A. is <i>worse</i>
than no treatment</a>. Even one of the leaders of A.A., Professor George
Vaillant, showed with
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">his own 8-year test of A.A.</a>,
that A.A. had a higher death rate than anything else. After eight years of
A.A. &quot;treatment&quot;, 29% of Vaillant's patients were dead.
<li> A.A. immorally, illegally, and unconstitutionally
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Little_Red_Book">uses covert coercion to
recruit new members</a>.

</ol>
<p>
Bill Wilson's sexual infidelity pales beside big problems like that.
If the A.A. program really worked, and cheating on his wife was his
only hypocrisy, I'd also be ready to label him a great man.
But he was just a sleazy con artist and a fraud.
<p>
But there is one aspect of that sexual infidelity that we should not
overlook:
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">
Bill was exploiting women who came to A.A. seeking help
with their alcoholism</a>. It would have been a very different thing
if Bill Wilson had had affairs with women outside of A.A., but that isn't
what Bill did. Bill chose
to act as a sexual predator and victimize women who were sick, weak,
shaky, and desperately seeking help. That is unconscionable.
That is not the behavior of a healer.
Any doctor who screws his women patients gets his license to practice
medicine revoked.

<p>
I strongly disagree with the statement,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Leaders are magical people and they are needed in order to provide
humanity with direction when we are floundering as a species.&quot;
</font>
<br>
First off, we aren't floundering as a species.<br>
Secondly, we don't need
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right">charismatic cult leaders</a>.<br>
Third, Bill Wilson wasn't magical, and he wasn't leading us anywhere.<br>
<p>
He was just feathering his own nest so that he never had to work again.
He made a lot of loud grandiose claims of success when he had
nothing but failure to show for his cult religion.
Bill Wilson didn't even introduce new concepts about recovery from
alcoholism or a more charitable attitude towards alcoholics.
Bill pointedly overlooked the contributions of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery">the
earlier temperance movements</a>
like the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Washingtonian Society,
and the Keeley League.

<p>
Bill was really not much different from all of those phony TV evangelists who were
sent to prison in the last couple of decades. I seem to recall that they
were also fundamentalists and Republicans, too. (They had good reason
to want to &quot;get big government off of the little businessman's back.&quot;
Those darned pesky laws against grand theft and criminal fraud were such
an inconvenience... &#8212; A problem that a Republican corporation called
Enron would run into a little later.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. Thanks for writing.

<a name="why_cult"> </a>
Hi, loved your site. I'm curious though, if AA is a cult, what are its members 
in it for? I should clarify &#8212; Scientology exists as a moneymaking 
organization, but since AA is non-profit, what are its unofficial &quot;leaders&quot; 
hoping to gain? Just curious.<br>
-R.S.
<p>

<font color="blue">
Hi, R.S.,<br>
That's a good question. And I think that the answer, to a great extent,
is pretty much the same as why people stay in all of the other cults.
The list of things that comes to mind is:
<p>
<ol>
<li> To avoid death. That is, members believe that membership in A.A.
will save them from a horrible death by alcoholism. Conversely, they
have been made to believe that if they leave A.A., they are doomed
to die drunk in a gutter. That is the standard cult practice,
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias">
<i>Phobia Induction</i></a>, implanting fears and making members afraid to leave.

<p>
<li> Social club. They enjoy the social get-togethers. It is their
circle of &quot;friends&quot;.<br>
The flip side of this item is, if they quit A.A.,
their &quot;friends&quot; won't like them any more.

<p>
<li> Social Status. The old-timers have a lot of accumulated Time and status,
and are the honored elders and Trusted Servants inside of A.A.. But outside
of A.A., they have no special status, and are just some more old nobodys...

<p>
<li> Feelings of Grandiose Self-importance.
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">We are special</a>&quot;
&quot;<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html">We are chosen</a>.&quot;</i>
They feel that they are doing
the Will of God, and &quot;helping others selflessly&quot; by recruiting
more cult members.
<p>
Many cult members like to imagine that their cult
is <i>The Wave Of The Future</i>, a big movement that is sweeping the world,
ushering
in <i>The New Age of Peace and Enlightenment</i>, and A.A. is no different.
A.A. members call it things like
&quot;<a href="orange-letters3.html#the_movement">The Movement</a>&quot;.

A.A. members imagine that A.A. is actually some new
enlightened mode of recovery from alcohol or drugs that will sweep the
world and reform &quot;the recovery community&quot;,
rather than just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">a recycled, tired old cult religion</a>
with no new answers to anything.
<p>

<li> Sacred Science &#8212; Only A.A. has the magic answer. Members actually believe
the cult dogma, and actually believe that only this group has <i>THE BIG ANSWER</i>.
And they believe that they really have to go recruit more cult members, in
order to save their lives.
(BOTH lives. That is, that sentence works both ways: They believe that 
they have to recruit to save the other people's lives, and they believe 
that they have to go recruiting to save their own lives.)
And they believe that they have to indoctrinate
and convert newcomers for their own good. (Again, for the good of both of them.)
And they believe that any newcomer who disagrees with the cult dogma is of
course diseased and <i><b>in denial</b></i>, because A.A. teachings are of
course the true and correct answer to everything.
<p>
And of course they reject any information that does not accord with their
own beliefs; it has to be wrong, automatically, because it doesn't
accord with their own beliefs. That circular logic keeps people brainwashing
themselves endlessly, and never learning anything different.

<p>
(Oh, and by the way, here is where Scientology is not &quot;just in it for
the money.&quot; Some cynical branch managers may be, but the rank and file
actually do believe that Scientology has fantastic new technology [LRH tech]
that will solve all of their mental problems and give them great mind powers
&#8212; even immortality.
&#8212; Which leads to the following item:)

<p>
<li> The Promised Goodies. All cults hold out the promise of something great if
you kiss enough ass and follow the rules long enough.
They offer enlightenment, spiritual virtue, sainthood, immortality, a ticket to Heaven,
mental, physical, or spiritual powers, recovery, sanity, or something.
<p>
In A.A.,
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises">
<i><b>The Promises</b></i></a> are even written up as a formal list.
Bill Wilson promised members a whole lot more than just sobriety or survival.

<p>
Conversely, they say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't Leave Five Minutes Before The Miracle!&quot;<br>
</font>
So you can't ever leave, or you will miss out on the promised goodies.

<p>
<li> Old-timers don't want to admit that they have been so wrong for so
long.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>&quot;Do you expect me to believe that I wasted 12 years of my life
in a cult?&quot;</i></font><br>
That was a real statement made by an A.A. member in a newsgroup.
He wasn't about to believe that he had wasted so many years in a cult.
So that person will continue to convince himself that it is a wonderful
organization, not a cult, just because he doesn't want to believe that he wasted
a lot of time on something foolish.<br>
As they say in A.A.,
<font color="#BF0000">
Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
</font>

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_giggly">
<i>Giggly Wonderfulness and Starry-Eyed Faith</i></a> is a lot of fun
for some people.
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#make_believe">Spiritual make-believe</a>
is a real kick. It's a lot more fun to imagine that you
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Broad_Highway">are on the Broad Highway,
walking hand in hand with The Spirit of the Universe</a>&quot;, than to imagine that you
are just another person who has been unwise.
<p>
In addition, it just seems to be a common human trait that
people wish to feel that their suffering was for some higher purpose. It is
a lot easier for people to believe that they went through Hell so that they would be
prepared to help others, than to believe that they went through Hell solely because they
made some foolish choices.

<p>
<li> Absolute Certainty. Dogmatic cult religions say that you don't need
to worry about being wrong:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>&quot;There is no question that we are absolutely
right about everything, and have a simple answer to everything.&quot;<br>
&quot;The answer to all problems is 'Do the Twelve Steps, Get a sponsor,
and Read the Big Book.'&quot;</i><br>
</font>
Such simple, absolutely-true answers also spare the cult member from the hard
work of thinking, and let him avoid the discomfort of having doubts.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers">
Disturbed Followers</a>.
Some members have mental problems. First they were obsessed with
drinking alcohol, and now they are obsessed with cult religion.
People who insist on believing a bunch of illogical, irrational, unrealistic,
contradictory nonsense really do need their heads examined.
</ol>
<p>
One item that is missing from the list is, of course, a charismatic leader.
The current A.A. leaders, like the executives and trustees of A.A.W.S.
(Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.), do live very comfortable
lives and enjoy a lot of status and prestige, but they seem to me to
be almost irrelevant (except for
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">the crimes that they commit</a>).
A.A. is one of those cults with dead leaders, like the Hari Krishnas or
Scientology or Siddha Yoga, where current members now just worship the
dead founders.
Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob are of course the dead saints
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
And last but not least, the members actually do quit and leave. 
All of the above items imply that members stay in the group.
Some do, but not for very long. A.A. suffers from a horrendous dropout rate.
The A.A. clubhouse has a revolving door on the front of it.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">The A.A. G.S.O.'s own surveys</a>
have shown that 81% are gone after a month, 90% are gone after 3 months,
and 95% are gone after a year.
And the attrition continues, with 
<a href="orange-letters.html#Bernie">even 20-year old-timers dropping out</a>.
A.A. even has to use
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">coercive recruiting 
techniques</a> to keep its numbers up. It isn't growing any more.

<p>
So thanks for the question. That was a good one.
<p>
Have a good day.
