Before considering the attached proposal, certain information
should be known by the reader.
<p>Informed doctors and psychiatrists consider true alcoholism
just as much a diease as cancer. The bodies of those subject to
alcoholism have become abnormal in reaction and mind even
more so. This has been called an allergy. Many alcoholics are men
of exceptional character and willpower, as proven by the type of
men that make up Alcoholics Anonymous. Among the recoveries
are men from every profession, and practically every type of
business. People not familiar with the subject think alcoholism is
a habit based upon physical craving. This is absolutely not true,
for when not drinking, no physical craving exists. This is proven
by the following fact: Physicians state that a maximum of six
months abstinence removes any physical craving and yet it
commonly occurs that men start to drink again after having been
confined in an institution for as much as a year. It has been
repeatedly stated by the world's leading doctors that they have no
answer save for the very mildest of cases.

<p>
It is an indisputable fact that over the past four years over one-
hundred true alcoholics have recovered, who from the standpoint
of medicine and psychiatry, were considered hopeless. These men
have dubbed themselves Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Another indisputable fact is that during 1937, thirty-five
percent of the life insurance turn downs were due to alcoholism.
A realization is coming to public, professional and business men
that there exists today an alcoholic problem which takes its place
in seriousness with cancer and syphilis. Magazine and news
articles on the subject bring incredible response.

<p>
The name Alcoholics Anonymous has been adopted because of
the nature of the work, because of the desire to keep away from
notoriety, and because the work is strictly non-sectarian.

<h2>BRIEF RESUME OF THE WORK OF
<br>
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS</center></h2>
</center>
<p>

About four years ago William G. Wilson had been pronounced
an incurable alcoholic. Doctors and psychiatrists have agreed that
the only way out for the true alcoholic is through a so-called
spiritual experience and it matters little what form this experience takes


<p>
In November of 1934, a school friend came to Mr. Wilson's
house with certain information that has undoubtedly saved his live
and the lives of many others. Mr. Wilson's friends outlined a
procedure for a simple spiritual approach, and through its use Mr.
Wilson was released from alcoholism
<p>
At that time certain ideas came to him which form the basis of
the events which have since transpired. Mr. Wilson realized first
of all, that to be acceptable to the ordinary men of the world, the
spiritual feature must be simple and understandable. He saw that
the particular spiritual approach presented: to him had these
characteristics, and could even be further simplified and made
effective. Because the approach had the elements of universal
appeal, he wondered why so comparatively little success had been
secured from the spiritual approach with other alcoholics He
conceived the idea that it was because the matter was so often
presented to an alcoholic by a non-alcoholic; that there was not
sufficient basis for initial mutual confidence. He realized that one
alcoholic could gain the confidence of another to an extent that
no other person in the world could.

<p>
The idea took hold of Mr. Wilson's imagination, for he
envisioned one alcoholic helping another; that one helping still
another and so on. After his release from Towns Hospital Mr.

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>
Wilson began to return there to talk to some of the patients.
Several caught the idea and bear witness today to the effectiveness
of those first approaches.
<p>It occured to Mr. Wilson that accurate and reliable medical
information should be in the possession of every alcoholic when
he approached another alcoholic With such equipment the new
prospect could be readily persuaded that he was hopeless, that he
is, in actual fact at the jumping off place.

<p>Being convinced there was no other way out, the new man
would look with more favor and willingness upon a spiritual
method in spite of any prejudice he might have had.
In the spring of 1935 Mr. Wilson went to Akron, Ohio, on
business. While there he communicated his ideas to three other
alcoholics. Leaving the three men, he returned to New York in
the fall of 1935, continuing his activities there. These early seeds
are now bearing amazing fruit. The original Akron three have
expanded themselves into more than seventy. Scattered about
New York and in the seaboard states there are about forty. Men
have even come out of insane asylums and resumed their
community and family lives. Business and professional people
have regained their standing.

<a name="unprecedented"> </a>
<p>
In all, about two-hundred cases of hopeless alcoholism have
been dealt with. As will be seen, about fifty percent of these have
recovered. This, of course, is unprecedented -- never has such a
thing happened before.
<p>This work has claimed the attention of prominent doctors and
institutions who say without hesitation that in a few years time, as
it gains impetous, thousands of hitherto incurable cases may
recover. Such people as the chief physician of Charles B. Towns
Hospital and psychiatrists of the Johns Hopkins Hospital at
Baltimore express such opinions.

<p>
<center> <h2> THE PRESENT PROGRAM </h2> </center>
<p>

It has been felt vitally necessary to spread the work widely and
get it on a sound basis rapidly.
<p>The first step has been the establishment of a trust known as
The Alcoholic Foundation. This trust is administered by a board
of three well-known business men who are non-alcoholics, and by
two members of Alcoholics Anonymous The articles of the trust
specifically set forth that non-alcoholic members shall always be
in a majority of one over the alcoholic members. The Alcoholic
Foundation will, in order to obviate any possible criticism,
administer the financial affairs of the group.
<p>When it is considered that there are an estimated million
alcoholics in this country the obligation for wide spread of the
work may be perceived Education and instruction should be
made available to every one touched by a drink situation. An
understanding of the nature of the disease and its cure must be
mastered by wives, relatives and employers of alcoholics. A
definite program of attitude and action should be offered everyone
concerned. It is felt that these aims may be gained by the
publishing of an anonymous volume based upon the past four
years experience.
<p>
<a name="royalty"> </a>
The publishing of this book, to be known as &quot;One Hundred
Men,&quot; is the subject of the attached material The Alcoholic
Foundation will receive an author's royalty as a donation for the
furtherance of the work.
<p>Considering the necessity for a volume of this kind; its being
based upon actual experience; the publicity that has been
assured, and the tremendous amount of good inherent in its
results; anyone must agree with a former editor of the New York
Times, who after reading the first two chapters predicted a
sensational sale. (Ten chapters have now been written).

<h3> <center> THE PROPOSAL </center> </h3>

It is proposed to form &#151;
<br>
<center>
&quot;THE ONE HUNDRED MEN CORPORATION.&quot;
</center>

<br>

<h3><center>PURPOSE</center></h3>

To publish the book &#151; &quot;One Hundred Men&quot;
<br>
<center><h3>ASSETS</h3></center>

Money has been subscribed to maintain the author for five
<br>months. A completely equipped office.

<center><h3>THE ISSUE</h3></center>

Sufficient $25.00 par value shares to promote publicity, sales,
and publish the book. Shares either payable in full at time of
subscription, or five dollars for each share subscribed at time of
subscription and five dollars per share each thirty days for four
months after subscription.
&nbsp;

<h3><center>THE CORPORATION</center></h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Stock &#151; Non-Assessable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Delaware Corporation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
____________
<br>&nbsp;

<h3> <center>F A C T S</center> </h3>

The following facts are pertinent in considering the possible
<br>success of the volume-&quot;One Hundred Men.&quot;
<br>1. Publicity
<br>2. Established Publishers' Opinion
<br>3. The Possible Market.

<p>
PUBLICITY &#151; 1. Of publicity value is the fact that the foundational
soundness of the work is verified by letters from The Johns
Hopkins Hospital, and the chief physician of Charles B. Towns
Hospital, one of the foremost alcoholic institutions in the United
States Furthermore the work has been investigated and justified
most thoroughly by private parties from an outside source.

2. The syndicated magazine This Week, (included with Sunday
New York Herald Tribune and many other Sunday news
papers) has expressed an interest in running a page two article
regarding the work and the forthcoming book The editor
prophesied from fifteen to twenty thousand inquiries from the
weekly circulation of five million two hundred and fifty thousand
This syndicated magazine section for Sunday newspapers is
second only to the American Weekly used by Hearst papers.

<p>
3. The Readers Digest, in a personal interview with the
Managing Editor, stated that the work and the forthcoming
volume were of such interest as to justify their placing a staff
writer on it and running an exclusive article just prior to
publication of the volume.
<p>4. Mr. Wainright Evans, established author, wrote Mr. Bigelow,
Editor of Good Housekeeping magazine, a letter regarding the
work. Two of the members of Alcoholics Anonymous in company
with Mr. Evans called upon Mr. Bigelow who requested Mr. Evans
to submit an outline of the completed article which he believed
would be used by the magazine just prior to the issuance of the
book.

<p>
5. A fact pertinent to one's calculations as to the possible
public interest should be the results of the publication last spring
of an article entitled &quot;The Unhappy Drinker&quot; in the Saturday
Evening Post The Post commented that more inquiries came to
them from this than from any other article they had ever printed.

<p>
6. Approximately a year ago a very obscure article was
published by Doctor Silkworth in a small New York Medical
journal. He barely alluded to this work, simply saying that such a
thing was happening. He was amazed by the hundreds of inquiries
received from lay people all over the United States.

<p>
7. Established publishers have said both directly and by
implication that this volume seems assured of the most unusual
publicity preceding publication of any book they have known.

<p>
ESTABLISHED PUBLISHERS OPINION &#151; Established pub-

<p>

lishers must practically see a sure fire book in order to make an
advance to an author. Furthermore they are exceptionally careful
that this advance is conservative in order that it may be returned
from royalties on sales. Harper &amp; Bros. after reading the first two
chapters, investigating the publicity, and talking to two members
of Alcoholics Anonymous, offered fifteen hundred dollars as an
advance against royalties. This is impressive in view of the fact
that five thousand volumes would need to be sold to repay the
advance.

<p>
In the course of publishing investigation, these same two
members of Alcoholics Anonymous called upon Mr. Walsh,
owner of the John Day Publishing Company, publishers of such
volumes as The Good Earth, The Importance of Living, etc. This
call was made upon the basis of a personal friendship with Mr.
Walsh and as a consequence the advice given by him was upon a
friendly basis rather than securing the publishing of the book.
Not only did Mr. Walsh give invaluable printing, credit, and sales
information, but predicted an unusual sale for the volume. He
said, and gave reasons for his opinion which will be outlined later,
that he could not see where this venture would gain through using
an established publisher.

<p>
THE POSSIBLE MARKET &#151; It has been estimated that there
are over a million alcoholics in the United States and that every
family seems touched by the problem. If this is so, and we have
been assured that there has never been any published work that
not only gave the answer, but told a man what to do to recover,
then this book should have an incredible sale.

<p>
One Hundred Men will not only have an appeal to the alcoholic
layman, and those affected, but should appeal to the five hundred
thousand Clergymen in this country, the three hundred and fifty
thousand Physicians, and the twenty odd thousand established
Psychiatrists. We know that the problem is one of pressing
concern to large corporations, and we know also that special
reprints should be interesting to insurance companies.
Taken these few fundamental market facts into consideration,
along with the publicity that seems assured, who can estimate the
possible sale?

<center><h3> CORPORATE SET-UP</h3></center>

The corporation is set up on a budget that runs to April 1st. By
that time the book will be out and further sales plans will need to be
made upon experiences to date.

<p>
However for full protection of the shareholders the shareholders
procedure will be set up in the articles of the corporation.
On each of the first 1000 books, eighty cents will be apportioned
among the shareholders who have made a cash subscription.
On each of the second 1000 books, seventy cents will be
apportioned among the shareholders.

<p>
On each book over 2000 books and until the subscriptions have
been returned, sixty cents will be apportioned to the shareholders.
The difference between the above payments and the gross profit
will accrue in the corporate treasury. It is planned to call a
stockholders' meeting in March, 1939, to vote as to whether the
corporation shall distribute cash on hand to the stockholders, or
continue maintaining headquarters for the direct sales of the book.

<center> <h3> PROFITS</h3> </center>
<p>

As said before any accurate estimating of profits cannot even
be approached.
<p>For anyone who wishes to draw their own estimate, the
following figures and-facts are given:
<p>It would take sales of the first 5000 volumes (basis Harpers
advance offer) by April first to assure subscribers money. Inasmuch
as the budget has been designed to defray all expenses of
operation to April 1st, profits up to that date are gross profits,
without deductions.

<p>

On the other hand if office were maintained through April,
May and June and five thousand volumes only were sold, the
returns to the shareholders would be slightly over fifty percent. As
mentioned before, decision as to continuance of the office
through April, May and June, will be made at the stockholders'
meeting in March, 1939.

<p>
If, on the other hand, any success such as has been predicted
accrues, the following profit projection would seem possible.

<p>
<a name="big_returns"> </a>
By June first the subscription would have been returned. Then,
if the following sales are reached the profit per share would be:

Although it seems ridiculous, one estimate has been made of half a

dollars per share would be returned.

<center> <h3> OPERATION OF THE
<br> ONE HUNDRED MEN CORPORATION </h3> </center>

<p>

During the time of the writing of the book, and while sales
promotional and directional duties are going on, the necessity of
an office is apparent
<p>
Among other sales promotional possibilities that must be
followed up is the offer of Floyd Parsons to write an article based
upon the book for the Saturday Evening Post. Mr. Parsons is very
well acquainted with the editor and believes an article would be
acceptable.
<p>
Most of the church organizations have their National Offices in
New York City. These must all be followed up. The National
Library Board has its headquarters in New York City. This must
be canvassed, as must the American Medical Society. It may be
possible to have articles in those publications.
<p>
Some of the larger purchasers beside the jobbers must be
approached. It is customary for sales to people such as Macy's to
be made direct by the publisher.
<p>

On April first, when the book has been published, the decision
will be reached by the stockholders as to the continuance of the
office. If sales are going at a very rapid rate, there would be no
question as to the necessity of the office.
<p>

There is naturally a question as to what would be done after
April first if an office is not necessary. One of the usual printing
services extended by book printers to publishers is that of
shipping. The printer will attend to all details such as billing,
collecting the money, and shipping for a publisher at cost In
other words, it is possible to turn over to a regular book printer all
physical detail except writing, selling, and publicity.
<p>
A fact not generally realized is that book publishers do no
printing. The printing, the art work, and all work attendant to

<p>
issuing the book is done by specialized book printers. One of the
duties of the management of the corporation will be attending to
the printing details. Mr. Walsh of the John Day Printing Company
recommended any one of three printers competent to handle all
details.
<p>
Another question is that of distribution and credit to book
stores. There are only three book jobbers in the United States;
any one of whom covers the entire country. Their credit is of the
highest and they in turn take off the publishers hands all questions
in regard to credit risks to the retail store. We have been told that
we will have no trouble in securing any one of these three jobbers.
Taken all in all, there are plenty of details to be taken care of
and sales promotional work to be done between the present time
and April first.
