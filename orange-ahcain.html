<h2>Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?</h2>
<h3>by Arthur H. Cain</h3>
</center>

<p>
A useful idea has turned into a religious movement &#8212; and a hindrance to
research, psychiatry, and to many alcoholics who need a different kind
of help.

<p>
In the beginning &quot;They&quot; created Alcoholics Anonymous. (&quot;They&quot; have not
yet been credited with the creation of the heavens and earth, but, if
present trends continue, they will be.) &quot;They are &quot;W.W.&quot; and &quot;Dr.
Bob&quot; &#8212; cofounders of a movement which is becoming one of America's most
fanatical religious cults: &quot;AA&quot;

<p>
To be sure, the late Dr. Bob and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#denied_recovery">the very current
W.W. did not want to be deified</a>.
They joined forces in 1935 simply to help each other stop
drinking. Today the fellowship they started claims a membership of over
300,000 &quot;arrested&quot; alcoholics in 85 countries. The A.A. idea was based
on psychological and spiritual concepts very similar to those of Frank
Buchman's then-famous Oxford Group. Conceived in Akron, Ohio, the first
AA. Group was formed in New York City. In A.A.'s first five years no
more than a few hundred people joined.

<p>
Then, in 1941,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Jack_Alexander">an article about A.A. by Jack Alexander</a>
appeared in the
<i>Saturday Evening Post</i> and gave the movement an overnight boost.
Membership leaped to over eight thousand by the end of the year.

<p>
A.A.'s basic tenet is that only an alcoholic can help another
alcoholic; that psychiatric and other treatment is usually
unsuccessful; but that alcoholics can, by banding together in a spirit
of mutual help and understanding (and &quot;by turning their lives over to
God as they understand Him&quot;), manage to lead relatively normal lives.
Above all, they must face the fact that they must never again taken
even one drink of alcohol.

<p>
As long as it restricted itself to informal organization and group
&quot;therapy,&quot; A.A. enjoyed &#8212; and deserved &#8212; universal respect. But a
disquieting change has developed over the past fifteen years. A.A. is
now highly formalized. The meetings, believed to be absolutely
necessary, are ritualistic. And any suggestion to members that The
Program is less than divine revelation evokes an irrational outcry.

<p>
I have no personal axe to grind. As a practicing psychologist who
specializes in alcohol problems, I have been active since 1947 in both
therapy and research. I have worked closely with Alcoholics Anonymous.
I have also worked for the National Council on Alcoholism and for the
Christopher D. Smithers Foundation, a charitable organization whose
major interests are alcoholism and cancer.

<p>
I am disturbed by the fact that, for many members, A.A. is not as
effective as it once was.

<p>
Moreover, I feel that much-needed scientific research is being diverted
to other fields because of A.A.'s omniscient attitude. And I am not
alone in my concern.
<font color="blue">
Frequently in my practice, disillusioned men and
women appeal to me: &quot;Doctor, I've tried AA. over and over and I still
can't stay sober. There must be something else dreadfully wrong with
me! What is it?&quot;
</font>

<p>
My friends in psychiatry, psychology, and pastoral counseling often ask
me in discreet tones, &quot;What's happening to AA?&quot; Then, embarrassed at
sounding critical, they add hastily, &quot;It is a wonderful organization.&quot;
<font color="blue">
Dr. E. M. Jellinek, dean of researchers in alcohol studies, pleaded at
a workshop on alcoholism held at Columbia University in June 1959 that
A.A. leave science alone &#8212; so that scientists might get along with the
business of objective research into the problem.
</font>

<p>
While serving as public-relations counsel to the National Council on
Alcoholism in 1959, I attended A.A. meetings in a dozen major cities.
This personal survey of AA. groups convinced me that there is a
widening breach not only between A.A. and scientists, but also between
practicing A.A.s and other alcoholics.

<p>
What has happened to the excellent program that once helped alcoholics
stop drinking when medicine and psychology failed?
<font color="blue">
Why has A.A. become
a cult that many men and women reverentially call &quot;the greatest
movement since the birth of Christianity&quot;?
</font>

<p>
<b>&quot; UTILIZE &#8212; DON'T ANALYZE&quot;</b>

<p>
I attended my first A.A. meeting in 1947 and was enormously impressed
by the sincerity of the members. They were not professional do-gooders.
The speakers seemed genuinely &quot;humble,&quot; not piously proud of their
humility. The &quot;A.A. Personality&quot; &#8212; identifiable by a studied air of
serenity and steadfast smile (which I have come to think of,
uncharitably, as the &quot;A.A. Smirk&quot;) &#8212; had not yet come into existence. It
is a product of &quot;AA.: the Cult&quot; as opposed to &quot;A.A.: the Fellowship.&quot;

<p>
But one remark disturbed me even then. One man arose &#8212; a forerunner of
the seer-and-pundit type now prevalent in A.A. &#8212; and declared,
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#aggregate_experience">There's
an aggregate of two thousand years of drinking experience in this
meeting room. If we don't understand alcoholism then nobody does.</a>&quot; My
own reaction was that nobody understood alcoholism (no one does now,
either) and
<font color="#9F0000">
it was ludicrous for a group which admittedly had lost
control of its drinking to claim superior knowledge of the subject.
</font>

<p>
As I began to attend meetings regularly, other aphorisms troubled me.
One favorite clich&eacute; appeared to be of special importance and still is:
&quot;Utilize &#8212; don't analyze.&quot;

<p>
For some members this was fine. They were weary of trying to figure out
how to drink normally; or how to endure sobriety now that it was
achieved; or why they had become alcoholic in the first place. They
were ready to accept blindly anything that would end the agonies of
compulsive drinking.

<p>
But for others, such faith was impossible.

<p>
Some people simply must analyze &#8212; it is their most characteristic
personality trait. Perhaps, during the early, frightening days of their
newly found sobriety they take comfort in letting others think for
them. But as their heads clear and their nerves stop quivering, the
need to comprehend ideas intellectually is reasserted and they find
themselves examining their own behavior with healthy curiosity. As one
relapsed member mournfully described his &quot;slip&quot;: &quot;I had been dry for
over a year and, like the window washer, stepped back to appraise my
handiwork. I woke up two weeks later on the Flight Deck [the violent
ward at Kings County Hospital] wondering what had happened.&quot;

<p>
Relapses occur frequently among such alcoholics trying to stay sober in
A.A. Many A.A. members are unsympathetic to these less fortunate
brothers, whom they regard as &quot;hopeless psychotics&quot; or &quot;nuts who aren't
'real' alcoholics at all.&quot; Thus, we see in A.A. two disturbing
tendencies: (1) to define an alcoholic as a person who stays sober in
AA.; and (2) to relegate all other problem drinkers to the limbo of
psychosis.

<p>
AAs are fond of quoting such &quot;statistics&quot; as:
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">Fifty per cent of all
alcoholics coming into AA get sober and remain sober</a>; 25 per cent have
one or two slips, then 'get the program' and maintain sobriety; the
other 25 per cent are either psychotic or not alcoholic at all.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
A question arises:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">
how do A.A. members garner these figures</a>? Because
A.A. considers itself a deliberately permissive fellowship made up of
autonomous groups which do not keep exact records, no real statistics
exist. Nevertheless, individual members advance these generalizations
as incontrovertible truths.

<p>
This kind of misinterpretation has narrowed A.A.'s once flexible
philosophy into exclusive dogma.
</font>

One undesirable effect is that those
alcoholics who are not able to make A.A. work for them lose all hope;
they fear that nothing is left for them except insanity (Korsakoffs
Syndrome or the dreaded &quot;wet brain&quot;) or death. This is not so. Many
alcoholics achieve a sobriety made happy and creative through medical,
psychiatric, psychological, and pastoral techniques. The
sometimes-tragic misunderstanding &#8212; that only AA can help &#8212; is fostered
by A.A.'s growing rigidity.

<p>
<font color="blue">
If A.A.'s intolerance were confined to its own community, we could
&quot;live and let live,&quot; as it exhorts its members to do. But A.A.s are
indefatigable crusaders who greatly influence the national crusade
against alcoholism
</font>
&#8212; a malady which today afflicts five million Americans
and costs taxpayers and industry over a billion dollars annually,
according the National Council on Alcoholism. The Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare has called alcoholism the nation's fourth most
serious public-health problem, ranking in importance with heart
disease, cancer, and mental illness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
AAs hold key positions in city, state, and private agencies dealing
with alcoholism. Many executive directors of local committees and
information centers are members of AA. This means that public education
on alcoholism is almost entirely in the hands of AAs. Furthermore,
nearly all information about research, treatment, and community action
is disseminated by public-relations directors who adhere to the A.A.
party line. Thus, almost everything we read on alcoholism in newspapers
and magazines is A.A. propaganda.

<p>
Zealous members spread this propaganda, not for personal gain, but to
&quot;flush out&quot; alcoholics and help them share their own dubious serenity.
</font>

<p>
I have had the unnerving experience of hearing a spontaneous remark
made by an AA speaker in New York on a Monday repeated as gospel in
Chicago on the following Friday. Much worse, I have heard a federal
department chief publicly parrot a &quot;statistic&quot; I knew had been invented
by an A.A. the week before. It is perhaps no coincidence that the A.A.
publication is known as &quot;The Grapevine.&quot;

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Alcoholics Anonymous is hostile to criticism from any source. &quot;All we
ask is to be left alone,&quot; they cry. But they do not leave the American
public alone.
</font>
<font color="blue">
They influence public-health officials; they write
extensively; they take positions on medical subjects such as diet and
drugs (tranquilizers, sedatives, and stimulants all fall under the
rubric of &quot;goof-balls&quot; to AA), and hold themselves up as final arbiters
on any matter pertaining to alcoholism.
</font>

<p>
One result of this authoritarianism is that well-meaning laymen
organize committees and sponsor &quot;research'' &#8212; which leads qualified
professionals to assume that the job of fighting alcoholism is getting
done. But it isn't &#8212; largely because of a basic fallacy in A.A. thinking:
that it takes an alcoholic to understand an alcoholic. The trouble lies
in defining the word &quot;understanding.&quot; Scientists agree that alcoholics
are more empathetic to other alcoholics than anyone else; but when they
venture the opinion that trained specialists might be better equipped
to conduct formal treatment and research than untrained alcoholics,
they run into a storm of protest.

<p>
<font color="blue">
AAs seem almost afraid that
<a href="orange-coffee.html">science will come up with a &quot;cure&quot;</a>
(an absolutely taboo word in the A.A.
lexicon) and render A.A. unnecessary.

<p>
&quot;What will we do if someone discovers a pill that cures alcoholism?
It's our dedication that's keeping us sober and serene!&quot;
the executive-director of an influential agency on alcoholism recently said to me.
</font>

<p>
Needless to say, this person and most of this agency's staff are
practicing members of AA. All are dedicated to combating alcoholism.
But just as sobriety is a vocation for many A.A.s, for many agency
people it is a career.

<p>
<b>SOBRIETY . . . NOT SLAVERY</b>

<p>
Another dangerous aspect of A.A. as a religious cult is the concept of
sobriety as the ultimate goal of life.
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#sobriety">The very word &quot;sobriety&quot; has
taken on a religious flavor</a>
and is uttered with hushed awe, rather than
spoken of as a condition necessary to health and happiness. Practically
all members who have passed the pigeon, or novice, stage
<font color="#9F0000">speak of the quality of so-and-so's sobriety, as if
evaluating degrees of spirituality</font>.

<p>
Sobriety has, indeed, become the A.A.'s end which justifies any means.
I know men whose wives work and support them so that they may devote
their full time to &quot;A.A. Work.&quot; I have talked with these women at
Al-Anon meetings (groups formed especially for the spouses of
alcoholics). Most are not complaining about their lot as A.A. wives;
they insist that anything is better than living with a practicing
alcoholic.
<font color="blue">
But other women confess that eating, sleeping, and talking
A.A. twenty-four hours a day is almost worse than having an alcoholic
husband.
</font>
The masculine point of view was summed up by a legendary souse
at a bar who indignantly denied that he was an alcoholic. &quot;I'm no
blankety-blank alcoholic,&quot; he shouted, &quot;I'm a drunk!&quot; When asked about
the difference he retorted, &quot;Alcoholics have to go to those
blankety-blank meetings all the time!&quot;

<p>
I have heard husbands of alcoholics complain that A.A. has become a
network of women's auxiliaries devoted to gossip and the &quot;chanting of
A.A. litanies such as, There but for the Grace of God.. . '; 'Easy does
it'; and 'Living one day at a time.&quot;'

<p>
A.A. dogmatism has prevented many people from seeking a more moderate
solution: sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous without slavery to it.

<p>
And there are still other possibilities such as psychotherapy or
pastoral counseling. But AAs would probably retort, justifiably, that
they'll stick to what they've got until something better comes along.
Many alcoholics who come to A.A. have had unhappy experiences with
psychologists or psychiatrists. Some therapists follow their own party
lines, usually Freudian, too strictly and write off alcoholism as &quot;just
a symptom of some underlying emotional disorder&quot; &#8212; implying that once
the disorder is uncovered the problem of alcoholism will automatically
be solved. Too many alcoholics are worsened by this oversimplified
approach. Many others instinctively know better, especially when
psychoanalysts begin probing their Oedipal Situations. However, most
psychotherapists now understand that alcoholism is a complex, distinct
illness and must be treated accordingly.

<p>
<b>&quot; ARRESTED&quot; OR &quot;RECOVERED&quot;</b>

<p>
But AAs veer to the other extreme. They assert vehemently that there's
nothing wrong with alcoholics except alcohol, and all the alcoholic has
to do is to stay away from that first drink. (There is a standard gag
in A.A. about the alcoholic who always orders two drinks and only
drinks the second one.) The facts are: (1) the alcoholic obviously
wouldn't be an alcoholic if it weren't for alcohol (what would he be?)
and he certainly must abstain from it if he is to get well; but (2) he
undoubtedly is suffering from some sort of psychological disorder:
emotional, mental, or social. Unfortunately, &quot;psychology&quot; is a synonym
for &quot;psychosis&quot; to most A.A.s. When a recent Ph.D. dissertation on
alcoholism was published in popular book form (<i>Seven Sinners</i>, by Arthur
King, Harcourt, Brace and World, 1961), A.A.s immediately took the
author to task for suggesting that alcoholics could be placed in
categories of psychopathology like any other victims of a behavior
disorder: the manic-depressive or compulsive-obsessive cases, for
example, complicated by uncontrolled drinking. &quot;What was the big idea of
saying alcoholics were a bunch of nuts,&quot; A.A.s demanded.
<font color="blue">
Yet, they insist that &quot;alcoholism is a disease.
</font>
The President of the National Council of Alcoholism, an exceptional executive with a scientific mind,
goes further, calling alcoholism a respectable disease. It can happen
to anyone, he implies, and should not have social or moral stigma
attached to it. I couldn't agree more heartily.

<p>
But AAs prefer to regard alcoholism as a purely physical disease:
organic, glandular, metabolic, dietary &#8212; anything but mental. The only
time this dread word is used is in an AA. definition of alcoholism: &quot;A
physical allergy, coupled with a mental compulsion.&quot;

<p>
According to the American Medical Association (Journal of the American
Medical Association, May 25, 1957), &quot;alcoholism can be classified into
(1) primary alcoholism, which includes (a) those patients who from the
very first drink of an alcoholic beverage are unable to control their
desire for it and (b) those who through use over a great many years
have developed an inability to take a drink or leave it alone and have
become like group (a); and (2) secondary alcoholism, which includes
those who use alcohol for its sedative action as a means of escape from
reality and, in particular, from their personal problems. . . . This
secondary group comprises by far the majority of patients suffering
from alcoholism; however, most alcoholic patients prefer to be in the
primary group.&quot; (Emphasis mine.)

<p>
By refusing to take into account problems of mental confusion,
emotional immaturity, and social maladjustment, A.A.s are seriously
hindering not only their own recovery, but scientific research as well.

<p>
If AAs are to be rescued from fanaticism, they must thoroughly
understand two crucial words &#8212; &quot;arrested&quot; and &quot;recovered.&quot; These are
terms used to describe alcoholics who do not drink any more. Most
members of A.A. fall into the former category; that is, they have
arrested the development of their disease and have learned to live with
it. To these men and women, alcoholism is something real in itself,
like an incurable cancer. &quot;Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic&quot; is
one of A.A.'s most holy doctrines. They mean that once a person has
lost control of his drinking he will never again be able to drink
normally, even to the extent of one glass of beer. He must work
regularly at the business of not taking that first drink.

<p>
This means he must practice A.A. in all his affairs; attend meetings
without fail; do &quot;Twelfth Step Work&quot; (the analogy between A.A.'s
&quot;Twelve Steps&quot; and the Ten Commandments is unmistakable); and proselyte
other alcoholics into Alcoholics Anonymous. If he doesn't live AA.,
he's sunk. He gets drunk again sooner or later and &#8212; alcoholism being in
the dogma of AA a progressive disease &#8212; he'll be worse off than ever.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is true, of course, that the drinking alcoholic becomes worse and
worse in his drinking behavior. But what A.A. does is to superimpose
this concept on the behavior of the non-drinking alcoholic. According
to A.A., the disease itself progresses. This is erroneous thinking. An
alcoholic who relapses after a period of abstinence may very well get
sicker than ever, but because he has aged, not because his alcoholism
has &quot;progressed.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The term &quot;recovered&quot; means something different: it implies that the
patient's alcoholism is no longer a problem. He may not be able to
drink normally again, although some investigators such as D. L. Davies,
Dean of the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital, London,
believe there are many such cases. This hospital's work has been
conscientiously reported by the <i>Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol</i>
(at the Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies; &quot;Normal Drinking in
Recovered Alcohol Addicts&quot;' March 1962). Here is an excellent example
of the true scientific method, for the <i>Quarterly Journal</i> reports both
fact and theory.
<font color="blue">
It is not surprising that Dr. Davies' article has been
either ignored by A.A., or brushed off with typical illogic:
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman">Well, if
these people drink normally, then they couldn't have been alcoholics in
the first place</a>.&quot;
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
No AAs I queried had actually read the piece, though
all were firm in their denunciation of it.
</font>
<font color="blue">
I have heard A.A.s say that
the report was immoral on the grounds that they might be tempted to
drink again after hearing of it. Scientific truth was of no consequence.
</font>

<p>
The expression &quot;recovered alcoholic&quot; means that the patient no longer
has to treat himself or take treatment from others at least twice a
week for the rest of his life. He accepts life without alcohol; he
makes certain adjustments within himself and in his attitude toward
society; and he gets back into the mainstream of life. He might devote
part of his time to helping alcoholics or others-probably he does &#8212; but
because he can and wants to, not as a device to keep himself sober.

<p>
<b>TRY A.A. FIRST, BUT...</b>

<p>
There are many such recovered alcoholics, both in and out of Alcoholics
Anonymous. These men and women have learned one thing: neither A.A. nor
psychotherapy, nor any other treatment is more than a bridge between
alcoholism and real recovery. Good bridges, perhaps. I still believe
that A.A. provides the best possible way, at present, for most
alcoholics to get sober and start a new life without alcohol. Others
need some form of psychotherapy and/or pastoral counseling &#8212; perhaps in
conjunction with A.A. These disciplines are especially helpful to
people who cannot, without professional guidance, sincerely practice
certain of A.A.'s Twelve Steps, such as Step Four &#8212; &quot;Make a Searching
and Fearless Inventory of Ourselves&quot;; or Step Ten &#8212; &quot;Continue to Take
Personal Inventory and When We Are Wrong Promptly Admit It&quot;; or those
Steps that refer to &quot;a Power greater than ourselves.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a sustaining Way of Life. Sobriety can
never be a satisfactory ultimate goal; it is, after all, merely the
absence of intoxication. It is what one does with one's sobriety that
is important. AA. is a man-made means for attaining this sobriety.
</font>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous should not be a cult for the retardation of the
&quot;arrested&quot; alcoholic. I do not suggest for a moment that a single A.A.
quit the fellowship. On the contrary, I strongly urge sticking with it.
To anyone who is having trouble with alcohol I say: try A.A. first;
it's the answer for most people.

<p>
But to those who insist upon serving A.A. as if it were a holy and
apostolic church, I say, Beware. Observe those members who seem
genuinely serene. Talk with those who have been in A.A. a long time and
who really practice &quot;live and let live.&quot; Though A.A. is an important
part of their lives, it is an adjunct, not the whole. They have crossed
the bridge from arrested alcoholism to true recovery.

<p>
And if even then they cannot stay sober and happy, they should not
despair. There are other ways, other bridges &#8212; physicians and
psychiatrists, psychologists and pastoral counselors, who are capable
and anxious to help them. Some specialize in helping alcoholics who
have conscientiously tried A.A. and failed. Most agree that there's no
such person as a hopeless alcoholic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. as a group must recognize its real function: to serve as a bridge
from the hospital or the jail to the church &#8212; or to a sustaining
personal belief that life is worthwhile. It must not pose as a
spiritual movement that provides everything the alcoholic needs to
fulfill his destiny. It must not teach its young (as it does in
Alateen, its Sunday School for the children of alcoholics) such
catechisms as:

<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;We will always be grateful to Alateen for giving us a
way of life and a wonderful healthy program to live by and enjoy.&quot;
</font>

It must realize that &quot;the actual coffee pot Anne used to make the first
A.A. coffee&quot; (shown in &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Come of Age,&quot; Harper 1957,
a commentary on the A.A. bible, Alcoholics Anonymous, Works Publishing
Company, 1946) is not the Holy Grail. The cake and coffee served after
meetings are just refreshments, not the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
</font>

<p>
Only then will Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;come of age.&quot; Then, perhaps, more
of its members will become &quot;recovered&quot; instead of &quot;arrested&quot;
alcoholics. Science may then be stimulated to further research. And
those alcoholics who are unable to make A.A. work for them may look
elsewhere and find their serenity, too.

<h2>ALCOHOLICS CAN BE CURED &#8212; DESPITE A.A.</h2>
<h3>By Dr. Arthur H. Cain</h3>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<i>An expert charges that Alcoholics anonymous has become a dogmatic cult<br>
that blocks medical progress and hampers many members' lives.</i>
</center>

<p>
It is time we made a thorough investigation of Alcoholics
Anonymous in the interest of our public health. A.A. is
identified in the public mind as a God-fearing fellowship of
350,000 &quot;arrested alcoholics&quot; who keep one another
sober and rescue others from the horrors of alcoholism.
Unfortunately, A.A. has become a dogmatic cult whose chapters too
often turn sobriety into slavery to A.A. Because of its narrow
outlook, Alcoholics Anonymous prevents thousands from ever being
cured. Moreover A.A has retarded scientific research into one of
America's most serious health problems.

<p>
My own experience with A.A. began in 1947. As a psychologist
and investigator into the causes and cure of uncontrolled
drinking, I have attended about 500 A.A. meetings in over 40
states and a dozen foreign countries. At first I was tremendously
impressed with A.A.'s altruistic efforts in alcoholics' behalf.
Its members would perform prodigies of selfless service, no
matter what the hour by meeting the helpless and sodden in
hospitals, flophouses and homes, and offering their sympathy, a
helping hand, and their own example that temptation could be
withstood. At the weekly meetings, which all A.A. members
attended, there was a true sense of humility and a devout belief
in God (We &quot;came to believe that a Power greater than
ourselves could restore us to sanity&quot;) and the fellowship of
man &#8212; the original tenets of A.A. New members were given the
freedom to question A.A.'s guiding principles codified in the
Twelve Traditions and the Twelve Steps of Recovery.'

<p>
Over the years a disturbing change began to take place. As an
increasing number of alcoholics joined A.A. chapters, many turned
out to be misfits who had rejected Christianity, Judaism or the
Kiwanis Club. Dogmatic and opinionated in their nonbeliefs, they
found in A.A. an instrument for a new kind of bigotry. Their only
meaning in life was that they had heroically become
&quot;arrested&quot; alcoholics. Arrogant egoists, they soon
dominated many of A.A.'s 10,000 chapters. Weekly meetings, once
spontaneous and exciting, became formalized and ritualistic.
Anyone who questioned A.A.'s principles or even expressed
curiosity was handed the slogan, <i>Utilize, Don't Analyze</i>, and told
to sit down. The desire to help others degenerated. As one
disheartened former A.A. member told me, &quot;I felt nobody
cared what happened to Mary W. I felt they were just interested
in another alcoholic who would become another notch in their
belts. I felt as if I was being pressed into serving their cause
and building up their oligarchy.&quot;

<p>
With this growing dogmatism came a Dark Ages attitude toward
any scientist who might differ with official A.A. doctrine.
According to the A.A. litany, alcoholism is a physical disease
which can never be cured: &quot;Once an alcoholic, always an
alcoholic.&quot; The corollary is: &quot;A reformed alcoholic
must live A.A. from day to day and never leave A.A.&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue"> 
Actually, there is no scientific evidence that alcoholism is
an incurable, physical disease. According to current evidence,
the origin of uncontrolled drinking is psychological. A person
drinks to ease anxiety, depression, boredom, guilt, timidity,
inarticulateness. An alcoholic learns to become one; he is
not born that way.
</font>
This means that many alcoholics can return to
normal drinking without fear of ending up on Skid Row. Over the
past 17 years I have treated more than 50 alcoholics who no
longer need to attend meetings or receive treatment. Most
important, over 20 of my patients have learned to drink normally,
to use alcohol as a beverage, not a psychological crutch.
<p>
 
Yet when scientists have reported similar findings, A.A.
members have often set out to discredit them.
<font color="blue">
In 1957 Doctors Melvin L. Selzer and William Holloway of the University of
Michigan came up with the then startling report that 13 confirmed
alcoholics had become social drinkers. Because of the pressure of
an influential A.A. member, the state agency that provided the
funds for the study virtually ordered the two scientists to omit
what it called these &quot;embarrassing&quot; findings.
</font>
Doctor Selzer published his findings anyway.
<p>
 
In 1962 Dr. D.L. Davies, after a study at Maudsley Hospital in
London, declared that seven men who had been alcoholics were able
to drink normally after treatment, some had been drinking without
problems for as long as 11 years. Doctor Davies concluded that
'the generally accepted view that no alcohol addict can ever
again drink normally should be modified.&quot;

<font color="blue">
Some A.A. members
branded the scientist's report &quot;immoral, because it might
cause some members to drink.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Dr. E. M. Jellinek, a cofounder of the Yale School of Alcohol
Studies and a dean of researchers in the field of alcoholism
until his death in 1963, was drawing on his own experience when
he declared:
<font color="blue">
&quot; ... Alcoholics Anonymous have naturally
created the picture of alcoholism in their own image ... and
there is every reason why the student of alcoholism should
emancipate himself from accepting this exclusiveness as
propounded by A.A.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Not only has A.A. interfered with scientific investigations,
it has prevented medical and psychological treatment which runs
counter to its own theories.
</font>

At one New York City hospital, for
instance, the physicians preferred using paraldehyde to treat
acute intoxication. But then A.A. members implied that they would
stop referring patients there if paraldehyde was used. The
doctors were persuaded to switch to another drug, chloral
hydrate. As the physician in charge of the alcoholics' ward
explained, the A.A. non-scientists had discovered that
paraldehyde was a form of alcohol. Actually, chloral hydrate is
the more toxic drug. In fact, its indiscriminate use in another
New York hospital has left some patients more intoxicated upon
discharge than when they were admitted.
<p>
 
While A.A. adherents battle scientific inquiry that does not
fit A.A.'s narrow theories, its chapters often attempt to assume
control of members' lives. Purporting to offer everything needed
for human fulfillment, the fellowship now boasts of a
&quot;ladies auxiliary,&quot; called Al-Anon, for spouses of
members and even a division for members' children called Alateen.
It suggests that the youngsters open their meetings by reciting
this incantation: &quot;We will always be grateful to Alateen for
giving us a Way of Life and a wonderful, healthy program to live
by and enjoy!&quot;
<font color="blue"> 
Implied is the distressing theory that there
is no other way of life for alcoholics except that of A.A. &#8212; a
life in which every waking hour is devoted to the struggle for
sobriety.
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
The wife of a Texas member described some unfortunate
consequences of A.A.'s creed that the struggle against alcohol
must be the most important ambition in a member's life.
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;This must be placed above wives or husbands, children
homes, or jobs. They must be ready to abandon these things at any
time....
</font>

The tragic part is, some of them while searching for
this sobriety and serenity actually do exactly that.&quot;
</font>

How pervasive the obsession with A.A. can become was poignantly
demonstrated by a patient who had come to me because of
worries about her A.A. husband. He had proposed that they move
their bed into the A.A. clubhouse so they might be
&quot;available 24 hours a day just in case an alcoholic wandered
in.&quot;
<p>
 
For many members, of course, staying sober is a fierce
challenge daily. But under the A.A. program, the lives of many
are so sterile that their growth as human beings is hindered.
Taught to rely on slogans and compulsive A.A. routine, some are
unable to face the fact that they are alcoholics because they are
psychologically sick. It is for this reason that many A.A.
members never recover.
<p>
 
A New Hampshire novelist and former A.A. member, who has been
continuously sober for eight years, described this human waste
when he wrote me &#8212;
<font color="blue">
&quot;I have met members who are actually
afraid to think. They have made a high fence of A.A., which shuts
them out from all pleasurable and vital aspects of life.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
Behind the A.A. fence the original principle that alcoholics
must be humble before God has been turned into the dictum that
<font color="blue">alcoholics are God's chosen people</font>.
This theme is preached in meetings and through
books and pamphlets. A typical illustration is a booklet titled.
&quot;<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html">Around the Clock With A.A.</a>,&quot;
published recently by an A.A. group in
California.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

One passage declares: &quot;God in His
wisdom selected this group of men and women to be the purveyors
of His goodness.... He went right to the drunkard, the so-called
weakling of the world. Well might He have said to us: 'Unto your
weak and feeble hands I have entrusted power beyond estimate. To
you has been given that which has been denied the most learned of
your fellows. Not to scientists or statesmen, not to wives or
mothers, not even to my priests or ministers have I given this
gift of helping other alcoholics which I entrust to you.&quot;'
Such idolatry causes the believer to see himself as all-knowing,
and turns the missionary into the zealot.
<p>
 
A.A.'s creeds not only infect its own members but pervade
public education.
<font color="blue">
Most of what we hear or read about alcoholism
is inspired by A.A. adherents spouting A.A. dogmas. City, state
and private agencies frequently fill all key posts with A.A.
members.</font>
One western state actually requires that personnel
assigned to its alcoholism program be A.A. members for at least
two years. No professional experience is needed. The A.A.
philosophy also dominates the National Council on Alcoholism, the
only nationwide public-information agency on alcoholism. N.C.A.,
which is supported by public donations, has over 60 affiliated
information committees scattered throughout the country. Although
both N.C.A. and A.A. deny that they are officially connected,
many members of N.C.A.'s staff and some directors are A.A.
members. A.A. members serve as directors in eight out of ten
N.C.A. information centers in the largest cities in the United
States.
<p>
 
Thus, it is not surprising that N.C.A. continues to parrot the
A.A. line that alcoholism is a &quot;progressive disease for
which there is no known cure, but which can only be
arrested.&quot; Further, N.C.A. in a series of radio and TV
commercials actually stated that the American Medical Association
had declared alcoholism to be a disease, although the A.M.A. has
restricted itself to general statements that the alcoholic is
&quot;sick.&quot; Time and again, I have heard public
figures recite A.A.-N.C.A. myths and propaganda as if
they were gospel.
<p>
 
I once heard Arthur Flemming, former Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, read verbatim a pronouncement on
alcoholism which I knew had been prepared a year earlier by
N.C.A.'s public-relations firm. Flemming offered the now familiar
&quot;statistic&quot; that there are five million alcoholics in
the United States. This figure is based on a study Doctor
Jellinek of Yale conducted 18 years ago in a small community; he
thought he had found that three percent of the population were
alcoholics. N.C.A. applied this percentage to the whole nation.
Doctor Jellinek, a great physiologist but no statistician,
repudiated his own formula in 1956. The five-million figure is
only a guess, for &#8212; no scientific count of alcoholics has
ever been made.
<p>
 
While N.C.A. issues well-intended but sometimes questionable
facts and theories, A.A. officials, when pressed, often hide
behind the famous Tenth Tradition, which states that
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues,
hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public
controversy.&quot; This device enables members of A.A. to make
outrageous assertions which A.A.'s headquarters promptly
disavows when challenged.
<font color="blue">
&quot;Many people I have tried to
help,&quot; said one Chicago member, &quot;have abandoned the program
just because they couldn't take the <i>ex cathedra</i> homilies
on drugs, alcohol, psychiatry, medicine, sociology, biology, to
name a few subjects on which they speak with authority.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<a name="trustees"> </a>
<font color="blue">
Much of A.A.'s failure can be blamed, on a lack of
forward-looking, constructive leadership. Writer Jerome Ellison
recently spent several months as a paid consultant to A.A.
evaluating the fellowship's publications and activities.
At national headquarters in New York City, Ellison declared,
committee politics took up half the working day, and gossip was
venomous. Everybody was an expert, Ellison went on, &quot;with a
cluster of ideas closed to amendment.&quot;
</font>
He related how one
member had submitted to the A.A. monthly bulletin an article
which showed that nearly all southern and a great many northern
A.A. chapters were racially segregated, and that A.A. had failed
to keep pace with the growing, problem of Negro alcoholism. The
article was turned down on the ground that it
&quot;<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad1">might disrupt A.A. unity</a>.&quot;
<p>
 
<font color="blue">
Ellison's most damning indictment concerned the rule made by
A.A.'s nonalcoholic board of trustees that no change can be made
in A.A.'s theories on alcoholism, even though they are nearly a
quarter of a century old.
</font>
&quot;Despite the fact that the rank
and file teems with exciting, relevant, informed and
up-to-the-minute experience,&quot; Ellison declared, &quot;none
of it is permitted to appear in book form. To publish such
literature, it is felt, would be to risk heresy.&quot;
<p>
 
Needless to say, I do not suggest that A.A. be abolished or
that a single member quit. That A.A. helps many thousands stay
sober is obvious. But Alcoholics Anonymous should return to its
original purpose of being a much-needed first-aid station. The
&quot;arrest&quot; of uncontrolled drinking is the essential
first step in becoming a recovered or cured alcoholic. During
this critical period, the alcoholic needs the sympathy and
understanding that only another alcoholic can give. But after
three months or so, when the shakes have subsided and the cobwebs
are beginning to clear, the recovering alcoholic should go ahead.
<font color="blue">
He should not be taught that he must remain forever crippled and
bound by the paralyzing concept &quot;Once an alcoholic, always
an alcoholic.&quot;
</font>

It is at this point that the patient needs a
different kind of understanding: an objective, dispassionate,
clinical understanding that physicians, psychologists and
pastoral counselors, not A.A. members, are trained to give. Only
after he has undergone a rigorous and lengthy revision of his
personality should he attempt to drink normally again, and then
only if he desires to do so.
<p>
 
After all, sobriety in itself is not a way of life. It is
simply the absence of intoxication. It is what one does with his
sobriety and his life that is important.

In the nineteen-sixties, Dr. Arthur Cain found that the
&quot;Why We Were Chosen By God&quot; screed
had been published recently in California, but he apparently did
not know that it was already quite old &#8212; that it was originally a speech given
by Judge John T. at the Fourth Anniversary of the Chicago Alcoholics
Anonymous Group, on October 5, 1943.
