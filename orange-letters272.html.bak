From:  	&quot;Brian R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: excellent writing<br>

<p>
Sorry, but I just had time to read your reply.
<p>
I have reviewed the references and I don't disagree that a book or set
of books written by religious people seems religious. But in actual
application it simply isn't.
<p>
For one thing, there is no money involved.
<p>
But I want to make clear that criticism is not only good it's
imperative. I simply think making rash conclusions like &quot;kills more
people than it helps&quot; is so hyperbolic that it leaves the realm  of
informed criticism and becomes irresponsible journalism.
<p>
AA is a radically imperfect solution that, like democracy, is simply the
best answer we currently have.
<p>
If you have evidence of AA killing people I'd love to review it and
think about it pragmatically.
<p>
All I can really say is that my family has been transformed in a
positive way since I started practicing the AA principles. My religious
views haven't changed and if anything I'm far more tolerant of differing
views than I have ever been in the past.
<p>
I too have witnessed the oddball zealots that misuse and abuse the
program, but I have found that to be in the minority.
<p>
All the best.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Brian,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
I have to dispute this line:
<font color="black"> &quot;For one thing, there is no money involved.&quot;</font>
<p>
There are immense amounts of money involved. The &quot;recovery industry&quot; is a 20-billion-dollar-per-year
racket, and Alcoholics Anonymous dominates the racket. Plenty of A.A. recruiters make a living
selling the 12-Step cult to the suckers.
And the victims pay anything from $7000 to $40,000 for 28 days of indoctrination in an old pro-Nazi
cult religion from the nineteen-thirties.

<p>
This paragraph is nonsensical, and a prime example of <i>denial</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have reviewed the references and I don't disagree that a book or set
of books written by religious people seems religious. But in actual
application it simply isn't.

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In actual application, Alcoholics Anonymous is a crazy irrational cult religion that expects an
invisible &quot;higher power&quot; to solve all of their problems and tell them what to do
(but only after they confess everything).
<p>
Read this file:
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank"><i>&quot;It's Spiritual, Not Religious&quot;</i></a>

<p>
This line is also an example of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">minimization and denial</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I too have witnessed the oddball zealots that misuse and abuse the
program, but I have found that to be in the minority.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even if only five or ten percent of the A.A. members are crazy fanatics, that is enough to kill
a lot of victims with quackery, especially when they are the oldtimers who act as sponsors and
give instruction to the newcomers.
<p>
And actually, the numbers are far worse than that.
A while back, I ran across a survey on A.A. members' attitudes
towards medications, and it claimed that A.A. members were
not at all dogmatic about medications &#8212; only 17% of the sponsors
were against them. The authors of that article were very pro-A.A.,  and they were
trying to put a smiley-face on the issue, and trying to minimize the problem of
A.A. religious fanatics telling newcomers to quit taking
their doctor-prescribed medications.
<p>
The standard A.A. slogan is:
<font color="black">
&quot;Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;
</font>
<p>
What the writers of the article did not seem
to be able to realize is: that meant that any person with both
a psychiatric and a drug or alcohol problem had a 17% chance of
getting a bad sponsor who just might kill him or her with stupid orders...
<p>
The same goes for people with any other serious medical problems that require medications.
<p>
<font size="-1">
(See: <i>Alcoholics Anonymous and the Use of Medications to Prevent
Relapse: An Anonymous Survey of Member Attitudes</i>. ROBERT G. RYCHTARIK;
GERARD J. CONNORS; KURT H. DERMEN; PAUL R. STASIEWICZ.
Journal of Studies on Alcohol, Jan 2000 v61 i1 p134.)
</font>

<p>
Guess what 17% is equal to? That is almost exactly a one-in-six chance &#8212; the odds in
Russian Roulette.  Would you actually play real Russian Roulette with a Colt 45 six-shooter
that had one bullet in it? Would you advise a friend to?
<p>
Would you go to a medical clinic where you knew that you had a one-in-six chance of getting a quack
doctor who might do you great harm, or even kill you with his stupidity?
<p>
Would you send a patient to a faith-healing cult where you knew they would tell him to stop taking
his medications and just trust God to heal him?

Lastly, you said,

<p>
Actually, A.A. is the worst thing that we have. In repeated clinical tests of A.A., it was found
to be the worst way of treating alcoholics.
<p>
<ol type="A">
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics. People who were sent to
A.A. ended up, after 9 months of A.A., doing FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got no such help, and NINE TIMES as much
binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for drunkenness.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a> that
&quot;free&quot; A.A. just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
made them require more expensive hospitalization later.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
Doctors Orford and Edwards found</a> that just having a doctor talk to alcoholics and their wives for
just one hour, one time ever, telling them to quit drinking or they were going to die, was just as effective as an
entire year of 12-Step-based treatment that included all of the facilities of the hospital.

<p>
<li>
This one is the most damning evidence of all, because it came from a doctor
who loves Alcoholics Anonymous, and is one of its biggest promoters.
He is (or was) also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Inc..
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>
(who later became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
while he tried to prove that A.A. works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based treatment
program had a zero-percent success rate above
normal spontaneous remission, and worse, it had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
At the end of 8 years, the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients
was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
<p>
But 5% per year is the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics &#8212;
what Dr. Vaillant called &quot;the natural history of alcoholism&quot;.
That's how many alcoholics recover on their own, without any &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;support group&quot;. A.A. cannot claim the credit for those
recoveries, no matter whether they attend some A.A. meetings or not,
and Dr. Vaillant clearly said that.  So 5 minus 5 equals zero, the real A.A. recovery rate.

<p>
<li> And then, even though these items have not been surveyed and documented by doctors,
there is plenty of evidence that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">the A.A. suicide rate</a>
 and
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">the A.A. divorce rate</a> are big problems too.

</ol>
<p>
Obviously, we need recovery organizations and methods that do not kill so many patients.



<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

inspiring story of Al-Anon. Discover how cofounders Anne B. and Lois W.
guided the growth of these groundbreaking groups, later known as
Clearing House and, ultimately, Al-Anon. Take an intimate peek into
these visionaries' lives through never-before-published letters provided
by Stepping Stones,
the historical home of Bill W. and Lois W. Listen to recordings
collected by Al-Anon pioneer Arbutus O. See how the program used by the
early &quot;Wives Groups&quot; has evolved over time. Not only will you become a
witness to Al-Anon history, you will find inspiration and insight into
the core principles and practices that have made this a lifesaving
program for thousands worldwide.

Hello again, Ray,

Thanks for the tip. I'll have to check that out. Obviously, it's some fawning, drooling propaganda,
just some more revisionist history.

I just regret that what we get spoon-fed is
so censored and sanitized. I'd like to see the good stuff in those locked and sealed historical
archives that they will never publish, like, &quot;Did Bill Wilson really relapse repeatedly, like every

This is that same family of 5 that you saw a few pictures earlier.
These little guys are nearly grown full-size. The date is July 24, and the babies are already almost as large
as their parents, and you have to look closely to distinguish them from their parents.
They grow so fast that it is unreal. Still, they don't usually mature so early in the summer.
This year there were four pairs of geese who started their broods very early in the spring, so their babies
have gotten big a little ahead of schedule.

A.A. isn't &quot;anyone's choice&quot;. People are sentenced to A.A. every day, and people have A.A.

The scribblings of Bill Wilson do nothing but put alcoholics down and talk about how bad they are.
A.A. claims that they want to remove the stigma of alcoholism, but they actually do just the opposite:

to some extent, in fact, to a considerable extent with some of us.
But we are sure that our bodies were sickened as well.<br>

From:  	&quot;CJ&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA Horror Story<br>

<p>
Hello:

<p>
My name is CJ.  I'm a freelance journalist and short story writer and hopefully my
novel, <i>Good Material</i>, will be getting published soon.  It is an AA horror story.
Your site did a lot to free my mind from the religious indoctrination I was prey to
in AA.
<p>
I was raised by an abusive AA member who, of course, told me I was alcoholic since
before I ever had a drink.  In fact, everyone is an alcoholic in his mind.  He still
tries to tell me my mom is an alcoholic and I never saw her drink.  He claims one
night she jumped out of a car to get away from him because she was drunk.  I'm
guessing it has more to do with the fact that he's got an explosive violent temper
whether he's drunk or sober.
<p>
The fact is, he hides behind his sobriety and never dealt whatsoever with his
multitudinous character defects.  The man is a saint in his eyes just because he
hasn't had a drink in a while (he lies about how long he's been sober for 10-12
years also).
<p>
Anyway, he's an AA nut and my mom is a Jesus freak and between them these two
harmful influences, I believe, set me up to later become a drug addict.  The horror
of it is I that I ended up in AA trying to treat my addictions, a religious program
for people who are often the victims of religion.
<p>
It seems this must often be the case.  People in AA are always saying things like
&quot;This isn't your religion's God&quot; in there and I was informed repeatedly that I had
blocked God out and that was the basis of my problems.
<p>
Well, yes, I became an atheist at 15.  Probably the sanest thing I'd ever done up
until that point.  And, after that, for decades, my mom would tell me, every time
anything went wrong, it was because I didn't have Jesus in my life and my dad would
tell me, every time something went wrong, is was because of drinking.
<p>
Granted, drinking was a factor in many situations that later arose.
<p>
However, joining a nutty cult that tells you your parents did the best they could
and to ignore their effect on you completely and turn yourself into a god-slave just
didn't exactly have the greatest effect on me.
<p>
Furthermore, I developed terrible anxiety and when God couldn't fix it I was
encouraged to just do what my doctor said and take xanax which I developed a
monstruous addiction to.
<p>
I then spent a year and a half weaning myself off xanax and going through
withdrawals (they last that long in some cases).
<p>
So, after years of pain, suffering and idiocy I still went out and drank because I
was so bitter about being bamboozled by AA.  However, I was able to moderate my
drinking, I found out.  I just limited my drinks and didn't take drugs and since
then it's never been a problem.
<p>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
I read on here lots of people are told not to take medications and suffered at the
hands of AA.  I've seen that happen too.  However, in my case, I was encouraged to
take medications and suffered.  My sponsor told me to take the xanax daily everytime
I felt uncomfortable and, if I wasn't programmed to follow his instructions by
everyone telling me in AA &quot;everytime something goes wrong its because you didn't
listen to your sponsor&quot; I would have known better.  In fact, despite the fact I knew
better (I'm a heavy researcher) such was my inculcated fear of relapse and the need
for dependence on AA that I followed his instructions and almost died or went
permanently insane.
<p>
I've actually gone to meetings to talk newcomers out of coming and shoot down
arguments to keep them there in order to protect people from the Cult.  I feel it's
a duty.
<p>
The fact is it hurts my pride I ever fell for the AA bullshit.  But I've forced
myself to admit it to myself.  I figure it's the price of freedom.
<p>
I suspect there are people who never learn how to moderate and need total
abstinence.  But no one needs to have their psyches interfered with by the Cult.

<p>

P.S. 2012.08.23: By the way, CJ, let me give you a belated thanks for being a member in good standing of the
<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">Newcomer Rescue League</a>.
Going to A.A. meetings and warning the newcomers about the bad advice and falsehoods that they
are hearing is a very good thing to do, and may save lives.
<p>
Also, please do not feel guilty or stupid about having been fooled by the A.A. cult for a while.
They are some of the most skilled cult propagandists in the world.
And they had a 75-year head start on you. They have had 75 years of practice in fooling newcomers.
Even more than that, actually, because Bill Wilson and
Doctor Bob just copied all of the mind games and deceptive recruiting techniques of the Oxford Group cult religion.
And Frank Buchman, boss of the Oxford Group, in turn, copied that junk
from his mentor Henry B. Wright of Yale University, who copied his stuff
from others before him.
So they had a couple of centuries of old cult mind games to use on you. You were a defenseless babe
in the woods surrounded by rapid wolves. It was never a fair fight.

Subject:  	Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Hello A. Orange &#8212; 

<p>
I am 47 years abstinent from alcohol.  I consider myself a recovered
alcoholic, and I attribute my beginning recovery to AA.  In general I  learned my
way of life in AA.  I founded an alcoholic recovery home  (in no way
treatment) in 1968 and served as executive director until retirement  in 2000.  I
was a skeptic and iconoclast in the &quot;alcoholism field&quot;  resisting the march
to treatment, including opposing the designation of  alcoholism as a disease
and proclaiming that AA is treatment.  I  believed, and believe, those
designations were misguided at best and a  fraud at worst with potential for
great harm to both persons judged to be  &quot;alcoholic&quot;and to AA as a fellowship.
It was shoveling sand against the  tide.

<p>
I agree with many of your conclusions, and find your papers extensive and
informative and worthy of further study and consideration.  However, two
things bother me: 1) the tone seems personally antagonistic and reactive, way
beyond a professional disagreement and calling AA into question (as to
misuse  and clouded in myth), and 2) I assume &quot;A. Orange&quot; is a pseudonym.

<p>
My questions: a) who are you and what is your background? and b) what is
the basis for your enmity?

<p>
Thank you,<br>

At least not on the pages listed below.

<p>
Still like your stuff Terrance and actually used some of it today when discussing
the 11th
Tradition, but I picked up my copy of <i>Bill W.</i> and skimmed through pages 300-302 and
couldn't
find anything you have quoted below.

<p>
Mike

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within a matter of weeks Bill was on the road, giving out
interviews and pictures. A group would ask him to speak,
he'd get in touch with the chairman, who'd tip off a local
reporter, then after the meeting, they'd talk, and the next
morning &#8212; if the war news didn't preempt him &#8212; he would
find his picture splashed across page one, often with a rousing
account of the number of hopeless drunks he had saved. It was
work that Bill W. thoroughly enjoyed, and in the beginning a
great many groups went along with him. But only in the beginning.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Naturally &#8212; and inevitably, as he would learn &#8212; there were loud
objections. &quot;Who does he think he is?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;What
the hell is he pulling?&quot; and &quot;what about Dr. Bob?&quot;
He wasn't the only superstar, and soon others were trying to
get into the act. And as always, AAs were not shy about expressing
their opinions. Nor was Bill. He could still rationalize his every
action. This was America, he pointed out, and there was a little
thing called free speech here. All organizations, all countries,
were being run by big-name leaders now. Secrecy might be all right
for others, but the public had a right to know who AA's founders
were.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
With that one phrase, &quot;all right for others,&quot; Bill began
to think of himself as an exception. ... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He'd accepted Rollie's challenge and was proving that he
could command as much publicity as a ballplayer. With his old
zest for combat, the Burr and Burton boy was showing them,
showing them all. And besides, no one could deny that in some
towns his promotional schemes were getting results. More drunks
were turning up at meetings after his story appeared.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One night &#8212; and he remembered this because it was the first time
he'd heard the words &#8212; an old-timer told him that he might indeed
be the cofounder, they might owe their lives to him, but he'd better
watch himself because he was sure as hell acting like a man on a
<i>dry drunk</i>.<br>

Hello Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I put a hold on that book at my local library, and just got it.
Alas, I got the paperback edition, the &quot;Popular Library&quot; edition, reprinted 1979.
Previously, years ago, I was reading
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Thomsen" target="_blank">the hardcover 1st edition from 1975</a>, from another library. The page numbers in my notes are from that book.

<p>
I found the quote in the paperback copy
at pages 278 to 280. I don't know whether I just goofed on the page numbers years ago,
or whether the page numbers are different between the hard cover 1st edition and the
later paperback edition.
I'll try to get my hands on a hardcover edition and compare the page numbers.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Thanks for the article, Peter. That's a good one. You are hitting on a very important point there.
I know that the A.A. doctrine that alcoholics must &quot;hit bottom&quot;
has killed a lot of people.
I don't have any exact numbers, but I know it's happening a lot.
I've also gotten a lot of complaints and horror stories myself.
When people are not willing to surrender their lives and their minds to the cult,
the sponsors tell them to &quot;go back out and do some more research on the subject.&quot;

<p>
There ought to be a law.

<p>
I can't help but notice the element of sadism and the power games. Only
those people who &quot;hit bottom&quot; and are &quot;totally defeated
by alcohol&quot; and are willing to obey their superiors in all matters
are &quot;ready for recovery&quot;.
Those people who have any self-will or independence or critical thinking
left supposedly need to suffer some more, until they are broken.
<p>
And many sponsors are more than willing to help them suffer.
<a href="orange-letters11.html#AA_UK" target="newwin98">I got one letter from
a fellow with a drinking problem</a>
whose boss called the A.A. hotline for advice, and the A.A. member on the
other end of the line told the boss to fire his alcoholic employee
so that the guy would hit bottom.
With friends like that, who needs enemies?
That is quite a &quot;self-help group&quot;.
<p>
It also reminds me of <i>The Psychology of the Pawn</i>.
&quot;Pawns&quot; who get defeated seek to bring others down to their level so that they
will have some company. (See Dr. Robert Jay Lifton's writings about
coercive mind control and brainwashing programs.)

<p>
You make an important point when you say that professional &quot;counselors&quot; also try to make
clients &quot;hit bottom&quot;.
And they charge money for that &quot;treatment&quot;?  What a racket.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Yes, or at the very least professionals should be accountable for spewing such
nonsense. Note that the woman I quote in the article mentions pros &#8212; not just 12

Yes, &quot;pros&quot;, as in &quot;professional therapists&quot; and
&quot;professional counselors&quot; or even &quot;doctors&quot;. You
know, that is a heck of a branch of medicine where you can make a good

AA does not receive any money from treatment centers.  The first and second
copy of the big book are out of copyright so they can be downloaded for
free.  Yes AA is a bit more organized than I would like but ALL the leaders
are elected.  There is no Cult leader and only a few positions are paid.
Look everyone is entitled to their point of view I just don't like opinions
dressed up as facts when there are sick people involved. I know I can't stay
sober by myself, I've tried many.many times.

Hello again, Richard,
<p>
I will have to go through that line by line, because nearly every sentence is wrong.

<p>
Baloney. Hazelden is the biggest customer of A.A.W.S., and the biggest distributor of A.A. council-approved
literature. They are very much in bed together.
<p>
And most treatment centers resell A.A. literature. Actually, they charge the customers anything
from $7000 to $40,000 for 28 days of indoctrination in Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion, and
then they &quot;give&quot; the <i>Big Book</i> to the customers.

</font>
<p>
Yes, those editions are out of copyright. But that did not stop A.A.W.S. General Manager Greg Muth
from signing
<a href="grantofauthority.pdf">a document that authorized A.A. suing A.A. members in foreign countries</a>
for giving away
or selling very inexpensively <i>their own translations</i> of the first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>.
In Germany and Sweden, A.A. members were going into prisons and &quot;carrying the message&quot; by giving
away their own prints of the old <i>Big Book</i>. The crooks at the A.A. headquarters
 put a stop to that.

A.A.W.S. representatives committed perjury in the courts of Mexico and Germany to keep a fraudulent
copyright on the first edition. In Germany, they claimed that Bill Wilson wrote the whole <i>Big Book</i>
all by himself. In Mexico, they testified that the <i>Big Book</i> had been written rather recently
by a &quot;Wyne Parks&quot;, so it's still under copyright.

<p>
More baloney. The leaders elect themselves. The guys at the top do not stand election by the rank-and-file
membership, and the membership cannot remove the crooks. A.A. is structured so that a revolution
cannot come up from below. A double majority is required for the membership to change anything.
However, the guys at the top have been rewriting the rules at will, to their advantage.
This has come up before.
<a href="orange-pamphlet2.html" target="_blank">When the general membership censured the leaders
for crimes</a>,
the leaders told the membership to take a long walk off a short pier.
(Check out that link.)

<p>
The leaders at the top, like Greg Muth, really rake in the big bucks.
Greg Muth was taking $250,000 per year, and he gave his friend Thomas Jasper $469,000 as a going-away
present. We discussed all of that before, in many places. Start here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Salaries of A.A. leaders</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters117.html#Lillianna" target="newwin112">Former EDP Manager for A.A.
Lillianna Murphy wrote to me</a>
and said that she didn't get even half of the money that Greg Muth reported on the Form 990.
So somebody else took that money home.

<li> <a href="orange-letters248.html#ANONYMOUS" target="newwin112">More on A.A. headquarters finances</a>,
including copies of all of the recent Form 990 filings.
</ul>

ok everyone is entitled to their point of view I just don't like opinions

</font>
<p>
Now I agree totally with that statement, and that is why I am so opposed to Alcoholics Anonymous.
It is a despicable crime to take
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's old pro-Nazi cult religion</a>
 and foist it
on sick people as if it actually worked as a cure for alcohol addiction, and to falsify reports
and lie about how well it works. That is a really low, vile, crime.
People should be put in prison for that. They have killed a lot of sick people with their quackery.

<p>
Hi;

<p>
I have been reading your scathing condemnation of Alcoholics Anonymous and some
questions come to mind:

<p>
1. What were the major factors that motivated you to do such an in depth analysis?

<p>
2. Were you ever a member of AA and if so, for how long?

<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
3. Arguably, AA has saved millions of lives over the years, what do you recommend
for an alternative?

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to consider these questions. I look forward to your
reply.

<p>
Sincerely

<p>

I went to A.A. meetings intensively for about three months, before I wised up.
I don't know if I was ever a &quot;member&quot;. I think not.
If you have to give your mind and your heart to the cult and declare that you are a member, then
I was never a member. I never drank the koolaid.


<p><li>
Arguably,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">A.A. has never saved any millions</a>.
The claims that A.A. is a great success that has saved millions is just Bill Wilson's bombastic
grandiose lying. (Click on that link.)

Yes, I have many other things that I recommend for helping people to quit their bad habits
and save their lives from addictions.
