<h1>NEW RECOVERY GROUP</h1>
<font size="+2">Recover From Twelve-Step Groups</font><br>
</center>

<p>
We have a new thirteen-step program to help you recover from
the evil influences of too many twelve-step recovery group
meetings:
<p>
1. Admit that you are powerless over twelve-step meetings &#8212; that
your life has become unmanageable. Scream and pass out.
<p>
2. Come to believe that only Santa Claus can restore you to
sanity.
<p>
3. Make a decision to give all of your problems to Santa Claus,
as we understand Him.
<p>
4. Turn your will and your mind over to the care of Santa Claus. 
They were worthless anyway. Also stick him with those pesky
problems.
<p>
5. Make a searching and fearless inventory of your garage. You
won't believe the junk you will find in there.
<p>
6. Confess to everyone that you can't sing, you can't dance, your
butt is too fat, and you have bad breath.
<p>
7. Make yourself entirely ready to have Santa Claus fix those defects.
<p>
8. Write a letter to Santa Claus, humbly begging him to remove all
of your shortcomings.
<p>
9. Make a list of all of the people you have pissed off.
<p>
10. Go piss them off again.
<p>
11. Continue to inventory your garage, and when you find that you
are hoarding some really useless junk, promptly admit it.
<p>
12. Seek, through your cell phone, to maintain constant contact
with Santa Claus, as we understand Him. If you can't get Him,
call a psychic hotline. Do whatever the old witch says.
<p>
13. Make twenty copies of this letter, put your name at the
bottom, and send them to all of your friends.

<center>
<font size="+2">Our New Religion</font><br>
</center>
<p>

Our new religion is called &quot;Ungroupism&quot;&reg;. It
differs from our major competitor, the other cult religion,
Anonymous Alcoholism&reg;, in a number of important ways.
<p>
<ul>
<li> First off, we never have any meetings. Attending meetings
would be very unUngroupistic.
<p>
<li> Also, Ungroupism as such ought never be organized, so it
isn't. There is no national headquarters, nor any state or local
offices, either. If you want to contact the President of
Ungroupism, or the Board of Directors, or the Trustees,
you can't, because there aren't any.
<p>
<li> In addition, we are so anonymous that we don't give out any
of our names, first or last, or even our initials. And since we
never have any meetings, there is no way you can figure out who
we are.
<p>
<li> The only requirement for membership in Ungroupism is a
desire to stop going to lunatic meetings.
<p>
<li> Each ungroup has but one primary purpose &#8212; to carry the
message to the meeting maker who still suffers.
<p>
<li> Our major competitor likes to brag that their religion was
founded by &quot;a Wall Street hustler who helped an Akron rectal
surgeon through his last binge.&quot; Oh yeh? Well our religion
was founded by a psychopathic serial killer who ate his last
victim, so our religion is much better than your religion,
thank you.

<p>
<li> You can join our fellowship, and become a member, any time
you wish, just by saying that you are a member, but we don't. We
are firm believers in the wise alcoholic teachings of our patron
saint, W. C. Fields, who said, &quot;The reason I don't belong to
any clubs is, I would never join a club that would have me as a
member.&quot;
<p>
</ul>
If you don't understand this, it's because you are not
working a strong enough program. Go read the Thirteen Steps
again.

<font size="+2">New Alcoholism Treatment</font><br>
</center>
<p>

We have developed a new treatment modality for alcoholism:
the Cheech'n'Chong Treatment Program. It works like this:
whenever you get cravings for alcohol, you put on a ballerina's
tutu and slippers, and Mickey Mouse ears, just like Cheech and
Chong in the movie <i>&quot;Up in Smoke&quot;</i>.
Then you jump up and
down on one foot, while juggling five tennis balls, and reciting
Shakespeare sonnets. Continue this procedure for as long as the
cravings last.
<p>
RARELY HAS this simple program been known to fail, except
for a few unfortunates who are constitutionally incapable of
being honest with themselves while wearing a tutu.
<p>

It works, if you work it.
<p>
<center><hr width="25%"></center>
<p>
And so does my magical ice cream cure that I just invented: Every
time you get
cravings for alcohol, you just go to Baskin Robbins and eat ice cream
instead of drinking alcohol.
<p>
I particularly recommend the French Vanilla. Definitely avoid the
Rum Raisin.
<p>
This simple program does not and can not ever fail, if you
<i>completely</i> give yourself to it.
RARELY HAVE we seen somebody fail this simple program,
except for a few people who are constitutionally incapable
of being honest with their ice cream.
There are such unfortunates among us.
They seem to have been born that way.

<p>
So <i><b>Keep Coming Back!</b></i> to Baskin Robbins. <b><i>It Works If
You Work It! You Die If You Don't! So Work It, You're Worth It!</i></b>

<center>
<font size="+2">Press Release:<br>
New Faith-Based Treatment for Alcoholism</font><br>
</center>
<p>
Serenity Street, a traditional 12-step residential drug and
alcohol treatment facility, is proud to announce the addition of
Papa Doc Charlie Ngobo of Haiti to the staff, to enhance the
spectrum
of faith-based treatment options available at the center. Papa
Ngobo is a master voodoo witch doctor, who has 30 years of
experience in the practice of spiritual medicine for the
treatment of hexes, evil spells, demonic possession, and
zombification. Papa Ngobo explains that he favors the pointing of
the chicken leg bone for treating alcoholism, combined with the
shaking of an amayomama voodoo rattle, and chanting secret
incantations. And, says Papa Doc, occasionally &quot;You steek dee
acupuncture needles in dee voodoo doll, mon, and eet keep you sober.&quot;
<p>
Papa Doc Ngobo continues, &quot;Rarely, mon, has dees seemple program
been known to fail, except for a few unfortunates, mon, who are
constitutionally eencapable of being honest weeth demselves, mon,
while dey is having duh chicken bones shoved in dey faces.&quot;
<p>
Indeed, the patients are already enthusiastically
recommending the new therapy. Said one, &quot;This new spiritual
program of treating the whole patient, mind, body, and spirit, is
wonderful. Just as soon as we even began to accept the Voodoo
Trinity of Bon Dieu, Legba, and Damballah as our Higher Power, we
commenced to get results.&quot;
<p>
Papa added, &quot;Dee Voodoo program never fails, mon, eet eez dee
eendeeveedual who fails dee Voodoo program.&quot;

<p>
Another patient remarked, &quot;Papa Ngobo has an infallible
method for ending all selfishness and self-seeking immediately. 
When you surrender to the Higher Powers of Bon Dieu, Legba, and
Damballah, you become a mindless zombie without a shred of ego,
self-will or self-centeredness remaining. It's wonderful!&quot;
<p>
And a patient who had been an agnostic said:
&quot;That floored me. It began looking as though
religious people were right after all. My ideas about miracles were
dramatically revised right then.&quot;
<p>
Papa Doc commented, &quot;Dees Voodoo program eez spiritual, not
reeleegious, mon. Eef eet were reeleegious, mon, den I couldn't get
all of dat Medicare and health eensurance money, mon.&quot;
<p>
Papa Doc Ngobo left us with one last piece of advice for handling
cravings, &quot;You steek dee lime in dee coconut, and dreenk eet all
up. You steek dee lime in dee coconut, and call me in dee
morning...&quot;
<p>
Serenity Street is also proud to announce that they have
signed an employment contract with Ms. Helga the Witch, of
Devonshire, England, who will soon be bringing her own special
brand of faith-based, &quot;eye of newt, wing of
bat&quot;, spiritual cures to the clinic.
<p>
Furthermore, Serenity Street is in deep negotiations with a
certain famous Count who resides in Transylvania. This Count is
reported to have had a compulsive drinking problem for centuries,
a problem that he just recently overcame with the help of a
twelve-step therapeutic program. It is hoped that the Count will
soon be another insightful, helpful counselor at the center.

</center>

<p>
...Two days later, a future fellow of Anonymous Alcoholism
stared glassily at the strangers beside his bed. &quot;Who are
you fellows, and why this private room? I was always in a ward
before.&quot;
<p>
They grinned, which he didn't like so much.
Said one of the visitors, &quot;We're giving you a treatment
for alcoholism.&quot;
<p>
Hopelessness was written large on the man's face as he
replied, &quot;Oh, but that's no use. Nothing would fix me. I'm
a goner. The last three times, I got drunk on the way home from
here. I'm afraid to go out the door. I can't understand
it.&quot;
<p>
Asked one of the visitors, &quot;Can you move your right
hand?&quot;
<p>
With a puzzled look on his face, the man tried it, and
discovered that he could.
<p>
Asked one of the visitors, as he offered a glass to the man,
&quot;Can you pick this up with your right hand, and put it to
your mouth?&quot;
<p>
The man tried it. &quot;Why, yes, I can,&quot; said the
man.
<p>
One of the visitors filled the glass with whiskey, and
handed it to the man, and asked, &quot;Can you use your right
hand to lift this glass to your mouth, and drink all of
this?&quot;
<p>
The man discovered that he could.
<p>
One of the visitors filled the glass with whiskey again, and
handed it to the man, and asked, &quot;Can you use your left hand
to lift this glass to your mouth, and drink all of this?&quot;
<p>
The man discovered that he could do that, too.
<p>
Said one of the visitors, &quot;That explains it. That is
what is happening to you on the way home from here. At least one
of your hands is lifting glasses of whiskey to your mouth, and
you are drinking the whiskey. That is why you are getting
drunk.&quot;
<p>
Said the man, &quot;This is amazing. No one has ever been
able to explain it to me so clearly before. I want to join your
church right now.&quot;
<p>
The visitors thought they noticed something different about
him already. He had begun to have a spiritual experience.

This will be a new reality TV show, and it will be great. 
What we will do is take a bunch of wild and crazy guys and gals,
drinking-to-die alcoholics, and put them on an island with more
alcohol than they can possibly drink.
<p>
People will die for real. People will get fed a bunch of
cures for alcoholism that don't actually work &#8212; a bunch of
spiritual stuff and twelve step programs and meetings and all of
that. People will think that the cures will work, and will count
on them, and will bet their lives on them, but they won't really
work.
<p>
It will be an incredibly entertaining show, because we will
be able to watch the people relapse and die drunk, one by one,
right on TV.

<font size="+2">New Treatment Breakthrough</font>
</center>
<p>

Many city, state, and Federal government agencies have been
frustrated by the very poor results obtained from existing drug
and alcohol treatment programs, in spite of the large amounts of
money spent trying to solve these social problems.
<p>
But the Bureau of Abstract Statistics reports a major discovery,
finding that when survey questionnaires about continued drug and
alcohol use are handed out and collected by parole officers,
judges, or other officers of the court, the success rate
of the drug and alcohol treatment programs suddenly jumps to
100%. Nobody reports any problems with relapses or continued use
at all.
<p>
The Bureau suggests that this effect can be used as an
&quot;after-burner&quot; to enhance the success rate of existing
treatment programs. Sam Wannabe, a senior statistician with the
Bureau, says, &quot;It is obvious that we can save the taxpayers
millions of dollars, just by using parole officers and judges to
calculate the success rates of treatment programs.
This is truly a great day in the war on drugs.&quot;

<p><center><br><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p></center><br>

If Workaholics Anonymous people do 90 meetings in 90 days and work a
<i>really strong</i> Program, are they still being compulsive workaholics?
<p>
Shouldn't 180 meetings in 90 days fix the problem?

<p><center><br><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p></center><br>

Alcoholism is a deadly progressive disease.
<p>
And the longer you stay in A.A., the worse it gets.

<p><center><br><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p></center><br>

I saw a T-shirt today that said, &quot;I do what the voices in my
head tell me to do.&quot;
<p>
I laughed.
<p>
And then it occurred to me
that if the T-shirt was being worn by a Buchmanite, or a true-believer
Alcoholics Anonymous member, that it wasn't a joke.

<p><center><br><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p></center><br>

Bill Wilson wrote that you cannot quit drinking by using your
own intelligence and will power; you must have a &quot;Higher
Power&quot; doing the quitting for you.
<p>
When I asked God about that, He said, &quot;Screw Bill Wilson.
I'm not gonna quit drinking.&quot;

<p><center><br><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p></center><br>

In a famous experiment, a therapist hypnotized 1000 alcoholics in
recovery, and suggested to each of them that they had been Carry
Nation, the famous ax-swinging abolitionist, in their previous
lifetime. As a group, they immediately drank less, but
unfortunately, it was because half of them had committed suicide.

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p></center><br>
<center>
<font size="+2">New Spiritual Test</font><br>
</center>
<p>

There is some strange stuff going around: A lot of A.A. and N.A. people
seem to think that the magic of the Twelve Steps will heal anything,
any time, anywhere.
Newcomers are urged to quit taking their doctor-prescribed medications, and
just trust the Twelve Steps to fix their ailments. That assumes
that either the people involved have mind-over-matter powers, or that
God favors these people so much that He will do them a special favor,
and grant a miracle so that the newcomer is instantly healed, and does
not require medications any longer.
<p>
This trust in the Twelve Steps has been abused a lot lately, to the
point that
people suffering from depression have been persuaded to quit taking their
medications, and then they committed suicide. This has happened many times.
There have also been too many other problems with sponsors telling
sponsees to quit other medications, with disastrous medical
consequences.
<p>
In order to prevent any more such tragedies, or abuse of
the sponsor/sponsee relationship, the
General Service Boards of both A.A. and N.A. are sending out the following
directive: <b>&quot;The Magic Qualification Test&quot;</b>.

<p>
The Magic Qualification Test is actually borrowed from Scientology.
In practice, it is very simple: You walk into a room, and there isn't
much in there. Just a table, and a few chairs. And an ashtray on the
table. But you don't leave the room until you levitate the ashtray with
your mind-powers.
<p>
A.A. and N.A. members will use the test in the following manner: Before a
newcomer quits his doctor-prescribed medications, both the sponsor and
the newcomer sponsee will be examined by the group,
and checked to see if they can
pass the Magic Qualification Test. When both have successfully passed
the test, then the group will know for sure that the newcomer and his
sponsor are qualified to use spiritual powers, and only spiritual
powers, to treat medical ailments.

<font size="+2">The A.A. Vanity Game</font><br>

<p>

&quot;God loves me so much that He fixed all of my
problems and took away my desires to drink, or do drugs, or have
illicit sex, or anything. God obviously loves me a whole lot more than
He loves you, because God didn't do that for you, you poor, pathetic
not-very-spiritual piece of dirt.
<p>
&quot;God loves me so much that He even took away all of my self-centeredness,
self-seeking, vanity, and conceit.&quot;

And She really hates the male chauvinist pigism of

When She's in a good mood, she just laughs at it all.

You believe in God. I believe in God, too. But I also believe

So I tried them again, and they didn't work.<br>

My sponsor told me to work an even better program.<br>

So I tried them again, and they didn't work.<br>

Then somebody said, &quot;If you keep on doing what you've
always been doing, you're gonna get what you've always been getting.
To expect anything different is insane.&quot;

a big tankard of inscrutable Japanese Sapporo beer?
<li> I think I have the powerful part figured out: Obviously, Everclear
at 190 proof is much more powerful than beer at four or five percent,
which is only 8 or 10 proof.

<h2>Overcoming the Heartbreak of Truckism</h2>
</center>

Truckism is an incurable, progressive, usually-fatal spiritual disease
that manifests itself in the uncontrollable urge to throw oneself in
front of trucks.
<p>
It often begins in childhood with simple jay-walking, giving in to
the urge to take a shortcut across the street, seeking <i>an easier,
softer way</i>.
<p>

Then it progresses to deliberately stepping in front of cars at crosswalks,
arrogantly insisting that they are required by law to stop for you.
<p>

Finally, truckism grows into an irresistible compulsion to go down to the
freeway and jump in front of fully-loaded, speeding, double-trailer
semi trucks.
<p>
The victim of Truckism is powerless over his urges, and his life has
become unmanageable. Only a spiritual cure can fix this dreaded
spiritual disease.
<p>

The National Association for Truckism, Jay-Walking, and Other
Road-Crossing Disorders (NATJAWORD) has found that the
spiritual 12-step meetings of self-help groups like T.A.
(Truckics Anonymous) can help in the recovery from this terrible
heart-breaking disease.

<p>
As one T.A. member explained, &quot;Recovery isn't easy.
It requires a lot of work, a lot of meetings, a lot of doing the
Twelve Steps, and above all, real rigorous honesty about your total
worthlessness.
But we are here to help, and ready to offer you unconditional love,
whenever you are ready to admit what a pathetic loser you really are.&quot;

Irving Hornbecker, of Cleveland, Ohio, won Saturday's Powerball
lottery, getting all five numbers and the Powerball correct.
He will receive an estimated $32 million.
<p>

Mr. Hornbecker explained that his winning was due to
his A.A. spiritual practices: &quot;All I did was just what Step Eleven
tells me to do, just sit quietly, and meditate, and wait for
God to talk to me and tell me what to do.
Well, God said, 'Irving, play 2-14-29-34-39, Powerball 24!'
And lo and behold, God got the numbers right!&quot;
<p> 
A reporter asked Mr. Hornbecker what he planned to do with the
money. He answered, &quot;Give it all to A.A., of course.&quot;
<p> 
Mr. Hornbecker added,
&quot;I was going to give it to my local group, but they explained
that there is a tradition against anyone giving more than $2000 per
year. But when I called up the national headquarters, they
said that I could send all of the millions that I wanted to, and
that they wouldn't let a silly little tradition about no outside
donations get in the way of progress.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;They said that they had already gotten a hundred thousand from the city
of San Diego for holding the international convention there,
and that it had worked out just fine, with no spiritual rules
broken at all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;They said that they were sure that they could find something nice
to spend tens of millions of dollars on, this time, too.&quot;

Some people have been spreading a nasty rumor about me, saying that I
have switched from worshiping Doorknob Almighty as my Higher Power,
to worshiping Divine Donut. That isn't true at all.
I don't do that.
<p>
I worship the hole in the donut. That's the real Holy Spirit.

There is always an exception to the rule, except for this rule.

Those people are a real bitch to work with. It's nearly impossible
to get them to do the Fourth through Seventh Steps correctly, because
they go and forget all of their sins before they can list and confess them.

How to have fun with recovery:
<ol>
<li> Brag about all of your sober time.
<li> Threaten to relapse if you don't get your own way.
<li> Complain that people who do things you don't like are endangering
your recovery.
<li> Explain that you have to go to a meeting whenever your wife asks you to
do something that you don't want to do, like take out the garbage.
<li> Act like a real ass-hole, and then demand that everyone congratulate
you for not drinking while you did it.
<li> Dump your old wife because she isn't in recovery, and pick up
on that new cutie who is showing up at the meetings.
</ol>

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

If it is really God's Will that we spend our lives in meetings, why weren't
we born with chairs glued to our butts?

<h2>Breeding the &Uuml;bermensch</h2>
</center>
<p>

Anonymous Alcoholism is actually part of a giant secret conspiracy
that involves the CIA, the Trilateral Commission, and the AMA.
It is a eugenics project whose goal is to clean the garbage out of
the shallow end of the gene pool by getting all of the stupid and
gullible people in the country to kill themselves.

<p>
That goal will be accomplished by generously sprinkling the mental
landscape with &quot;I.Q. traps&quot;, things that are like land mines,
but which work on the mental, rather than physical, plane.
The idea is that the smart people will dodge such traps, but the stupid
people will moronically bumble right into one and get eliminated.
<p>
The philosophy behind the &Uuml;bermensch Project is the idea
that anyone who is so
stupid that he can be talked into committing suicide really should
&#8212; he really should be eliminated from the gene pool
to make room for somebody with a few more working brain cells,
and to keep him from making a bunch of children who are as
moronic as he is.
<p>

One spectacularly successful example of an I.Q. trap was the <i>Heaven's
Gate</i> project. There, a bunch of unbelievably gullible web-heads were
actually talked into committing suicide so that they could <i>&quot;hitch
a ride on an invisible flying saucer that was hiding behind a comet,
and go to Heaven&quot;</i>!
<p>
The boys in the Creative Concepts department nearly died laughing when
their suggestion actually worked. They had never expected it to.
They had proposed the <i>Heaven's Gate</i> project as just an
outrageous joke,
one dreary rainy afternoon when they were bored with having no real
work to do. Now their new department motto is:
<p>

<b>Some People Will Believe Anything.</b>

</font>
</center>
</font></td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>
Another example of an I.Q. trap, one that we take a little more
seriously, is the Anonymous Alcoholism practice of teaching people
that they are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; and incapable of
controlling their own drinking.

A.A. teaches their intellectually-challenged members that if they
even <i>just feel like having a drink</i>, they will &quot;get
triggered&quot; and mentally blank out, and start drinking, and spin
totally out of control, and be completely unable to stop drinking.
<p>

Since the people who go to A.A. are people who already have a drinking
problem, the results are predictable:

Those people who are gullible enough to believe the &quot;powerless
over alcohol&quot; doctrine will go on wild drunken binges and die,
hopefully before they reproduce, which will very conveniently wipe
out their idiot genes.
<p>

So far, our eugenics experiment is working well. We can confidently
predict a net five-point increase in the average I.Q. of all Americans
by the year 2300, and ten points by 2500. We foresee, however, that
the increase in the average intelligence of Americans will eventually
render the simpler, stupider, I.Q. traps ineffective. Nobody will
get fooled by them anymore.
In the long run, we will need much smarter, much more
sophisticated I.Q. traps than the ones that projects like A.A.
are giving us now. We are working on that problem.
<p>

In addition, the increase in the average intelligence of Americans will
also cause great difficulties for the politicians, who won't
be able to fool people so easily any more.
We have examined and debated various solutions to that problem, but have
not found any easy answers. We have
decided, for the time being at least, to do nothing.
We are temporarily adopting a strategy of &quot;Let the politicians
fend for themselves. They will have to grow smarter, too.&quot;

Bill said,
<b>&quot;When A.A. was quite young, a number of eminent psychologists and doctors
made an exhaustive study of a good-sized group of so-called problem
drinkers. The doctors weren't trying to find how different we were
from one another; they sought to find whatever personality traits, if
any, this group of alcoholics had in common. They finally came up with
a conclusion that shocked the A.A. members of that time.
These distinguished men had the nerve to say that most of the alcoholics
under investigation were still childish, emotionally sensitive,
and grandiose.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;How we alcoholics did resent that verdict!&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>12X12</i> pp 122-3)</font>
<p>

&quot;I'm happy to say that I didn't have those particular defects
of character myself, but the rest of the alcoholics around here were
real messes, and had a very hard time accepting that fact. They were
really in denial about it.&quot;
<p>

<b>&quot;Even so has God restored us all to our right minds.&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>BB</i> p 57)</font><br>

<b>&quot;The power of God goes deep!&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>BB</i> p 114)</font>
<p>

&quot;So everything is wonderful now. All it took was Doing The Twelve
Steps, wallowing in guilt and grovelling before God until we wore
holes in the knees of our pants, confessing tons of sins, and Seeking
and Doing the Will of God until we were sick of it. Still, the
<i>'God Is My Shrink'</i> program is great, and a whole lot cheaper
than paying a real psychiatrist.&quot;
<p>

&quot;The results are fantastic:&quot;<br>

<b>&quot;We get treated by the Great Physician,&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>BB</i> p 351)</font>
<b>&quot;Him who has all knowledge and power.&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>BB</i> p 85)</font><br>

<b>&quot;We come to regard ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of God's
ever advancing Creation.&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>BB</i> p 49)</font><br>

<b>&quot;We feel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with
the Spirit of the Universe.&quot;</b>
<font size="-1">(<i>BB</i> p 75)</font>

&quot;Still, I sure am glad I wasn't one of those grandiose alcoholics.&quot;

The answer is simple:
<p>

He looked it over, and then told me, &quot;I can fix it, but only

I said that I didn't understand what he meant.
<p>
He said that it was necessary for me to believe in electronics,
and to believe that the fix would work, in order for it to work.
<p>
I told him, &quot;Well, yeh, I guess I believe it will work, if
you fix it right.&quot;
<p>
He said, &quot;No, no, no! That isn't good enough. You have to
<i><b>really</b></i> believe that it will work.&quot;
He fixed me with a steely glare and got right in my face.
&quot;You must <i><b>totally</b></i> believe in electronics.
You must rid yourself of all doubts.
You must abandon logic and Reason and human intelligence.
You must have faith, and <b><i>completely</i> give yourself</b> to this

Jesus Christ has been declared <i>persona non grata</i> and
banned from the local Anonymous Alcoholism clubhouse, informed
sources say. &quot;Well, that joker was always zapping people's
water or coffee, and turning it into wine, and getting them drunk.
We just couldn't have that. We know that traditionally the only
requirement for membership in A.A. is a desire to quit drinking,
but Jesus's behavior was simply not acceptable here.&quot;
<p>
When asked if he thought they would get into trouble for banning
Jesus, an anonymous spokesperson said, &quot;No, I don't think we
will have any problems with it. Besides, most of us here pray to
a bedpan or a doorknob as our Higher Power anyway, so Jesus won't really
be missed.&quot;

At Charlie Towns' hospital in New York City in 1934,
Doctor William D. Silkworth gave alcoholics the magical
&quot;belladonna cure&quot;, a drug cocktail whose main ingredient was the
hallucinogenic drug belladonna. Bill Wilson went to that hospital and got that
treatment for alcoholism four times in a little more than a year, the last
one being in December of 1934.
<p>
Most of the hard-core old alcoholics also suffered from <i>delirium tremens</i>,
which also causes people to hallucinate, so they had quite a variety of
&quot;visions&quot; while detoxing.
After a group of such alcoholics had been detoxed, Dr. Silkworth examined
them and questioned them,
to determine the nature of their experiences.

<p>
&quot;Joe, what did you see? Silkworth asked.
<p>
&quot;I saw pink elephants with purple polka dots, and they were flying through the air
and trumpeting with their big trunks and laughing,&quot; Joe answered.
<p>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Silkworth said. &quot;That was just a hallucination.
What about you, Fred?&quot;
<p>
&quot;I saw bugs. There were millions of bugs, cockroaches and beetles and centipedes,
crawling all over the walls and floors, and then they crawled up my legs and were
all over me. I was screaming for them to get off, but they wouldn't.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Silkworth said. &quot;That was just a hallucination.
What about you, Bill Wilson?&quot;
<p>
&quot;I saw God. There was a big white flash and then I felt like I was
on a mountain-top, with a wind of spirit blowing through me.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Dr. Silkworth, &quot;I can certify that as
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#genuine_experience">a genuine spiritual experience</a>.
And I can assure you that you were not hallucinating.
I feel humbled, just to be in your magnificent presence, Bill Wilson.&quot;

I am all for teaching the theory of Intelligent Design in high school science classrooms,
right alongside the theory of Evolution and the Theory of Gravity and the
Round Earth theory and other such &quot;scientific&quot; theories.
I think that all theories should get equal time, no matter where they come from
or who says them, and the spiritual theories certainly must not be neglected.
<p>
One time-honored old spiritual theory that really must be taught to
children is <i>The Witchcraft Theory of Diseases</i>.
This theory says that diseases are not caused by silly invisible things
that you can't even see, like viruses or bacteria; diseases are caused
by witches casting evil spells and putting nasty hexes on people.
<i>(You can see the witch, can't you? YES!)</i>

<p>
When your children get sick, it is because that ugly old lady next door
put a hex on them. Obviously. And the only cure is to burn that witch at the stake.
<p>
And the proof of the theory is, when your children get sick with
chicken pox or mumps or measles, just burn that old lady to a crisp,
and then just see how soon your children get better after that.
<p>
Such an obviously correct theory must be taught in high school science
classes right along with the Intelligent Design Theory and the Flat-Earth Theory
and the Hollow-Earth Theory.

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

And in addition to the Intelligent Design theory, there is the Drunken Design theory:
<p>
God says,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
&quot;Look, I was drunk on my ass when I designed the Physical Universe. It was just a
joke, a lark. I was at a party, and we were just messing around.
Don't take it so seriously; it doesn't mean anything.
<p>
&quot;I mean, especially, haven't you looked at quantum physics?
Don't any of you have the brains to notice that it is all totally goofy,
flat-out crazy?
<p>&quot;Particles dematerialize in one place and rematerialize in another place without going
through the space in between?
<p>&quot;Particles exist only as clouds of probabilities until they suddenly become
real, no matter how improbable that may be?
<p>&quot;And that tiny world is populated by quarks &#8212; charming quarks, fuzzy
quarks, and strange quarks?
<p>&quot;Don't you get it?
<p>&quot;Don't you think we were laughing our heads off when we made up that nonsense?
<p>&quot;It was a good party.&quot;

If Jesus died for my picayune little sins, then he really got taken
advantage of in a bad business deal.
<p>
(I thought those Jewish guys were supposed to
have a reputation for being sharp businessmen and good hagglers...)
<p>
I mean, a human sacrifice just wasn't necessary for me.
I'm sure that crabby old Jahweh could have been appeased for my sins
with just the sacrifice of a few chickens and goats.

I joined Blabbermouths Anonymous, and I was really doing well in the program,
until I realized that it wasn't anonymous at all. In fact, everybody in town
knew everything that we were doing...

I went to a meeting of Pollyannas Anonymous, and someone shared,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, I'm just so happy that we have this wonderful 12-Step group that will
solve all of our problems for us, and make God take care of our wills and our
lives for us, and make us all so happy and serene, and isn't it just
so peachy keen that we can meet like this and share our lives...?&quot;

Sociologists have announced that 2042 will be a watershed year.
In that year, whites will become a minority, and the other races,
taken together, will constitute the majority.  As soon as whites
become the minority, they will be so cool, and will have a
bunch of culture and traditions known only to other brother
whites.
<p>
Well, since us white people don't seem to actually have any of those secret
cultural and traditional things
right now, we had better get busy developing some, in preparation
for when we will become a cool minority. For example,
let's develop a tradition called &quot;Rehab&quot;:

<p>
There is a rich white cultural custom where someone uses drugs and
alcohol until they are totally wrecked, blasted, wasted, and non-functional,
preferably on television.  Then the wasted doper engages in a cultural
practice called &quot;checking into rehab&quot;. There, for a price of anything
from $7,000 to $40,000, the rich degenerate can enjoy 28 days of
detoxing and sobering up while someone preaches 12-Step cult religion
at them, and they spend their days in meetings where they confess that they never
really enjoyed getting high as a kite. It wasn't any fun at all. That's why
they spent thousands and thousands of dollars to get more dope and get even higher.

<p>
After 28 days of that, the whites walk out of rehab
and announce to the TV cameras that they have seen the light, and are
cured, and are on a different path now.

<p>
Then, a few days later, they forget all about the rehab nonsense,
and go back to doing whatever they wish to do.

<p>
Now this may seem like a pointless waste of thousands of dollars, but don't
knock it. It's &quot;traditional&quot;.  It's what the hip white people do.

The late-night TV infomercial said, &quot;Learn to trade stocks like a pro.&quot;
So I bought the get-rich-quick scheme, and tried it, and quickly lost
all of my money.
<p>
When I complained to the salesman, he said, &quot;You did trade stocks like
a pro. You used some crazy brain-damaged trading system, and you got
totally wiped out, just like the real pros have been doing lately.
So now you should get in line to receive your Federal bail-out check,
just like the real pros are doing now.&quot;

Dear Mr. Bernanke and Sec. Paulson:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    I need a bailout. I invested all of my cash funds in some risky high-profit
financial instruments &#8212; lottery tickets &#8212; and things didn't go my way. So now
I find myself a little short of liquidity, and in a credit crunch, and need a
bailout, just like AIG and Fannie and Freddie and Citigroup.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Now I realize that I'm going to have to take a financial hit for my greedy,
risky asset management. I know that I won't get more than ten cents on the dollar
for my worthless paper. Well, those lottery tickets were worth $60 million before
the market turned against me, so I guess I'll have to settle for a mere $6 million
bailout now. Oh, and you can have all of my worthless lottery tickets in return.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Please send the check this week. You know I'm too big to fail.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thank you.

Vladimir Putin, the Premier/President/Prime Minister/Czar of Russia, has announced
that he is annexing Hell as another province of the new Soviet Empire.
And the Devil will be his new right-hand man. When contacted for a comment,
the Devil said that Putin had it all wrong. No way was the Devil going to be the number-two
man. &quot;I own that bitch's soul,&quot; the Devil said. &quot;He's my servant, and Russia will be my
new province. Still, I have to admire the guy's ambition and gall.
The way that he ruthlessly murders people is refreshing. Yes, he's welcome in my domain.&quot;

<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">
In 1992, the AMA allowed a joint committee of two A.A. front groups
to write the definition of &quot;alcoholism, the disease.&quot;</a>
The resulting
definition is so goofy that it does not even say that alcoholism
is caused by drinking alcohol. It does not say what causes &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
&quot;Alcoholism&quot; is a disease without a cause.

But hey, the A.A. members must know all about it, so they are qualified to define
the disease.

<p>
Next, the AMA is going to allow Scientology to write the definition
of &quot;paranoid schizophrenia, the disease,&quot; which is what the Scientology
founder Lafayette Ronald Hubbard suffered from, so they must be
qualified to describe that disease.
<p>
Then the Moonies will write the
definition of &quot;cancer, the disease&quot;, because that's what
<a href="orange-moon.html" target="_blank">Rev. Sun Myung Moon</a>
died from.
<p>
And then the surviving members of Jim Jones' People's Temple will
write the definition of &quot;cyanidism, the disease,&quot; because
914 People's Temple members died from drinking cyanide-laced &quot;Flavoraid&quot;.
<p>
It's going to be a great new day in medicine when cult religions get
to define and describe all of our diseases.
