Hello again, Allen,

I just found your response. I don't check Gmail very often.

Thanks for the compliment about quitting. And yes, I can tell you that quitting both
alcohol and tobacco at the same time is <i>really</i> like &quot;riding a rocket
into the fourth dimension&quot;, to reuse Bill Wilson's phrase.
The improvement in your health is dramatic.
And the pink-cloud effect is delightful.

<p>
I don't have a goose coop, so I don't know about the doors. (In fact, I don't own any kind of
a bird cage. I never put goslings in a cage. They just hang out with me, and sit beside me, or snuggle
up against me, or sit in my lap, or sleep with me. So, no cage, no doors.)
<p>
Have a good day now.

I thought this was funny.

<p>
<h2>The Twelve Steps of Catholics Anonymous</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li> 1) I admit that guilt, shame, and self-denial are not virtues; that they make life less joyous.
<li> 2) I came to believe that the power for goodness within myself could restore me to reason.
<li> 3) I made the decision to decide for myself what is moral and right, and not to simply adhere to what I have been told.
<li> 4) I made a searching and fearless moral inventory to help me understand what was right and wrong for my life.
<li> 5) I admitted to myself that I might not have all the answers, but the conclusions I had come to were enough for me at this time.
<li> 6) I was entirely ready to stop judging myself and others based on an arcane and often hypocritical religious doctrine.
<li> 7) I humbly admitted that I am a mere human being and therefore not arrogant enough to claim that I know all about this supposed god and what it really wants.
<li> 8) I made a commitment to be kind, accepting, understanding and altruistic in all that I do, and to admit when I may have done wrong.
<li> 9) I made amends with others and myself for all the conflict that religion had caused in my life.
<li> 10) I continue to question the validity of religion in my life and the lives of others all over the world.
<li> 11) I sought out others who shared my beliefs of tolerance and acceptance and learned from them.
<li> 12) I try to be a freethinker in all aspects of my life, and to always be open to new people and new ideas.
</ul>

<p>
Hello-

<p>
I am a sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous that has struggled with relapse for over thirteen years.  I came across your website about a year ago and was very interested to read your point of view and arguments.  They actually helped me quite a bit to realize that there are always varied perspectives on any matter which claims to help people.  The one thing I find most interesting is that there is no reference to any information about you- the writer.  In any literary work or argument it is one of the most basic tenets to consider the frame of reference of the writer, that is the inherent bias in the author. I am curious how you expect any intelligent person to take you seriously without any background information about yourself?  I am not sending this letter as an attack, but more of a challenge to improve your site and body of work by sharing perhaps how you were motivated to engage in an endeavor to analyze Alcoholics Anonymous.  When I found your site, my first question was why? Why is this author compelled to argue against a program that when practiced as outlined has but one aim- to help repair relationships- with a Higher Power, with oneself, and with others...

<p>
Best regards,

<p>
Bryce S.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bryce,
<p>
Thanks for the question. I just found your letter. I don't use Gmail because Google has no
respect for anyone's privacy, and they read your email to figure out what advertisements to shove
at you next. So I basically just use Gmail as a spam bucket.  I found your letter while cleaning
out the spam.
<p>
Now, for your question: I have given a lot of my background and autobiographical information.
More than enough, considering that the web site is not about me.
I am a 66-year-old hairy human, and
my birth name was Terrance Hodgins, and I live in rural Oregon west of Portland.
<p>
And, I'm happy to say that I have 12, almost 13, years of sobriety now. That means no alcohol,
no drugs, and no cigarettes. And my health is really better for it.
<p>
Here are some previous answers to the &quot;who are you&quot; question: 
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters26.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">who are you</a>,

<li> <a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a> 
</ol>
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties with many years of relapsing. May I suggest that you especially
look at the fourth item in the list above? It's about how to not relapse.
<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

Now I've had a chance to read your response. Didn't get an email about it, so I
guess you're still having Hostmonster problems. I'll email you $10 or so once I
actually get a paycheck.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Meatbag,
<p>
Yes, Hostmonster presents a variety of problems.
Fortunately, I just got an offer of free hosting on another system.
I'm investigating and seeing what I have to do to move the forum over intact.  
The rest is easy.  
</font>
<p>
Anyhow, sorry to hear about your physical troubles. Medications are kind of a pain
in the butt. You might have to try a few different ones to find a painkiller that
works. Doesn't help that a lot of doctors will refuse to prescribe the most
effective ones because they're potentially addictive. The VA doctor might have
decided you were a drug seeker.

<p>
<font color="blue">
In this case, I think the doctor was just overworked and backlogged. He finally responded to
my first message (after I sent 3) and prescribed some weak painkillers that actually do work.
I think the Tramadol was just the standard routine of try a non-narcotic painkiller first,
to see if that works, and use the real painkillers as a last resort.
<p>
The painkillers that I'm getting don't eliminate the pain,
but at least they take the edge off of the pain
and make sleep a lot easier. So that's a big help.

</font>
<p>
I actually did have a discussion with one of my teachers. We watched this video that
talked about a teenage girl who had a Vicodin-abusing friend. I went against the
grain and said I wouldn't tell anybody if I was in that situation. Why? Nobody can
make the friend quit, and I figure the adults around her would do more harm than
good.  Besides, in that specific situation, the drug abuse was just a way to cope
with a broken home life.

<p>
So, yeah, the US has a fucked-up attitude towards drug use and addiction.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yes. Coincidentally, I was talking about my problems with a woman who it turned out is
a doctor &#8212;  I didn't know that at the time  &#8212;  and
she said that addiction is all in the head. She said
that she was habituated to Vicodin for 18 months for severe painful spinal problems,
and then she just quit cold turkey when her pain problems were finally taken care of surgically.
Three days of readjustment and she was just fine.

<p>
I had to agree.  I also just quit all of my addictions one day.
<p>
The idea that we are powerless over our addictions has caused a lot of harm to a lot of people.
And it causes doctors and the legal authorities to be really weird about narcotics.
They think that Grandma is supposed to die in agony so that she won't get addicted to painkillers.
That's insane.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Hello MD,
<p>
Thank you for the find. That is good. I quite agree. When you are deep in an alcohol addiction,
the thought of quitting forever is frightening. It sounds like you are going to loose your best and only
friend in your life. And
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">your little Lizard Brain will scream that you will never have any fun again</a>.
Sometimes it helps if people kind of ease into the idea, even if they need to totally quit.
Start off with the idea of cutting down, or just quitting for three months.

<p>
And of course, some people do not need to totally quit. As I've said many times,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="_blank">the Rand Corporation study</a>
study found that, of all of the alcoholics who quit self-destructive drinking, half of the
recovered alcoholics did it by total abstinence, while the other half did it by just tapering
off into moderate, controlled, drinking.  Whatever works for you.

<p>
Dr. Marc Kern is an interesting person. He has been on the
board of directors of both SMART and Rational Recovery. There is more about him here:<br>

<p>
MD W. posted in Anti &#8212; 12 step programs

<p>
AA is a Cult/Alcoholics Anonymous is a Cult

<p>
AA Is Dogmatic.

<p>
It's difficult to label as dogmatic an organization in which the most important
guiding principles (the 12 steps) are only &quot;suggestions.&quot; But despite this
disclaimer, a great many AA members are extremely dogmatic. They regard the 12
steps with the reverence that a fundamentalist has for the Ten Commandments, and
they regard the &quot;Big Book&quot; as a fundamentalist would the Bible.
Anyone doubting this should attend a few AA meetings. At most meetings, even mild
criticism of the steps or the &quot;Big Book&quot; will be met with sarcasm, anger, and
put-downs. For AA true believers, the steps and the &quot;Big Book&quot; are received wisdom
(which, indeed, Bill Wilson believed them to be); and they are to be blindly
followed, not questioned.

<p>
Further confirmation of AA's dogmatism is provided by its attitude toward the very
many alcohol abusers who investigate AA but can't stomach its program. Rather than
attempt to see why so many alcohol abusers reject AA (remember, these are
oftentimes desperate individuals urgently seeking help), and whether
anything &#8212; changes in the AA program, referral to the many existing alternative
programs &#8212; can be done to help them, AA does nothing to help these vulnerable people,
and instead blames them for rejecting AA, maintaining that the reason they can't
stand AA is their &quot;character defects,&quot; their lack of &quot;honesty,&quot; or their lack of a
genuine desire to stop drinking. This happens In every single case. And there have
been millions. To its dogmatic members, the AA program is perfect; the problem lies
solely with those who reject it.
<p>
This is the attitude of a callous, dogmatic religious sect, not that of a rational,
humanistic organization concerned with helping those afflicted by what it insists
is a deadly &quot;illness.&quot;

Hello again, MD,
<p>
I agree with all of your points. Not coincidentally, I have some of them listed as standard A.A.
bait-and-switch tricks:

<p>
<ul>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives" target="_blank">Shifting objectives:
First the goal is to quit drinking, and then the goal is to
&quot;acquire faith&quot; and &quot;come to believe&quot;
in Bill Wilson's religion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spirit_rel" target="_blank">First, A.A. is just a nice
neighborhood quit-drinking self-help group, and then it's a
hard-core religion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_purpose" target="_blank">First, it's only a &quot;spiritual&quot;
alcoholism recovery program, and then it's a fundamentalist religion
whose 'real purpose' is to make you 'serve God'.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="_blank">First, Bill Wilson declared that Alcoholics
Anonymous was only one of many ways to achieve sobriety, then he declared
that it was <i>The Only Way</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_alcoholic" target="_blank">First, A.A. members insist that Alcoholics
Anonymous does not claim to be the only way, then they
insist that any alcoholic who quits drinking without A.A. was not a <i>real alcoholic</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#your_way" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that you can do it your way.
Then they will tell you that you must do it their way.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you can't ever leave.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_threats" target="_blank">First, you get declarations of easy-going tolerance, and then,
death threats.</a>

</ul>

<p>
Also, several of your points are standard cult characteristics that are listed in the Cult Test:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think" target="_blank">6. Group-think, Suppression of Dissent, and Enforced Conformity in Thinking</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality" target="_blank">7. Irrationality.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_disbelief" target="_blank">8. Suspension of disbelief.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma" target="_blank">14. Unquestionable Dogma, <i>Sacred Science</i>, and Infallible Ideology.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">11. Insistence that the group is THE ONLY WAY.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_no_truth" target="_blank">27. You Can't Tell The Truth.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_compliance" target="_blank">89. Demands For Compliance With The Group</a>
</ul>

<p>
Okay, I guess that's enough points for now.

Have a good day.

Orange,

<p>
These are all things that I have heard in the rooms of AA for the past 17 years and
am happy to hear this is what has enabled you to solve your problem, and that you
share it with people who visit your site searching for answers.

<p>

<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Lastly, but certainly not least, and not to make light of it, this really is the
answer:
<p>
<center><h2>Just don't take that first drink, not ever, no matter what.</h2></center>

<p>
That is the answer to all questions about drinking, or &quot;just having one&quot;.

<p>
<center><h2>Just don't smoke that first cigarette, not ever, no matter what.</h2></center>

<p>
Likewise, this is obvious.

<p>
<center><h2>Play the tape to the end.</h2></center>

<p>
Imagine the situation as a movie on videotape. Don't just think about the next hour
or two, and how much fun a little drinking may be. Play the tape all the way to the
end, and see the full-blown relapse and readdiction and sickness and shame and
poverty, and how disappointed you will feel with yourself, and how hard it will be
to quit again...

<p>
That works for me.

<p>
<center><h2>Failure is not an option!</h2></center>

</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
The issue I really came to understand is and what the book Alcoholics Anonymous and
the Big Book Awakening has taught me, which of course is a matter of opinion and
like everything else as you argue about AA, is unprovable:

<p> 
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
p.32
<br>
&quot;Though there is no way of proving it, we believe that early in our drinking careers
most of us could have stopped drinking. But the difficulty is that few alcoholics
have enough desire to stop while there is yet time. We have heard of a few instances
where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism, were able to stop for a long
period because of an overpowering desire to do so...&quot; <br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
More poignantly,

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
p.34
<br>
&quot;For those who are unable to drink moderately the question is how to stop
altogether. We are assuming, of course, that the reader desires to stop. Whether
such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon the extent to which he
has already lost the power to choose whether he will drink or not. Many of us felt
that we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet
we found it impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know
it &#8212; this utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the
wish.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
From the sounds of things you took your negative experience of AA and made a
personal conquest to debunk it based on the fact that you are very likely
non-alcoholic / addict as are so many people sitting in the rooms of 12 step
programs.

<p>
When you drink or smoke again after having tried repeatedly (dry for 4.5 years twice
over and truly in my heart believed i would and could never drink or use again) to
just not drink no matter what seems to fall a little short for someone like me- a
real alcoholic/addict. It sounds like you are the case the book describes on

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
p.20-21,<br>
&quot;Then we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may have the habit badly enough to
gradually impair<br>
21<br>
him physically and mentally. It may cause him to die a few years before his time. If
a sufficiently strong reason &#8212; ill health, falling in love, change of environment, or
the warning of a doctor &#8212; becomes operative, this man can also stop or moderate,
although he may find it difficult and troublesome and may even need medical
attention.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
I am happy to lay aside my prejudice and what I think I know to consider that
perhaps you nor me will ever know the truth one way or another. I know I am peaceful
and happy and try to help others (not sure how this can ever be measured) I also
feel a profound sense of purpose and direction in life now compared with previously
during non-drinking and using periods. If I need to say AA is wrong and a cult to
have taught me this through practice of the 12 steps, then I guess you are right.

Hello Bryce,
<p>
Thanks for the response.
<p>
Alas, you are using the standard A.A. escape of declaring that people who successfully quit
drinking without A.A. were not &quot;real alcoholics&quot;.
It's the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank"><i>Real Scotsman</i> Logical Fallacy</a>
once again:
<p>
<ol>
<li>

Declare that alcoholics are powerless over alcohol.
<p><li>
When someone points out an alcoholic who quit drinking by an act of strong willpower and determination,
declare that he wasn't a &quot;real alcoholic&quot;. If he was a real alcoholic, he would have been powerless
over alcohol.
</ol>

<p>
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
<p>
Everybody from my doctor to family and friends all agree that I was an alcoholic.
(Look at a little of my personal history,
<a href="orange-letters83.html#dts" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters303.html#John_McC" target="_blank">here</a>.) 
The only people who say that I am not, or was not, an alcoholic are A.A. members
who don't want to hear that alcoholics are not powerless over alcohol, and Step 1 is wrong.

<p>
Those following supporting quotes that you copied from the <i>Big Book</i>
just show what a con artist Bill Wilson really was.
He just kept on yammering that you need his cult, and you will die without his cult.
Then he left himself an escape hatch:
If you can quit drinking without his cult, then you weren't a real alcoholic.
Yes, it's the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank"><i>Real Scotsman</i> Logical Fallacy</a>
once again.

<p>
The &quot;hard drinker/alcoholic&quot; dichotomy is just a word game, and another logical fallacy:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">False Dichotomy</a>.
As one wit said,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Bisbort" target="_blank">poor drunkards are alcoholics,
rich drunkards are &quot;hard drinkers&quot;</a>.

<p>
Then you finished with another logical fallacy and propaganda trick: 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#antirationalism" target="_blank">Antirationalism</a>:
<font color="black">
&quot;...perhaps you nor me will ever know the truth one way or another.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Yes, we can know the truth. In fact, we already do. Life is not all just a big mystery where nothing can
be proven. We can prove:  Alcoholics are not powerless over alcohol.
The vast majority of successful quitters do it alone, without A.A. or any so-called &quot;support group&quot;
or &quot;program&quot;.

There is a high rate of recovery among alcoholics and addicts,
treated and untreated. According to one estimate, heroin addicts
break the habit in an average of 11 years.
Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was
interviewed, 57% said they simply decided that alcohol was bad
for them. Twenty-nine percent said health problems,
frightening experiences,
accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.
Others used such phrases as &quot;Things were building up&quot;
or &quot;I was sick and tired of it.&quot; Support from a husband

<p>
Well I understand a little better where you are coming from now. I too would be
very upset if I saw friends and loved ones choose to use rather that to belong to
a 12 step program if they assume that is the only way to stay sober. I do not
&quot;drink the koolaid&quot; as you put it, but I do find comfort in the fellowship of
people who are choosing to live their lives clean.
<p>
I feel like a lot of the things you mentioned about AA are well known at this
point, such as what a psycho a-hole Bill Wilson was. So if you have an issue with
the program of AA, which seems to be based on your loss of people due to the
disease of addiction and the &quot;lie&quot; they are being fed that 12 step recovery is
the only way. Why don't you try promoting other methods?? Since you feel that AA
is actually hurting people it seems like it would benefit your cause of sorts
more to provide better alternatives of help promote successful treatment options.
Spending this much effort to spread negative information about any cultish group
ever the Masons or Scientology comes across as unnecessary. I can not imagine how
much hated and anger would have to go into this work that you do.  I would
strongly encourage you to promote other options. That would not only make a more
positive impact in the long run. It may make you happier too :)<br>
Thanks<br>

Hello again, Elisa,
<p>
Thanks for the reply. I do promote other methods. I talk about SMART so much that I fear
that some people might think that I'm just a salesman for the organization. And I also push
SOS and WFS. Here is the whole list of better, evidence-based methods that I recommend people
check out:<br>

<p>
And please, it isn't just about the fates of two girls. They were just the first things that I saw.
Please read the A.A. horror stories. And if you get through them, you can read about the
&quot;no medications&quot; tragedies, and then the suicides. Then you can read about the sexual exploitation
clubs:

This statement is just plain wrong:

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is very much necessary. A.A. runs a propaganda mill that is constantly promoting the A.A. quack cure.
Someone has to tell the truth to counteract their river of lies.
There are some examples here:
<a href="menu1.html#proAA" target="_blank">Pro-A.A. Propaganda, analyzed</a>.

<p>
In just the last few days, National Geographic, of all things, ran an article that is pure A.A. propaganda
and quackery. The author claims that the 12-Step program is the best and most successful cure, based
on no actual evidence or medical testing at all. Check it out.
Also see the long list of over 450 comments, including three of mine, under the name Terrance Hodgins:<br>

Then you said,

<p>
Sorry, but A.A. has planted a bad idea in your mind. It is not a matter of anger
and hatred. It's a matter of
being determined to tell the truth for the benefit of people who need to know the truth.
It is possible to speak truth without being consumed with anger and hatred.
<p>
A.A. poisons people's minds and cripples them by telling them that if they
oppose the lies of A.A. that they have a &quot;resentment&quot;, and that is a
bad thing. Bill Wilson even said that if you &quot;have a resentment&quot; that you are
&quot;axiomatically spiritually wrong&quot;: 
<p>
<a name="axiomatically"> </a>

It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no

If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about &quot;justifiable&quot;
anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't we entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly
angry with self-righteous folk? For us in A.A. these are dangerous exceptions.
We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those better qualified
to handle it.<br>

<p>
You see? Bill teaches that you cannot fight back against evil. He wanted his followers to be
emotionally crippled.
What a neat way for a cult leader to keep his followers from rebelling.

From:  	&quot;Steve S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Religion vs. Spirituality Page<br>

<p>
Hi
<p>
I wrote you long ago, and somehow stumbled on that subject topic page this morning,
just after going to a meeting last night where it was said that AA is about
Spirituality and not Religion. Most of these meetings I only sit and listen to avoid
the 'glaring eyes' that occurs most often when I speak, but will say that after some
meetings I'm approached one on one by someone who will say something positive. Point
is, it says right in the book that 'the religious folks were right all along'...and
not far from these in Bill's Story, &quot;we were reborn!&quot;.
<p>
If one knows bible text fairly well they will see text transliterated out of the
Good Book (which was used in the beginning). The 12 Steps didn't just pop up out of
thin air, the people were already sober, then they must have back tracked to see
what was done and came upon a consensus.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I understand that thing about not being able to tell the truth
in A.A. meetings. That's one of the big reasons why I don't go.

<p>
You are quite right about A.A. being religious. Half of the 12 Steps mention God directly
or indirectly, the same as in the Ten Commandments.
<p>
Alas, that story of the creation of the 12 Steps is a complete fairy tale.
No truth to it whatsoever. The truth is that Bill Wilson just wrote down Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion recruiting and indoctrination practices, the &quot;Five C's&quot;
and the &quot;Six Practices of the Sane&quot;,
to make the 12 Steps. Bill Wilson even said so. You can get the whole story here:
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson Writes The Steps</a>.

</font>
<p>
To start as a header and premise: I did not 'get sober' in AA.  Only after stopping
going did &quot;it Happen&quot;..and it was most definitely God. It was what some would call
the Christian Mystic Experiential Faith..but in that, and through that, and finally
following up..I can see that Christ was 100 percent correct. No one matches him. He
was an anomaly of the human race and couldn't have been made up..no one had the
capacity to have made him up...even the writers couldn't fully appreciate that
magnitude of his &quot;genius' but only this I know, &quot;Christ and Christ Crucified&quot;. Who
on earth could have made the claim &quot;I AM the Resurrection&quot;. Like C.S&gt; Lewis wrote,
he was either completely insane or exactly who he said he was and is..and
considering that Christianity (as opposed to Churchianity) has flourished and
resulted in some of the greatest scientists known today responsible for such as
Planck's Theory and Doppler Radar just for minute starters, I'd say that's far from
insane).

<p>
 &#8212; Decided to believe in God.<br>
 &#8212; Came to the Knowledge of God and His Wisdom through HIS actions and not ours
(otherwise, 'we would not be able to understand Him&quot;). Yet many will take that
statement as, 'came to believe in a god as I understand that god to be&quot;..rather
than..&quot;A Loving God, who is just that in our group conscious, who will restore us to
fullness and maybe bring us to consciousness or Enlightenment, as we draw closer to
Him and Understand what He is saying to Us&quot;. Otherwise, it is shaping god in man's
image rather than man being form in God's Image (God is Spirit, and those who
worship Him worship in Spirit and in Truth).<br>
 &#8212; Repentance and Confession covers many of the other steps<br>
 &#8212; Remaining in communication with Him and continue to see where we are falling short<br>
 &#8212; Forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness... rather than focusing on overcoming
resentments.

<p>
The Program never says, and therefore denies, the Power of the Risen Christ and the
Spirit of Truth because of it although Bill briefly and with an air of arrogance
(seemingly) mentions Christ. Jesus is mentioned a few more times as well scattered
throughout the book, but people seem to be blind to it.

<p>
Define Religion, Define Spirituality...there are many different definitions..for one
could be that our very lives are a reflection of the focus of how we choose to live
and what brings us to the most fulfillment: Religion.  Satanism can be a form of
spirituality by definition of 'the prince of the power of the air&quot;...Scary
Thought... &quot;Power of the air could end up being a Higher Power if it brings one to
slash religion and deny who Jesus is&quot;...&quot;Satan&quot; or Evil is perfectly happy with
bringing us a 'good life' as long as Christ is denied.

<p>
ChristiansVictorious has implemented the 12 step process as well..Christ is working
in to all these 12 steps programs somehow someway..some will See it, some will not.
I'm not sure you even have, Orange.

<p>
There's simply no doubt in my mind..even the responsibility  statement is taken
straight from Romans 15&quot;1-6 (which always reflects the Group Conscious).

<p>
Is there other ways to 'get sober'? Sure..but being sober, sober minded, and being
Given Life are not all the same things. An atheist can become sober..but remain
ignorant to God and His Knowledge. How is it possible to come to The Knowledge of
God if God doesn't even exist? As is written by one of the prophets: &quot;My people
suffer from lack of Knowledge!&quot;

<p>
&quot;Knowledge!&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you have noticed that A.A. is not a Christian religion, in spite of their claims that
the A.A. philosophy is compatible with all religions.
<p>
Have you read the file
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>?
Especially note
<a href="orange-heresy.html#no_Jesus" target="_blank">the part where</a>
the A.A. enthusiasts were yammering that God gave them A.A., and
A.A. gave them God. When I asked them which &quot;God&quot; A.A. gave them, and
whether it had anything to do with Jesus Christ, they called me a blind fuckwit.
I asked them a simple direct honest question about their &quot;god&quot;, and
they refused to answer it. Now what religion is that?
<p> 
By the way, the 12 Steps are not a good therapy program for any disease or condition.
Dr. Frank Buchman made up those cult practices &#8212; <i>practices</i>, not
&quot;spiritual principles&quot; &#8212; for recruiting and indoctrinating new
members of his cult religion.
Then Bill Wilson just wrote down all of that stuff and called them &quot;The 12 Steps&quot;.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.
