Hello again, Michelle,
<p>
I'm sure that you believe that A.A. saved your life, or somehow &quot;helped&quot; to save your life,
but fervent belief proves nothing. Belief is not evidence.

<p>
The sad facts of the matter are that alcoholics who go to A.A. do not quit drinking in any greater
numbers than those other alcoholics who quit alone. A.A. just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
and raises the rates of

And that is the experience that I am concerned about, not my personal experiences with the

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
I'm sorry to make such an strident plea for your attention in the subject line but I
urgently need your help with something. Over the years I've written to you about a
halfway house I attended some years ago. They simply parroted the 12-step dogma and
charged money for it. They're the ones who would hold you hostage in the program for
6-12-14 months at a time. They'd make us work on weekends doing free carpentry work;
they're the ones who would go to court dates with you for &quot;support,&quot; and then turn
around and ask the judge to sentence you to mandatory attendance to the halfway
house, making it impossible to leave. Anyway, a lot of the stuff that went on there
was questionable. Of course, you couldn't complain about it at the time because they
had you by the shorthairs but once I got out and started wising up I saw that it was
like being in a nuthouse.

<p>
Anyway, here's the point: I managed to gain the trust and attention of a local
reporter who is writing a story about Freedom House. He wants to use the Freedom of
Information Act to obtain information about Freedom House. He asked me if I could
think of anything he should specifically look for. I can't think of anything so I
wanted to ask you: Orange, can you think of what types of info/records he should
request which might demonstrate the unscrupulous behavior typical of these treatment
centers? I want to get back to him ASAP, as I don't want him to lose interest. Thank
you for any help you can provide.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bill,
<p>
It's good to hear from you. Thank you for your activism.
Here is what occurs to me:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Get payment records for work done. That is, worker's wages.
Did workers receive minimum wage? Did the employer make the proper Social Security payments
on the workers' wages? Were taxes properly withheld and paid to the state and Federal
governments? Did you get a W-2 for your year of work?

<p>
<li>
Were the workers' wages withheld to pay for room and board? If so, was their room
and board also paid for by the city, state, or federal programs?
That would amount to double-billing for room and board.

<p>
<li>
If the workers are unpaid, then that is slavery, which was outlawed by the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>
If the workers were paid, even just theoretically paid with room and board, then there
should be records of the wages paid and Social Security donations that the employer made
to the Federal Govt.
And the workers should have gotten W-2 forms.

<p>
<li>
Did these carpentry (and other) crews do any outside work that was billed to
someone else? That is, the halfway house working as a contractor and doing jobs for third parties?
Get those records, and compare the income to what the slave workers were paid.
Also, check whether the halfway house has a contractor's license.

<p>
<li>
Was the carpentry done on buildings owned by owners of the halfway house? If so, that
amounts to illegally diverting funds from a non-profit corporation to another party.
They can lose their non-profit status for that.

<p>
<li>
Get records for cost of maintaining the properties. It is common practice to claim that it is very
expensive to maintain the buildings that house the people, while in fact very
little is spent to maintain the property. So-called charities will give reports
to things like the United Way, explaining that a great deal was spent on
maintaining the facilities, while the money really goes into the corrupt leaders' pockets.
Get such reports and grant proposals that list the cost of running the halfway house.

<p>
<li>
Also check for claims that a great deal of work was done to maintain the property,
but the work was actually done for free by residents, who weren't paid for the work.

<p>
<li>
Get real cost of food  &#8212;  actual money spent, and compare that to what the slave labor
inmates were charged for food.  &#8212; Or what was charged off to some program for feeding the inmates.
If the halfway house claims that the cost of cooking the food was high, compare that
to what the slave labor cook was really paid.
Together, the cost of buying the food and cooking it should add up to what the workers
were charged for food. Otherwise, the workers are getting cheated, and the &quot;non-profit&quot;
is making a profit off of their slaves.

<p>
<li>
Get total income of the halfway house, and find how much of that was paid to the owners
and leaders.

<p>
<li>
Check for campaign donations from the halfway house to the judge who sentences people
to being slave labor for the halfway house. Thus, ask for records of ALL political
donations made to any candidates for anything.

<p>
<li>
Get billing records for treatments, if any. What medical care or &quot;rehab treatment&quot;
was given to the residents?

<p><li>
If the halfway house is a non-profit corporation, then check their Form 990. That is
a form that all non-profits must submit to the IRS annually, giving the details of
their finances. It is a public document, and you are entitled to a copy.
You can also use Guidestar, among others, to get a copy:
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005058/http://www.guidestar.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.guidestar.org/</a>
<p>
But Guidestar is often a year or two behind. You should be able to get up-to-date copies
of the Form 990's for all years that the &quot;non-profit&quot; has been operating.

<p><li>
A list of all of the people who were kept in that &quot;halfway house&quot;, and how many of them
got sentenced to longer times on the recommendation of staff members?

<p><li>
Do the readers have any suggestions to add?
</ol>

<p>
If I think of anything else tomorrow, which I probably will, I'll send it to you.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

Okay another:
<ol start="15">
<li>
Did any of the inmates get food stamps or welfare or SSI? Did the halfway house confiscate
that?

house the inmates?

Hi Orange,
<p>
Thanks so much for mulling this one over. I appreciate anything you come up with.
So far, I plan to ask the reporter to find out:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
* how the halfway house was able to buy 3 or 4 properties in the surrounding local
towns for little money;
<li>
* how they were immediately able to turn those residential homes into 3/4 houses
where drug addicts and alcoholics live (because these days towns put up a huge stink
when they find out who will be living in these facitilities); somehow FH pushed
these things through;
<li>
* If Freedom House broke any local union laws by using residents to perform free
carpentry and contractor services for free.
</ul>

<p>
And whatever else you can think of ~<br>
Thanks Terry &#8212; take good care<br>

Hi Orange,
<p>
Your ideas were great. Thank you very much for the great suggestions. I sent your
questions and a few of my own to the reporter. We'll see what happens. When the
reporter heard about the free labor, and the the way the counselors would ask judges
to sentence us to the halfway house, he was appalled. That's why he decided to look
into this story. That was helpful for me because I felt guilty for carrying these
skeptical thoughts around with me for so long. I live near the halfway house I
attended and you just don't question what they do &#8212; it's verboten.

<p>
Well, I hope you have a great weekend. Thanks again for all you do for us. I'll keep
you posted on how this develops.

<h3>Petition to Stop Court Assignments to Faith Based Recovery Programs</h3>

<p>
I just signed a petition to Governor Jerry Brown: Stop unwanted mandating of Citizens to Faith Based Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Offer people alternatives to these 12 step meetings. Encourage Empowerment to our citizens, not a powerless faith healing antiquated institution.
<p><br>
Some people have commented that Gov. Jerry Brown, to whom the petition is addressed, does not
actually sentence anyone to A.A. meetings. True, but he does have influence over the bureaucratic
practices of the whole state.
<p>
And Gov. Brown has a history of helping to promote cult religion as a solution to drug and alcohol
problems. He was a booster of Jim Jones' <i>People's Temple</i> cult.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
And Jerry Brown's men confiscated the <i>People's Temple</i> church records after the
mass murder/suicide in Guyana, and took them to Sacramento, and I don't know if they
have ever been seen since. The big problem was that
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Jonestown" target="_blank">the cult had
between 150 and 200 children who were wards of the state</a>,
and who had been given to Jones' <i>Temple</i> for care and
safekeeping  &#8212;  which was a real money-making operation for Jones, bringing in
tens of thousands of dollars per month.
Jim Jones illegally took the children from California to Guyana. No California official
complained or demanded that Jones bring them back.
And then Jim Jones fed the children cyanide koolaid, and killed them.
So Jerry Brown's crew made the records disappear.

Hello Susan,

The only time I say any less-than-gentlemanly words is when I say that it is insane,

and lie to them about how well the treatment really works.

<p>
And it is obviously, blatantly, wrong to do that to sick people.
<p>
How do you feel about that? Do you think that it is okay to foist
ineffective quack medicine on sick people and lie to them about how well

<p>
Why would somebody do that?

There is nothing like the 12 steps in the world. It is the furthest thing
from a cult.

<p>
It is by attraction rather than promotion. There are no dues or fees. Read
the 12 traditions .absolutely nothing holds like these do on the
planet.Period. If you find anything .please share.

<p>
There is nothing easier to do than critique, criticize, and complain. You
have your PhD in it and could teach a master class. It must be awful lonely
being an atheist.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jeff,
<p>
Thank you for the recitation of cult slogans. Every single line there is just another
standard 12-Step cult slogan. There isn't an original thought in there anywhere.
<p>
Now I can point you to a lot of evidence that A.A. really is a cult, starting with the
Cult Test, here:<br>
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult.html</a>
<br>
...but I know that your opinions will not be changed in the slightest by even a mountain
of facts. Cult slogans are what you consider evidence and valid logical arguments.

<p>
You could also read my analysis of the 12 Traditions:<br>

...but you probably won't.
<p>
 You should especially look at
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">Tradition 11</a>, about
the &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot; hypocrisy.

<p>
By the way, I'm not an atheist. That is yet another standard cult attack on critics.
You think that everybody who disagrees with your favorite superstitions is an atheist?
Not so.

Subject:  	On Nurture vs. Nature and on Free Thinking Hippies being a great source of companionship on the road to abstinence<br>

<p>
Hello again,

<p>
I have not read your response to your letter until now.  At the end of
August my companion of 8 years who looked almost exactly like you  and was a
computer programmer  and was a wonderful free thinking hippie died in his
sleep by my side.  I felt grief that was unspeakable.  I was so happy to
learn from his friends how glad they were that I was with him and that I had
given him the happiest years of his life.  You know all the propaganda
about  all of us who have  drunk too much being  selfish, abusive, lying
losers who do not merit a chance regardless of the degree of the problem ...
was really getting to me. * I was infinitely happier  and it gives me great
peace that we did spend such wonderful moments without having him see me
drunk which was an event he put up with about once a month for a few years.
It still was something he hated. * Unlike you he hated doctors and had not
gone to one in fifteen years.  Yes once in the last month, alone and
traveling I did have 3 glasses of wine.  Did not enjoy it. * It turned the
grief from a living honest loving thing into just a deadness inside and
bitterness*.  He would want me to go on.  Family was very overly worried,
and apprehensive and concerned so I could not display my emotions too much
as they took it  as a possible cue that I was on the road to get blasted.
The label is hard to shake ... it was the last thing I felt like doing  ...
but having had a past of deep depression  were I have done just that I could
not fault them .

<p>
I shared with my companion your site and he was my best buddy during these
two years of adjustment.  He was also an advocate for your site and helped
in convincing others of  our position as his experience as a companion of
person with a drinking problem lent him credibility.

<p>
On a more humorous note I just reviewed the email where we were discussing
his chosen attire and had to laugh when I saw
<a href="orange-letters91.html#goslings" target="_blank">your photo</a>
and sent it to him.  We both laughed so hard.  I had to stop giving him any flack as after
all ... this person I respect and has helped me dresses just the same.

<p>
I miss him ...but there are others out there that  agree that this is not
an incurable disease ... that  our personalities are not permanently
disfigured into hopeless inhumans unable to maintain loving relationships
without cohersive direction from AA.

<p>
My companion was wary of doctors and was worried about my taking
anti-depressants but he did not push me against it  either.  I had enough
respect for him to bring up his need for a checkup but he was stubborn and I
would never belittle him by nagging.  He ate too much and enjoyed it, quit
smoking thirty years ago,  did the hippie drugs in his youth to satisfy his
curiosity and had a Margarita once a week ... He died happy and in his sleep
of sudden cardiac arrest but I know we would have wanted to live longer and
I would have too.  Yes after we get done handling our blatant shortcomings
in terms of self-care there are other things to attend to.  It is going to
be lonely without him as he was my mind companion as well as heart
companion..  Your site and his emails where we exchanged our thoughts will
have to do.    HE JUST LOVED YOUR SITE.  He hated mind control and being
told what to do for his own good.  And no ... I managed to get him to shave
his beard but would never never dare ask him to cut his hair.... a constant
point of consternation for my Latin family.  In the end we both won on that
one.  I cut his pony tail to keep it because that was his statement and I
respected it.  And here in the country I live a great ceremony was done by
neighbors where the pray for him to get out of purgatory and lots of
rosaries because they loved him just as was.  Long hair and all.   He never
threw the <i>I AM MORAL YOU ARE NOT</i> ball at me.  And so I heard more clearly
that when I drank too much he felt left out.

<p>
Continuing our discussion ... if  3 components are needed for this
condition:  genetic, learning, and environment ... then I'm glad you agree ...
I will keep touch with the kids whose father is an abusive alcoholic.  Most
people where I live quit drinking on their own.  Drugs ... especially
cocaine use seems to be another matter.  Maybe here the stigma alienates
them so much that they do not have support of family and friends.  Not
sure.  Anyway it is good to be in a place where I can have such a positive
impact on people who have given me friendship, not thrown the AA judgment
battering ram down my heart.  They are the companions of the heart.  Their
lack of education prevents them from being companions of the intellect and
this will be tough but the heart does come first.

Hello Dan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and the standard cult slogans. Congratulations on your years of sobriety.
You did it. Nobody held your hand and did it for you. A cult religion didn't keep you sober
for 21 years.

<p>
A.A. breaking up marriages is a common problem. I just got another message
from a woman who was complaining about that recently:
<a href="orange-letters256.html#Jeannine_R" target="_blank">here</a>.
Perhaps you would like to write to her and tell her that it's all in her head?

<p>
Then, the newly-single woman is fair game for sexual exploitation. Read about
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Mike Q's Midtown Group</a>,
and
<a href="orange-clancy_i" target="_blank">Clancy I's Pacific Group</a>.
Perhaps you will find it actually very funny.

<p>
Yes, A.A. has existed for 75 years. That makes it one of the longer-lived cults, like the
Jehovah's Witnesses or Scientology, but that is nothing to brag about.
That just means that A.A. is really good at the standard cult practices like deceptive recruiting
and indoctrination of new members.
That does not show that A.A. is a success.

<p>
Apparently, you have been around Alcoholics Anonymous for a lot of years, so you
should be qualified to answer this question that no true-believer A.A. member has
ever answered honestly. Can we have some of that much-ballyhooed
A.A. &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, please? (<i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)

Hello Dave,
<p>
No matter how convinced you are that A.A. saved your life, that is not evidence that the
12-Step routine actually works to make alcoholics quit drinking. You are simply assuming a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">cause-and-effect relationship</a>
where there is none. And your recitation of all of those
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#glittering_generality" target="_blank">glittering buzz words</a>
like 
<font color="black"><i>&quot;spiritually filled with humility, kindness, and
gratitude&quot;</i></font>
is better evidence that A.A. really is a mind-bending cult religion than that A.A.
works to make alcoholics quit drinking.

<p>
It just doesn't matter what kind of warm and fuzzy feelings you get from your favorite religious
practices  &#8212;  that doesn't save alcoholics from death.
The reality is that A.A. does more harm than good:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. kills more people than it saves</a>. And A.A. raises the rates of

**     Finally, and most important, it must be remembered that abstinence
**     is a means, not an end. It is a puritanical goal that removes but
**     does not replace. It is justifiable as a treatment goal only if
**     moderate drinking is not a viable alternative and only if sight
**     is not lost of the real goal &#8212; social rehabilitation.
