Good day,

<p>

I put out a small newsletter dealing with AA and run across your writings
on a regular basis.

<p>

I always wonder about your personal experience with AA. Do you drink? If so
how much, and have you tried with success to stay sober for any length of
time.

<p>

Thank you

Hi Gregory,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question. Sorry to take so long to answer, but I've been very
backlogged on answering email.
<p>
I do not drink any alcohol whatsoever. I am one of those people who just has to totally
abstain from drinking, or else I'll drink myself to death. So I don't drink alcohol, not any whatsoever.
<p>
I have over six years off of alcohol now. I also have six years off of all drugs, including tobacco.
I am so clean and pure that it is disgusting. Now espresso coffee is my big kick.
I might eventually have to give that one up too, but so far it's okay.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hello again, Gregory,
<p>
It doesn't matter whether I have my life together. What is important is whether Alcoholics
Anonymous has its sobriety program together. It doesn't.
<p>
I do not have a web site of opinions. I collect facts. They may not be facts that you like,
but they are facts nevertheless, even facts from leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous, like
Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant, the member of the Board of Trustees who found that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">A.A. was
better at killing alcoholics than at sobering them up</a>.
<p>
The propaganda and debating technique that you are trying to use there is called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape Via Relativism</a>&quot;,
as in &quot;Well, it's just one guy's opinion versus another guy's opinion...&quot;
<p>
Perhaps you should write a letter to Dr. George Vaillant at the A.A. headquarters
and tell him that it is only his opinion that his A.A.-treated patients died.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Orange,

<p>

Gregory P. wrote in a letter dated Tue, February 20, 2007, &quot;sorry you lost
your housing but glad you got new digs. doesn't sound like you quite have
your life together from a quick read.&quot; I mean really &#8212; take a look around
the rooms. AA judges the individual that does not use the program for any
reason even for those occurrences that clearly are not within the
individuals control, whether they believe in an HP (oops AA) or not. I
wonder what Gregory might have to say to one of his sponsees if he had to
find new digs. What a cheap shot.

<p>

I am sure you are used to people attempting to make all this personal and
you make it clearer than I ever could that whether we have our lives intact
or not does little to disprove the fact that AA does not work. The ad
hominems are dull, wasted, and a tool to silence the doubter &#8212; they do
little to ascertain anything, but they do prove one thing; people will be
shamed for asking, questioning and stating the truth by certain members of
this program, members I might add that claim to have a desire to help the
alcoholic.

<p>

I hope you are well Orange and that you are settling into your new digs. I
also want to thank you ONCE again for allowing me to question all this,
including your conclusions, without silencing me or getting personal. You
have taught me than the mere facts of this program; you have taught me the
precise mode of learning; question, question and question.

<p>

You might not want to express an opinion but I would like to &#8212; I think you
are helping more people than AA ever could and I commend you for your
efforts and I for one know how hard it is to continue to do so when so many
want to use your personal life as a flare to distract everyone from the
facts they cannot answer. Did Gregory ever consider that through your
struggles in finding a new home, you did not use or drink? I doubt it &#8212; but
if you had been in the program he wouldn't have either &#8212; he'd have told you
to be grateful. Go figure.

<p>

Hang in there my friend.

Hi James,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, I noticed what a cheap shot that was, the guy saying that he was so
sorry that I &quot;had to&quot; find new housing.
I let it slide because it wasn't really worth arguing about.
It's almost funny how he managed to twist everything around,
pulling off a complete reversal of reality (which is
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial">another common cult characteristic</a>).
I came into a windfall and was using it to move into <i><b>much</b></i> better housing,
four times the size and much prettier and newer, and just nicer,
and he felt so sorry for me.  It's enough to make you laugh.
<p>
And yes, the avoidance of the issues is glaring.
<i>&quot;Let's not talk about the actual A.A. success or failure

From:   &quot;Peter H.&quot; <br>
Subject:        Hey.<br>


<p>
Orange &#8212;

<p>
I've been an AA member for seven years, yet oddly enough I agree almost
wholeheartedly with your assessment of the organization.   AA as a whole is
filled with some of the most sick, screwed up, sociopathic people I've come
across, nobody seems to stay sober (or even stay), and I regret my first few
years of whirlwind involvement when I bought into that whole scene and all
but walked away from the rest of my life.  AA's history, including Wilson's
past, is indeed quite spotty.  I don't believe any of those guys were to be
worshipped as they somehow have now become.

<p>

Yet I say &quot;almost wholeheartedly&quot; because of two things.  First, a lot of
the &quot;facts&quot; about AA you use in your assessment are things that have not
come from AA literature, but from meetings and the &quot;society of AA&quot;.  For
instance the 90 meetings in 90 days creedo, the issue of medications and
being/not being on them, those are things that were developed somewhere
along the way by who-knows-who sitting in some meeting somewhere, on the
other end of a game of telephone.  I've always questioned the credibility of
anything that's purported to be from AA that I couldn't find written
anywhere.  I wouldn't base my take on the preachings of AA on what Joe
Schmoe from Arkansas says about it any more than I'd invest my life savings
into a corporation based on financial projections from an illiterate mail
room worker.

<p>

Secondly, after all but walking away from the society of AA at this point in
my life, I still have to believe that spirituality in some degree is
beneficial.  My take on AA from my stint here is that no matter what the
laundry list of fallible intricacies they have perpetuated over the course
of their 70-plus year existence, the main point they were getting at was
that a lot of character flaws, including compulsive drinking, could be
overcome by pursing a death of self, a collapse of the ego.  This seems to
be a running theme in a lot of religious and spiritual bodies, from eastern
factions to parts of Christianity (though the Christians refer to &quot;the self&quot;
as &quot;the flesh&quot;).  I can't argue that spirituality, no matter the direction
from which it's pursued, can be all bad.  There are many people across the
planet pursuing the same goal for various reasons who have probably never
heard of AA.  For a parallel, I believe in the original principles on which
this country was founded, despite the fact that many of the forefathers were
slave-owning womanizers, and subsequent (and current) presidential
administrations have succeeded in dragging this country through the mud in
ways I could never imagine.

<p>

Regards and take care,<br>
Bill

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the comments.
Sorry to take so long to answer &#8212; I'm way behind in answering email.
<p>
First off, I quote many parts of the Alcoholics Anonymous whole, because that is what A.A. really is.
Alcoholics Anonymous is what the members make it &#8212; all of the members,
including institutions like the Hazelden Foundation, and propagandists like Mel B. and Ernest Kurtz,
and
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys">
the phony &quot;experts&quot; who fake scientific studies</a>
in order to try to make A.A. look good.
The &quot;real A.A.&quot; is not some perfect council-approved abstraction.
The real A.A. is what really exists
right here, right now, in the real world. The real A.A. is what people really get when they are
sentenced to A.A. or sent to a treatment center.
The real A.A. is also things like the &quot;Mike Q. group&quot;
or &quot;Midtown Group&quot; in Washington DC, which we have just been
talking about a bunch, where underage girls get raped by their sponsors.
(<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group">See here</a>.)
For the girls who get raped, that's the genuine real A.A. experience, and they are
just as raped, no matter whether it is council-approved or not.
<p>
About spirituality and collapse of ego: I am all for spirituality, and
I know that it is not spiritual to lie to sick people about how well a
certain treatment works. And yet, every A.A. meeting I have
ever attended was begun by reading a list of Bill Wilson's lies from
pages 58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i> &#8212; stuff that is blatantly, obviously, untrue.
But nobody will cut the crap and start telling the truth.

<p>
And the Twelve Steps are not a program for collapsing ego. That was just one of Frank Buchman's lies,
which Bill Wilson copied. The practices in the Twelve Steps are Frank Buchman's techniques for recruiting
and indoctrinating cult members. See
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">
The Religious Roots of the Twelve Steps</a> for much more on that.
<p>
Even the terminology &quot;collapsing ego&quot; is wrong. It implies that the ego must be made smaller or
crushed or suppressed. That is what cults like the Oxford Groups do to people &#8212; try to
suppress people's
individuality, and their minds, and their independence.
But that is not a valid spiritual practice. Really transcending ego often makes your ego much
larger &#8212; like that you might experience yourself as a very large group of people,
or as the air in a space,
or as part of the lifestream,
or as part of an eternal energy flow, or as part of the Universal Superconsciousness.
<p>
Remember that your ego is merely your concept of yourself &#8212; your idea of what you are.
There is nothing wrong with having an ego. In fact, you must have an ego, or you cannot live in the
material world.
<p>
Mind you, having an ego is not the same thing as egotism. Cults will tell you that they are the same,
in order to put you down, but they aren't the same thing at all.
<p>
Now stepping outside of your old ego, and trying on a new
ego &#8212; a new concept of what you are &#8212; is a fine experience, and can lead to growth.
That is a very different thing than just flipping out and deciding that you have been selected
as
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#make_believe">one of God's special messengers</a>,
like Bill Wilson did. That is just
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#aacoa_experience">megalomania and paranoia</a> &#8212;
extreme egotism &#8212; insanity, not spirituality.

<p>

Have a good day.

Subject:  	Held Hostage<br>

<p>

Agent Orange:

<p>

Read <a href="orange-letters73.html#Shannon">letter from Shannon H.</a>
I could empathize with her situation.
<p>
I have never had a DUI or lost a job or had family problems or had embarrassing
moments.
<p>
I had a serious coworker issue at work and did not want to show up for work. Well,
against better judgement I went. However, I showed up drunk. My place of employment
had a &quot;Last Chance&quot; program for employees who have been with the company for many
years. I signed up for the program.
<p>
The program I went to was an IOP CD (Intensive Out Patient, Chemical Dependency)
program through Banner Hospital.
<p>
The counselor of the IOP is hard core AA. I have heard of AA, but did not know much
about the program. I went along with whatever was said, beings how this is where I
was put. This must mean I am getting what I need, right?
<p>
I had three 3 hour sessions a week for 8 weeks and was required to attend a minimum
of 3 AA meetings a week (recommended 90 meetings in 90 days). I was being immersed
in AA ideology. Even though I kept hearing how I was an alcoholic and would be in a
&quot;recovery process&quot; mode for the rest of my life as I just might take another drink
because I am powerless of alcohol, I just knew there had to be something in all this
jargon to help me with my coping with coworkers problem.
<p>
I started drinking about 3 years ago when my kids left home. At IOP we had to do
time lines showing our 1st drink ever taken to our last. My time line was pretty
sparse, however the counselor stated that since I took my first drink at 5 years old
at my dads poker party I have been an alcoholic since I was 5. I was given, I
believe it was 6 different tests which will give you an indication if you are an
alcoholic or not. The counselor finally had a test which said I was. All this did
not seem right. Why was so much time and attention given to prove everyone in the
IOP group was a hopeless alcoholic? Why were we told not to think for ourselves (our
brain was an itty, bitty, shitty committee). Why did every answer to any question
have to be referred to the Big Book or any one of Bill W's writings or doing the 12
steps or solved with an AA quote? Why, all of a sudden, I must go to AA meetings, do
the 12 steps over and over again, socialize with only AA people in order to survive?
<p>
All I want to do is to learn some coping skills. Why was it I was severely chastised
early on in the program when I mentioned I thought AA was a cult (I do have
experience in this area as my youngest son was involved in one).
<p>
Thus my search. And in my search I discovered your web site. It was so refreshing to
find people who were seeing AA for what I was seeing. I have graduated from the IOP
program and am in a 6 month aftercare program with the same counselor. I asked him
if I could substitute 1 of my 3 required AA meetings for next 6 months with 1
meeting of WFS (Women For Sobriety) and 1 meeting with CoDA (Codependancy Anonymous)
&#8212; both recommended by my &quot;Back-to-work&quot; counselor. He said no. AA all the way. I
feel trapped and wonder if I am going to make it through the next 6 months. For now,
every AA meeting I attend &amp; speak at; I will say I have not a problem in the world
and will tell all the AAer's God is on my side and I need no other.
<p>
BTW: I mentioned to the counselor about a university accepting me for a Masters
program. Counselor said, No. All this would be too much for me right now and I
might relapse.
<p>
My life is not my own anymore. I want AA exposed. Any ideas would be appreciated.
Thanks for letting me vent ...... did feel good! :)

<p>

Sandy


<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sandy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for venting. As you have already figured out, lots of
people end up trapped in your situation. It's the standard 12-Step cult recruiting routine.
<i>&quot;Attraction, not promotion&quot;</i> like hell. It's really <b>&quot;Coercion, not attraction.&quot;</b>
<p>
About what to do? Well obviously, first, take care of yourself and protect yourself. That means rolling with
the punches until you are out of &quot;the program&quot;. And then...
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The first answer I have is publicizing the truth, which is what I am doing with this web site.<br>
And you are doing it by writing your story and sending it here.

<li>
Then there is writing letters to Senators and Congressmen, and informing
them that the &quot;recovery industry&quot; that they are funding is crooked.
<li>
And then I am wondering why people don't sue those treatment centers and counselors who force quackery
and cult religion on sick people. That is clearly malpractice, and those
fraudulent &quot;treatment providers&quot; deserve to get sued out of existence.
</ol>

<p>
Good luck, hang in there, and have a good day.

<p>

Thanks.

<p>

I really love your section on Deprogramming your own mind. Very well done.
And very good tools. AA seems to have no tools.

<p>

I have tried to work with What is what we need to do vs. what we should
avoid.

<p>

I did some research this week on the Catholic Virtues that cancel out the 7
Deadly sins. you may like the summary, I went to see a comedy about &quot;Let
Nuns be in Charge&quot;. She gave an analogy for the 7 Deadly sins. I asked where
was the analogy for the 7 Virtues that will cancel out the deadly sins. Ok,
I was raised Catholic during the Vatican 1 and V2 transition. But the logic
is still there. What we focus on is our reality. I prefer to focus on what
helps us vs. what we should avoid.

<p>

Good site. Freaked me out that someone took this much work on it.

<p>

Good web site. Good work.

Subject:  	please let me rant<br>

<p>

You don't know what a relief it is to find someone who will understand how irritated
I am at the treatment center I went to.  Not that they weren't sincere, they were,
it's just that they had important part of  people's life's in their decision making
process, which was all about AA and this whack therapy called Trauma,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160730204702/http://WNW.Cmdr.com/">HTTP://WNW.Cmdr.com/</a>,
which is basically laying on of hands, tapping, or even, just
moving the eyeballs back and forth. Quack therapy at best. What it doesn't include
is medicine that would help in reduction of cravings.  You have to &quot;get the
program.&quot;  Well it was pretty obvious that most of the people getting through the
program just drank on the weekends and tapered off to pass the Monday urine/breath
test.

<p>

I got out still needing a way to stay sober for a longer period of time.  When I
told my psychiatrist this, he became angry, ended treatment, refused to give me
more medicine, and gave me the name of a treatment center that would cost $48,000
for 5 months.  Needless to say, I don't have that amount of money.  I confronted
him about the lack of prescription, as people have killed themselves going cold
turkey off Effexor, and he said well you will just have to go to the ER then,
won't you.  The sad thing about this Dr, is that he was the head of the local
mental health institute and still is very active how the institution is run.  As
he doesn't believe in medication for cravings, the medicines are rarely prescribed
across that mental health system, which includes a large in and outpatient D/A
treatment center.

<p>

Luckily, my GP is a cool guy who knows lots of people and he gave me a good
referral.  My new Dr and I compared some research and we choose Topamax.  It has
been a gift from God.
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
  I want to become a street preacher and tell people about
the glories of Topomax, letting alkies everywhere know that there may be help for
them.  I broke down and told someone at an AA meeting I went to the other night
about it, as he looked so sad and desperate about his slips but when I told him,
he looked like I told him to drink poison.

<p>

Not letting alcoholics even try meds to reduce cravings reminds me of when people
didn't think women should be given pain medicine during childbirth as the bible
says that childbirth should be painful, or not allowing contraception as the bible
says we should be fruitful and multiply.

<p>

Thanks for letting me vent, it really helped.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Barbie,
<p>
Thanks for venting. It really does help when people publicize the kind of quackery
that is going on in the so-called &quot;recovery industry&quot;.

<font color="green">
&quot;Isn't there a good really vicious mad-dog blood-sucking lawyer out there who
wants to make a few million with a class-action lawsuit?&quot;
</font>
This field is really ripe for such a lawsuit.
Such blatant quackery and malpractice really should be exposed and punished.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Daphne F.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Religious Roots of AA<br>


<p>

A. Orange,

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I see you value one of AA's many principles,
ANONYMITY.  I like that one too. One of my faves.

<p>

The steps do not &quot;spell out&quot; the spiritual principles.
They represent spiritual principles.  You seem to be
&quot;balking&quot; at wording and ideals that are nearly 70
years old.  We don't use the word &quot;whatever&quot; in the
same context that they used it in then. There are a
lot of strange words and phrases that are no longer
customary.  Who says John Barleycorn anymore?  Seems a
bit silly to me.  Religion isn't very prevalent
either.  I overlook some odd words and ideals to get
the bigger picture.  The real point in the 12 step
program is to get better, not get well.  Progress is
the point.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Daphne,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, but hold on right there. The 12 Steps are just a rewrite of Frank Buchman's
cult practices. There are no spiritual &quot;principles&quot; in them.
The 12 Steps are PRACTICES &#8212; things you do, not PRINCIPLES, which are like moral standards.
Making lists of all of your shortcomings and wrongs and confessing them to your sponsor is a cult
practice, not a moral principle.
And
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">conducting a s&eacute;ance in Step Eleven</a> and listening for The Voice of Higher Power to tell you
what to do is an OCCULT PRACTICE, not a spiritual principle.


<p>
And it is not a matter of archaic language. Frank Buchman was clearly using deceptive cult recruiting
and indoctrination practices in his &quot;Five C's&quot; and &quot;Six Practices of the Sane&quot;.
See
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">orange-rroot090.html</a>. You will find all of the precursors of
Alcoholics Anonymous practices there.
</font>
<p>

Alcoholics have no chance of being like &quot;normal&quot;
people.  We don't think like normal people do.  We
certainly don't act like normal people do.  We have a
hopeless condition that requires a &quot;total psychic
change&quot; if we want to live happy productive lives.
Those of us who are beaten down enough ARE willing to
go to any length and are certainly willing to take
certain steps and meet a few simple requirements to
stop the madness of our completely hopeless situation.
I have tried to recover without praying it didn't
work.  I don't know why but it didn't.  By the time I
came to AA I had tried everything I could think of to
stop drinking on my own TO NO AVAIL.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you are trying to foist the usual A.A. stereotype of &quot;The Alcoholic&quot; on us.
Alcoholics are not a separate species of animal, different from normal humans.
Alcoholics <i>ARE</i> normal humans, just normal humans with a really bad drinking problem.

<p>
<a name="Conner"> </a>
Alcoholics Anonymous constantly declares that they want to reduce the stigma of alcoholism, and then
they turn around and parrot this garbage about how alcoholics are abnormal subhumans, which only
increases the stigma of alcoholism. (If alcoholics are all just mentally-defective powerless sinners,
why would you want to trust one?)
<p>
It reminds me of the current Miss USA, Tara Conner, who went on the Jay Leno show a couple of
weeks ago. She was fresh out of a rehab center with 58 days of sobriety, and
was just full of the A.A. slogans, and she announced,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Everything that comes out of the mouth of an alcoholic or an addict is a lie.&quot;<br>
</font>
Apparently, she didn't have the brains to notice that, since she was a self-proclaimed alcoholic,
that statement
from her also had to be a lie. (That is a classic example of the Greek Epimenides's paradox
about &quot;All Cretins are liars&quot;.)

<p>
The situation with alcoholics is not hopeless. That is just Step One again &#8212; you are supposedly
powerless over alcohol. Again, you are showing us that the 12 Steps are cult nonsense, not
&quot;spiritual principles&quot;. Alcoholics quit drinking all of the time, so they are not powerless.

<p>

Your &quot;to no avail&quot; argument is worthless. You may have tried everything that you could think of,
but what does that mean?
Did you expect somebody else to do the quitting for you? Did you think that somebody would make it
easy for you?
You obviously didn't think of really quitting and just staying quit, no matter what.
</font>
<p>

I have no idea why AA works as well as it does.  I
only care that it DOES work.  I am certainly no
religious freak.  FAR from it.  The vast majority of
us are not religious at all.  Those who are keep it to
themselves typically. I would have never been accepted
by the Oxford Group.  I would  have been rejected too.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. does not work. It has a zero-percent success rate, above normal spontaneous remission.
If you think A.A. works, why don't you answer these simple questions:

<p>
<center>
<font color="#9F0000">
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many of them will pick up a ten-year coin
for sobriety?<br>
How about the 11-year coin? What percentage of the newcomers go on to get an 11-year coin?<br>
How many success stories are there really, out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A.?
</font>
</center>

</font>
<p>

I don't care why Mr. Wilson wrote the steps.  Those
steps have helped many thousands upon thousands of men
and women recover a day at a time from alcoholism.
Why would you or anyone else want to belittle that?
Your motive is unclear in your &quot;article&quot;.  I am only
curious about your motive.  Did you go to an AA
meeting?  Were they rude?  Some alcoholics are a bit
crass but most aren't.  We can be a narcissistic
bunch.  However we truly try to be understanding and
compassionate.  Love and tolerance tends to be the
code.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, the Steps haven't helped anybody. They are just some harmful cult religion practices
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">that actually raise the A.A. death rate</a>.

</font>
<p>

If Acceptance, Faith, Surrender &amp; Trust, Honesty,
Courage, Willingness, Humility, Forgiveness, Freedom,
Perseverance, Patience and Charity &amp; Love are not good
things to &quot;practice in all my affairs&quot; then I am at a
loss.  They seem good to me.  A lot better than what I
have practiced in the past.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Lots of good buzz-words there. What does that flowery talk have to do with lying to the
newcomers with lines like:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;
</font>
?

</font>
<p>

I have a little challenge for you.  For one week just
try to practice the &quot;principles&quot; on the list that are
character traits in your everyday life.  You'll never
get it perfect.  No one does.  Just try it.
Acceptance (traffic, Road construction, idiots
everywhere!) Honesty (duh don't lie by omission or
otherwise!) Courage, Willingness, Humility,
Forgiveness, Patience, Charity and Love.  Let me know
how it goes if you will.

<p>
<font color="blue">
How do you know that I didn't start practicing those things 40 or 50 years ago?
Do you believe that only members of your favorite cult are spiritual?
</font>
<p>

P.S. AA has no monopoly on recovery everyone is free
to find it where ever they can.  We have no need to
recruit anyone.  The court system sends them to us
when they mess up bad enough.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Coercive recruiting is nothing to be proud of. If you were really spiritual you would not even allow it.
</font>
<p>

Subject:  	Losing a loved one to REHAB<br>

<p>

I just read your site and wow! so much of what you talk about is what I seem to be
living right now!
<p>
My g/f of three years recently came to me and admitted to being addicted to
prescription meds. We immediately enrolled her in a rehab center called Starlite
outside of San Antonio.
<p>
As far as I knew, our relationship was great and up until the day she left she
insisted she had to go, for her and for us. I had just signed on a new house that we
were to move into, and the day before she left she asked me to drive down there so
she could have a last look at OUR new home before she left. As far as I will ever
knew, our relationship was about as solid as they come, and I made it VERY clear
that I'd do what ever it took to get her healthy and back on solid footing.
<p>
Her 1st two weeks in rehab, she called everyday, and told me it was hell, but always
followed up with &quot;but the thought of being back with you gets me through each day&quot;
or something similar.
<p>
During her 2nd week there, she cut off ALL communication, with me, her family, and
her ex husband who was very supportive of her getting help and who also took
temporary custody of their 4-year-old son while she was away (he's a good guy and
happens to be a friend of mine as well). NO ONE could figure out why she wasn't even
calling her son.
<p>
Well, the last couple of days she was there, she called her mother and her ex
husband, and told them she would be coming home for one week to see her son and then
straight to Dallas to a Sober Living home (still no communication at all to me). She
came home (I didn't even know her flight number or time), and her mother picks her up
and takes her to her house with her son. She stayed two days instead of a week, and
just left the kid with her mom, got in her truck and took off for Dallas. At the
advice of an addiction specialist, I stayed away these two days, he told me she
would approach me when she was ready. From talking to her mother and other family
members, they said she was absolutely beligerant with them any time they questioned
what she was planning etc. They all felt like she viewed them as the enemy and that
they had somehow lost the kind, caring thoughtful woman who had left thirty days
before.
<p>
I tried calling her numerous times to no avail.
<p>
On tuesday of last week her mother called me and said we needed to talk. After my
g/f had left, the racoons had ripped open the trash outside and scattered it all
over. Upon picking it up, her mother found MANY notes between my g/f and a guy named
Mark. All written back and forth on what looked like lesson plans from the twelve
step program. From the look of it, the two of them sat through class writing love
notes back and forth and planning their future together in Dallas. And looking at
the dates on some of them I realized this &quot;romance&quot; started a little over a week
into the program. We both sat there in the lawn and cried.
<p>
Anyway, I was devastated at losing her like this and so ashamed as she apparently
was even willing to give up her most adored little boy (she had told family that she
had to be willing to give up EVERYTHING including her son in order to be clean).  I
called her cell phone that night and left her a long message about the notes etc.
She called back not more than two minutes later and berated me for even questioning
her integrity and told me how disgusted she was in me etc., and said that it was
none of my business, or her mom's business or anyone elses business as to what she
was doing. She said
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;No more living to make other people happy! The one thing I
learned in there was that this is my life and from now on I'm making decisions for
me! And you have no right questioning what I do with my life!&quot;
</font>
<p>
WOW! None of my
business???? Thirty days before we were planning our future together, and without a
word of explanation it's none of my business???
<p>
I'm slowly getting over it all and beginning to move myself into my new/far too
large home.
<p>
<a name="romances1"> </a>
My question to you is, how common do you think romances like this are? The addiction
specialist I know told me that these &quot;rehab romances&quot; are a dirty little secret of
those places and happen way more often than anyone is willing to admit. True????
<p>
Write back, I'm hurting so badly and am really just trying to understand what went
so horribly wrong in such a short period of time!
<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello J.,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your pain and loss.
<p>
I don't know how common such romances in rehab centers are &#8212; I just don't have any numbers or
statistics.
<p>
I do know that a standard slogan is to tell newly-detoxed alcoholics and addicts
not to get into any new relationships during
the first year of sobriety. But that rule gets broken all of the time, and recovery groups are often
called just little Peyton Places.
<p>
One of the problems with many rehab programs is that they have the attitude that they are going to
break down the old personality of the client (&quot;destroy the addictive personality&quot;)
and create a new personality &#8212; one of a person who is &quot;in recovery&quot;.
Unfortunately, some of the rehab centers really do know how to use brainwashing techniques effectively.
(<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Still, such a major personality change so rapidly is frightening.
<p>
<a name="spill_off">
The statement that 
she had to be &quot;willing to give up EVERYTHING&quot; is typical cult fare.
Such
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_black_white">extreme black-and-white thinking</a>,
even to the point of abandoning her own child, is insane. And yet that is just the kind of thinking
that Steppers teach.
<p>
I got the very same thing, almost word for word identical, when I was &quot;in treatment&quot;.
I was trying to explain to
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">my cocaine-snorting child-molesting &quot;counselor&quot;</a>
that I was missing A.A. meetings and not making my quota
because I had bronchitis and pneumonia and couldn't go out in the cold night air in December to get to
A.A. meetings. But I never even got to say that whole sentence because he went off on a tangent about how
I could not let ANYTHING get in front of my recovery, and that if I REALLY wanted to recover, I would
get to the meetings somehow.
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
&quot;Recovery must be the most important thing in your life.
You can't let <b>anything</b> get in front of your recovery. There is <b>no excuse</b> for not
going to meetings.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Fortunately, I ignored his nutty advice and took care of my health first.<br>
<p>
<a name="plate"> </a>
By the way, he was also the
&quot;counselor&quot; who told me not to stop smoking at the same time as I quit drinking.
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
&quot;If you put too much stuff on your plate, something will
spill off.&quot;</i></font><br>
<p>
Get a load of that: I was quitting smoking because I had bronchitis and
pneumonia, and he was telling me not to quit smoking &#8212; just concentrate on quitting drinking.
Such is the kind of &quot;help&quot; that you get
in far too many &quot;treatment programs&quot;.


<p>
I wish I could come up with some answer for what to do about your friend.
Alas, I don't have any magical sage advice. It sounds like the damage is done and she is gone.
<p>
Have a good life.

Hi AO:

<p>

I just read
<a href="orange-letters79.html#tc_nightmare">J's story</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

From: J.<br>
Subject: Losing a loved one to REHAB<br>

</blockquote>

<p>

I wanted to offer a little insight, if you would care to relay it to him.
Unfortunately, I doubt that I can offer any comfort, but I certainly extend
my condolences.

<p>

Specifically, he asks at the end of the story:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
My question to you is, how common do you think romances like this are? The
addiction specialist I know told me that these &quot;rehab romances&quot; are a dirty
little secret of those places and happen way more often than anyone is
willing to admit. True????
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

I have been in two in-patient treatment centers, as well as literally
growing up in and around the treatment center industry, so I feel I'm
qualified to speak here.

<p>

Are these romances a &quot;dirty little secret&quot;?  I'm not sure exactly what J
means, but are they common?  Absolutely.

<p>

When people enter these facilities, they are immediately beaten down.  One
needs only to read through your many letters to get a glimpse of what that
means.  Essentially, they try to strip you down so that you can be built
back up to their liking.

<p>

That means being treated like children... dirty, rotten little spoiled
children who must have their spirits broken.

<p>

It's basic human psychology.  Anytime you take adults and treat them like
children, the ones in the children's role are going to rebel.  When this is
done in a group setting, and there are multiple &quot;children&quot; interacting, an
&quot;us versus them&quot; mentality is quickly established.  Even if staff members
are liked, it will exist to some degree.  Believe me, this is a natural
occurrence and happens in every facility.

<p>

Now as a result of this, strong bonds are formed between &quot;patients&quot; or
&quot;clients&quot;.  I know this bond, and it doesn't have to be opposite sex either.
When it is opposite sex, however, this bond can quickly be confused for
intimacy.  It's seldom genuine, but it will seem very real for a period of
time.

<p>

J's girlfriend likely forged a friendship with this other guy, and as their
humiliation grew with all of the &quot;therapy&quot;, it just got confused for more.
You see, she's removed from everything that she knows and loves, daily
attempts are made to make her cry (this constitutes &quot;growth&quot;) and she can
only seek comfort where it is available, between the walls of the treatment
center with the other &quot;children&quot;.

<p>

Now it is true that many AA sponsors and treatment center workers advocate
no relationships for a year.  This evolved from the teaching that one
shouldn't make any major life changes in the first year if avoidable, such
as a job change, divorce, etc.  Like many things, it's been twisted.

<p>

I would completely agree that a person quitting their addiction should leave
a significant other if that other person continues to drink/use and makes an
effort to bring the person down.  But that clearly isn't the case with J.
He made it clear that he would support and encourage her through this from
the beginning.

<p>

The only good news is that if she's still in the facility, it's unlikely the
relationship has progressed to being physical.  If J can relay that he will
be supportive of her recovery then she might come to her senses eventually.
I would advise him not to say anything negative about the treatment she's
getting right now though, even though it's clearly doing harm.  Another us
versus them mentality is being instilled in her, and right now she'll see
him as a&quot;normie&quot;.

<p>

She'll be there for her son eventually.

<p>

A sad story indeed, and what is sadder is how common it is.

<p>

<p>

Hello again, Dennis,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I think you hit the nail right on the head.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any way for J. to save his marriage.
And alas, the relationship has progressed to physical.
She is out of the treatment center and gone to Dallas to live with her new boyfriend.
<p>
For a treatment center to mess up a person's mind like that after it has promised to help her
is once again just the most despicable malpractice.
<p>
Where are the blood-sucking ambulance-chasing lawyers when you need one?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	RE: J's story<br>

<p>

Thanks Orange.

<p>

I had a thought I had intended to share with you earlier, but didn't:

<p>

I've noticed several reply letters, usually to steppers, that ask about
success rates and how many new members out of 1,000 go on to acquire a 10
year coin.

<p>

I was thinking that the rate of alcoholics that do is actually lower than
what the numbers indicate, because there are so many people, and I mean
LOTS, that aren't alcoholic, they are just so in love with the cult.  Yeah I
know, I can't take their inventories, but they are in the rooms in
abundance.

<p>

About a year and a half ago, when I started meetings again (I'm now 6 months
meeting free), I ran into Dale, whom I hadn't seen in 17 years.  Dale
boasted 18 years sober, is now in his thirties, and hasn't done squat with
his life.

<p>

I know that in all probability, Dale drank only once in his entire life.  He
was a regular at Alateen meetings and his sister went into rehab, so he got
a lot of exposure to AA and latched on to us as much as he could.  He was a
really dorky kid.  One night, he called me and my friend Eric (we were both
teens in AA then, and Eric dated Dale's sister) and started talking crazy.
We went to his house and he was drinking malt liquor out of a paper bag, and
probably hadn't even drank 10 ounces.  We called him an idiot and left.  The
next day, he was getting his beginner's token.

<p>

I can think of countless people I've known in Alanon, Alateen and other
programs over the span of 25 years that even though weren't drinkers, came
to the conclusion that they were alcoholic and started to go to AA meetings
too.

<p>

Obviously, the AA's have higher &quot;spiritual status&quot;, and are seen above the
other steppers.  The gal I mentioned in a previous letter that attempted
suicide is one such person, big into Alanon and then crossed-over.

<p>

Pretty pathetic, really.

<p>

I hope you don't mind all of these letters, I know you're busy with others.
I just have a lot to say now that my thinking has kicked in.

<p>

Hi again, Dennis.
<p>
Thanks for the input. I couldn't agree more. Something that A.A. really doesn't want to talk about
is the people who are just in love with A.A. as a cult religion &#8212; who actually have no need
of a sobriety program &#8212; who just like being &quot;in recovery&quot; as a life-style and a social club
and a philosophy of life.
<p>
When you think about it, most other cults are built on the basis of something other than
claiming to cure drug and alcohol problems. And yet, they attract the same kinds of personalities,
many of them the true believers in search of something to believe in.
The newcomers take to the cult like a duck to water &#8212; it's love at first sight.
They are just as Bill Wilson described:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;When we reached A.A., and for the first time in our lives stood
among people who seemed to understand, the sense of belonging was
tremendously exciting.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1" color="black"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 57.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, welcome to your new family.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. And don't worry about too many letters from you. I like your comments and
the thoughts that you add to the discussion.

Dear orange,

<p>

Thank you so very much for your website.<br>
<p>
I have been a member of GA for seven months now.   Although I truely
appreciate the opportunity for me to come to know the others who share the
same or similar gambling problems like mine, I never felt right being in the
meetings.  I came to notice there are a certain group of people who I just
can't understand what they are doing.  They are the true
believers of Twelve Step programs (often more than two A' meeting members in
addition to GA).

<p>

I have a personality easily manipulated, but I always knew deep inside
something was wrong in the meetings.

<p>

Thank you so very much for validating my feelings and thought.<br>
You literally saved my life, so I can get out of this cult.

<p>

THANK YOU<br>
-jennie

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason
for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the
mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is
enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day.
Never lose a holy curiosity.<br>

Agent Orange, given its name from the 55 US gallon orange-striped barrels it

Hello Michelle,
<p>
I'm quite familiar with the chemistry of agent orange. Back in the seventies, I worked on
a protest project to keep the leftover poison from being dumped here in the USA.
<p>
My <i>nom de plume</i> is derived from
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Agent_Orange">a joke about mixing apples and oranges</a>, however.

Have a good day.

Actually, no, I did not get to state my case.<br>
You cut me off after just a few postings.<br>
What other people may have said before I came along
has nothing to do with me, and they do not speak for me.

Nor did they say all of what I would have said.
