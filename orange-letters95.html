You are doing such a great service in keeping AAers sober. Thank you so  much.

<p>

And AA is also grateful in keeping you sober. After all, it's primary
purpose is to carry its message to the alcoholic who still  suffers.

Hi JMG,
<p>
Thanks for the note, but I'm not sure that I understand what you are saying. A.A. is not keeping me
sober, so I don't know why it would be grateful about it.
<p>
Perhaps you meant it in a generic sense, that A.A. is grateful in keeping other people sober. --Which it
unfortunately doesn't actually do.
<p>
And A.A.'s real primary purpose seems to be proselytizing and recruiting for a cult religion.
<p>
And you know, I don't claim to be keeping anybody sober, other than myself. I do not claim the sobriety of
my readers. If they are sober, it is because they choose to be, by using their own intelligence and
will power. I don't really have the power to get'em sober, or get'em drunk.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Thank you so much &#8212; this site changed my life.<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

I always loved alcohol. Even as a kid, I remember the smells of coconut rum and
fresh beer. I started drinking early but responsibly. I discovered Scientology in my
early 20's and they frowned on my drinking so I stopped for a few years. I left
Scientology after discovering their manipulative ways and after I accidentally read
their secret materials. I fell in love with drinking again. This time, however, I
seemed to be trying to catch up on the lost years of not drinking in Scientology. I
pretty soon was drinking enormous amounts of alcohol and it effected my physical and
mental health as well as my social life. After 2 years of drinking relentlessly, a
friend refered me to AA. I actually wanted to stop or at least moderate my drinking.

<p>

I should have known the minute I walked into the room. The format was different but
the euphoric feeling of letting go and &quot;sharing&quot; was very similar to episodes I
experienced in Scientology. Red lights and sirens in my mind screaming &quot;MIND
CONTROL&quot; should have come on but they didn't. I was in AA for almost a year. The
manipulation is subtle and all encompassing. I lost friends, distanced myself from
family members who drank (almost everyone in my family drinks) and even restricted
my social life to that of being at work and that of the rooms. I became desperately
unhappy but didn't want to see my doctor as my Higher Power was now my doctor and
besides, my doctor might perscribe antidepressants &#8212; a no no in many AA or NA
groups.

<p>

I was so happy (at first shocked) to stumble across your website. It opened my eyes.
The Truman Show was over! I wasn't powerless. I was the prisoner to alcohol but I
failed to notice I held the key to my cell. I did a great deal of introspection and
yo-yoing to and fro from the rooms. Eventually I let go. I haven't looked back! Some
people in the rooms have refused to accept my absence (I did a lot of work for AA &#8212;
setting up rooms, literature etc) &amp; continue to call me, call by my house
unannounced and even question some of my friends. I have warned AA that they are
harrassing me but I'm told &quot;each group is independant&quot; so I have to inform every
group in my city and area to leave me alone.

<p>

I have discovered that my love of alcohol is genetic. I have joined a gym and now do
extreme sports like whiteriver rafting and skydiving. Doing these things gives me a
thrill and works on my brain chemistry, giving me feelings of elation, satisfaction
&#8212; substituting my need to drink vast amounts of alcohol. I still drink, sometimes
more than I should, but I have discovered that it is not alcohol I crave but
excitement, a thrill, a change in perception and a naughty need to push the limits.
I have lost weight, got a proper 6-pack (not the canned kind) and am incredibly
happy for the first time in years &#8212; almost a year after leaving AA.

<p>

I just want people to know that there are some scary similarities to the techniques
Scientology uses and that of AA. Principly, Scientology relies on confessions
(called auditing). In AA, its called 5th stepping (admiting to another). The effects
at the time of confessionals can be euphoric but the sting in the tail is that once
you have opened yourself up to someone so closely, you are vunerable and open to
blackmail, coersion and deception. Sitting in boring meeting can produce a mind
numbing effect &#8212; and with all those AA slogans bandied about &#8212; a mild form of
hypnotism occurs. There is no question about it: AA is a cult. They might not take
all your money, but they'll get your time, your social life and above all, your
mind.

<p>

Hi Thomas,
<p>
Thank you very much for the letter. It's great.
And thank you for the compliments.
<p>
I've been observing for some time now that there are disturbing
similarities between Scientology and Alcoholics Anonymous, and your experiences confirm that.
<p>
I also believe that my alcoholism is genetic. My father had it before me, and his mother before him...
And I don't know where it came from before that.
<p>
Fortunately, there is one very simple escape for us &#8212; just don't drink alcohol.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	The Cult<br>


<p>

Dear A. Orange,
<p>
Thank-you so much for your research on AA.  I was really relieved to discover
that I am not the only person in the world that feels AA is a cult religion.  I
am still continuing to read the letters and your research regarding AA.
<p>
I am
married to an AA fanatic and we are having problems directly related to AA. The
problems range from my husband spending too much time at meetings, to his
feelings of superiority and his association with complete weirdos in &quot;the
program.&quot;
<p>
My question is, have you heard from many wives or husbands with the
same issues?  Maybe there should be a support group for people in my situation
and I'm not talking about Al-Anon.
<p>
Another question is, have any AA meetings
been abolished anywhere in the world?  Do you think the truth about AA will
ever come out universally?  Will you ever put your research in print?  I would
loveeeeee to put it on my coffee table.
<p>
Enough questions, thanks again.....I'll
continue reading and I'm happy to discover I'm not a freakin nut!
<p>
Liz L. in Maryland

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Liz,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
Unfortunately, your problem is quite common.  I've heard the same story many times.
I'm reminded of a SMART meeting that I was at where two women came in and explained that they
were not alcoholics &#8212; their husbands were &#8212; but was it okay for them to stay anyway?

<p>
We said, &quot;Sure, no problem.&quot;
<p>
Then they told their stories. They could tolerate their husbands' drinking. It wasn't pleasant,
but the situation was tolerable. But when the husbands quit drinking and joined Alcoholics Anonymous
and turned into obsessive true believers in A.A. &#8212; guys whose whole lives were A.A. &#8212;
the women had to divorce them.
Their A.A. behavior was just too much.
<p>
The founder of A.A., Bill Wilson himself, actually bragged about this
in one of his books:
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After the husband joins A.A., the wife may become discontented, even
highly resentful that Alcoholics Anonymous has done the very thing
that all her years of devotion had failed to do.
Her husband may become so wrapped up in A.A. and his new friends
that he is inconsiderately away from home more than when he drank.
Seeing her unhappiness, he recommends A.A.'s Twelve Steps and tries
to teach her how to live.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 118.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Isn't that something else? Bill Wilson assumed that the wife was at fault for disliking her
husband's obsession with A.A., and Bill's answer was for the husband to teach the 12 Steps
to his non-drinking wife &#8212; to &quot;teach her how to live&quot;.
Little wifey-poo should just learn to shut up and quit being
so resentful and join the cult religion and do the 12 Steps too.
<p>
(And notice how the 12 Steps suddenly changed from a quit-drinking program to a religion for
the whole family to live by.)
<p>
Most of the things that you complained about are right there: the condescending
attitude of superiority where the alcoholic is now smarter and wiser than his wife,
the excessive involvement with A.A., and the assumption that there is something wrong
with the wife who never drank to excess.

<p>
There is more discussion of that quote
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#wife_unhappy">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#wife_neglected">here</a>

<p>
I don't know of any &quot;recovery from recovery&quot; self-help organizations, as such, although many
of the alternative recovery groups and organizations actually serve that function to some extent.
A standard feature of organizations like SMART is that people often vent about their
previous experiences in A.A. or Al-Anon, even though that isn't what the organization was designed for.
<p>

You might want to try visiting or communicating with any of the following:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005723/http://www.womenforsobriety.org/">WFS</a> (Women For Sobriety),
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005723/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>,

<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005723/http://www.unhooked.com/index.htm">LifeRing Secular Recovery (LSR)</a>
</ul>

<p>
Only WFS and SMART have actual physical meetings that you can attend. The last two, SOS, and LSR, have
only online meetings. Actually, they all have online meetings, so that is one way to find
kindred spirits around the world.
<p>
And then there are various forums located here and there around the Internet.
Two that come to mind are the Yahoo group called &quot;Twelve-Step Free&quot;:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005723/http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/12-step-free/">here</a>,
and the MSN group &quot;X-steppers&quot;,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005723/http://groups.msn.com/X-STEPPERS/welcome.msnw">here</a>.
You might find some kindred spirits there.
<br>

<p><br>
About your other questions:
<ol>
<li> <i>A.A. meetings abolished anywhere in the world?</i><br>
Not that I know of, other than maybe Red China, because of the religious angle.
I'm not sure what Russia is up to, although I noticed that last year the Moscow mayor's office
downloaded my entire web site. I'm not sure what that's about, but I found it interesting.
<p>
<li> 
<i>Will the truth come out universally?</i><br>
Maybe in another hundred years or so. Old superstitions are as tenacious as cockroaches.
<p>
<li>
<i>The web site in print?</i><br>
Oh, that's so much work. I don't know.
I keep thinking about getting it done, and then I think that it might be more fun to go play
in the sun.

Good luck, and have a good day.

From: Brian T.<br>
Subject: The Funny Spirituality of Bill Wilson and A.A.<br>

<p>

Well if you did your homework about the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous you
would have read the quote &quot;contempt prior to investigation&quot; which is what
you did in
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">this entire article</a>.

<p>

It's really sad that this is your perspective and I am sorry you feel this
way. I suppose I would feel angry as well if I looked at what he wrote in
the aspect you painted.

<p>

You wrote &quot;In the &quot;Big Book&quot;, Alcoholics Anonymous, in the chapter &quot;The
Family Afterward&quot;, on page 135 (3rd and 4th editions), we read&quot;....

<p>

Just so you know... the first 164 pages have never changed unless it refers
the statistics or the forwards. &quot;The Family Afterward&quot; is on the same page
in any edition not just the 3rd and 4th. This also means that all the
dangers of smoking were not even known in 1939. This is just one point, and
trust me there is a much bigger picture here that you completely missed.

<p>

Thanks.  <br>
Sincerely, <br>
A sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Brian,

<p>
You overlook the simple truth that much was known about the harmful effects of tobacco back in 1939.
<p>
It's true that the Surgeon General had not gone on television yet, and declared that cigarette
smoking caused lung cancer, but much was known about the bad health effects of tobacco, and
way before 1939.
Heck, even Mark Twain wrote many jokes about how his doctor ordered him to quit smoking.

<p>
Bill Wilson's wife Lois knew about the bad side of tobacco,
so she was nagging Bill to quit smoking himself to death, as
Bill described in
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">that <i>Big Book</i></a>
story.
<p>
Besides all of that, you are overlooking the most important source of information of all: God.
(That's the &quot;much bigger picture here that you completely missed&quot;.)
God knew about the health damage from tobacco.
God already knew about what tobacco does to people. God didn't have to wait for the U.S. Surgeon
General to tell Him about tobacco.

<p>
Bill Wilson often bragged about how years of practicing the 12 Steps put
the oldtimers in &quot;conscious contact with God&quot;.
And of course Bill implied that he was one of those oh-so-spiritual people.
<p>
That is A.A. Step 11:<br>
<a name="Step11"> </a>
<a name="step11"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="black">
<b>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That leaves us with this logical puzzle:
<p>
<ol>
EITHER:<br>
<li> Step Eleven does not really work, and Bill Wilson never talked with God.
<br>OR:<br>
<li> Bill Wilson deliberately ignored the Voice of God when God told Bill
to quit smoking because smoking is bad for your health. (Just like how
Bill ignored the voice of Lois his wife.)
<br>OR:<br>
<li>
God never told Bill about the dangers of smoking, because God wanted
Bill to die. (Probably for his numerous sins and crimes, like
<a href="orange-heresy.html">heresy</a>
and lying about God and spreading misinformation about alcoholism and
promoting a cult religion and exploiting sick alcoholics, and making money
by misusing the name of God...)
</ol>

<p>
So which is it?
Which one really happened?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	hi.<br>

<p>

ta, very much for your site. i stumbled across it last year, after desperately
trying to find an alternative to aa. when i found your site, i had already stopped
going to aa, knowing that it was damaging, keeping me stuck and very unhappy. i dont
know about anyone else, but after spending nearly eight years of my life in there,
with all these thoughts and questions i had about aa, which people in meetings,
wouldn't and couldn't answer sensibly, the relief i felt, after i started reading was
enormous. because at that time the fear and paranoia i had, especially about my
decision to leave aa, was overwhelming.
<p>
please believe me, your site was a great
comfort to me. i remember thinking at last, an actual voice of reason. all the
things i had been trying to articulate myself, but had been told by my fellow
members for years that i was rebellious, resistant, not grateful enough, my ongoing
depression, which i may add people were sympathetic to at first, but over the years,
and this is standard aa, that empathy runs out, and to be told countless times when
i was on my knees that it was because i had not fully let god into my heart, i had
not dealt with my past, more inventory, etc. i am sure you get the drift.
<p>
the relief
i now feel to actually not go to meetings anymore is wonderful. i shudder at the
thought of ever stepping through those so called magical doors again. what was also
good at the time, was my friend, another aa member was also feeling the same, and
had done the same as myself. he also read your site, and would say lol, i have been
saying that for years.

<p>

i feel like touching on so much that you
have said about aa. but your ultimate message is yes, aa is dangerous. you are
absolutely right, yes we are dealing with people, who have suffered many terrible
kinds of abuse, mental disorders, acts of violence, rape, incest, murder and as you
say, this aa, is not a place for quack, pap, nonsense, led by people who are
absolutely in no way qualified or have any business to be even thinking about trying
to be dealing with such complex, life and death matters. its downright dangerous and
fills me with anger that they go on and on, through the years, unquestioned and
unexamined. if it was any other medical condition, it would have been shut down
years ago. its like a fake doctor, sitting in some practise, with a forged medical
licence. it really should be investigated. i have seen first hand and know many
people, including myself, who while very vulnreable, have literally placed our lives
in the hand of these people, and the twelve steps, to not only become more sicker,
drink more, end up in mental institutions, with terrible breakdowns and suicides,
because of what aa promates as "good for your so-called health".

<p>

i had
noticed many years ago, that a lot of people, who were, so-called long term members,
were all still struggling, depressed or wearing the mask of aas happy, contented and
sober badge, but were really still in terrible amounts of pain. i thought many
times, no one really seems to get better in here, and the contradiction of well if
you were one of the contented sober folks, then they had not really been true
alcoholics in the first place. there is such a lack of anything other than aa. its
promoted everywhere and unfortunately has become synomous with sobriety. i live in
scotland, so it was very interesting to read the way aa has infiltrated american
society, from your court and prison systems, doctors, hospitals and rehabs. it has
not taken root as much as that in britain, and i hope it never does. i forgot to
mention churches as well.
<p>
your site is fantastic. its well written and researched, refreshing and very funny.
your sense of humour had me laughing out loud. the chapters on deprograming your
mind and the lizard brain monster are clear and insightful. just good, no nonsense,
mumbo jumbo. but what i have found most interesting is your letters page. it just
reinforces to me, from the letters you get from people still in aa, that it does
not work, does not make any sense, now i am away from meetings that is becoming
clearer by the day.
<p>
thanks again.
<p>
thanks for reinforcing that you can be happy without aa and that your site will go
on and on helping the many confused and unhappy people in aa, who go around asking
and raising these questions and please believe i know many, when they read your
site, they will also realise that they are not insane, lowlife human beings, who
will have to endure a life squeezed out of them by aa.
<p>
ta. its great. keep up the good work.

<p>

Hello Orange............
<p>
AA in Scotland is as Nutty &amp; dis-functional  as it is
in the USA &amp; elsewhere.
Cults the World Over have 2 things in
Common......... FEAR &amp; CONTROL  (as do World Goverments), but sticking  to the AA
Cult, most
Women &amp; Men come to AA as damaged goods, and with many  Human Problems.
i say
Human Problems because i am not that very differant to the  rest of the Human
Race, when i as an Individual stopped drinking, i was young  when i stopped
drinking, and have been sober now over 25years ODAAT, and i DONT  have a &quot;ISM&quot;
problem, I NEVER had &amp; NEVER will.
<p>
Once i stopped taking the  drink, i knew i
had other Human Problems, and as the years have gone by, i have  just had to
deal with my Human Problems, just like the Rest of The Human Race,  But i REFUSE
to bow to the AA Cult &amp; those who would &quot;try&quot; &amp; Control  me &amp; put the AA FEAR
into my Life.
<p>
i dont buy this  A.A.'s  &quot;higher  powers&quot; , i do Believe in God,
i believe i was  given Free Will , and i will make my own choices &amp; mistakes
etc as a  Human being, its called learning and growing up, and having fun, and
if i cant  do some one a good turn, dont do them a bad turn.
<p>
I dont do DEAD
Americans &#8212; Bill  Wilson or Dr. Bob Smith.
i have met in AA and  outside of AA (yes,  there is a BIG WORLD outside of AA) many who are Brain DEAD, and the AA
Cult  takes over that type of individual who is frightened to think or act or
feel for themselves.
<p>
They have a &quot;LIVE &amp; Let Live Notice&quot; in many AA  meetings,
i think this ONE is definitely a Joke  ............ Dont try to be an
Individual in AA or the Cult will come for yous. Be Your OWN Man or Woman in This
Life, Life is to short for BILL Wilson to be doing my thinking for me from
Beyond the Grave.........

I got sober in AA

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Kebmo,
<p>
I got sober in the streets and in a shelter for homeless men. So should we declare that the
streets and homeless shelters are great programs for sobriety?
Shouldn't we give all credit for sobriety to the streets?

<p>
That's the problem with
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>.
Just because somebody got sober <i><b>in</b></i> a certain place does not mean that he got sober
<b><i>because of</i></b> that place.
<p>
And just because somebody got sober <i><b>in or near</b></i> some A.A.
meetings does not mean that he got sober
<b><i>because of</i></b> those A.A. meetings.

<p>
The way to figure out whether people quit drinking because of a certain thing or program
is to do good, medically-valid, carefully-controlled studies.
Such studies have been done to test whether Alcoholics Anonymous
works to make people quit drinkings, and A.A. flunked the test every time. It didn't work.
Look

Have a good day.

<p>

you're wrong. the folks who do not recover do not &quot;thoroughly follow&quot; the path, a
process understood through experience only. You are inside the last paradigm forming
judgements. the earth is not flat.<br>
lucius

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Lucius,
<p>
Sorry, but you are just repeating a standard A.A. word game. The &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;
phrase is just an excuse to cover up total failure.  A.A. <i>always</i> shoves the blame for
failure back onto the alcoholics by claiming that they didn't &quot;work the program right&quot; or
&quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;.

<p>
But it's a circular self-referential definition, which is very bad logic.
If someone quits drinking, then the other
A.A. members declare that he <i>DID</i> &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;, and if someone does not
quit drinking, then the A.A. members declare that he <i>DID NOT</i> &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;.

<p>
So of course it appears that 100% of those who did &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot; quit drinking.<br>
And 100% of those who quit drinking did &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;.

<p>
But that is still a meaningless word game.
There is no evidence that &quot;thoroughly following our path&quot; actually makes alcoholics quit drinking.
<p>
I can use the same word game to proclaim that I have a never-fails diet plan:
<ol>
<li> Instead of eating, dance around in a ballerina's tutu.
<li> When you get really hungry, go jogging and then eat a celery stick.
<li> Pray to the Great God Lard-Ass to have Him remove your excess pounds and your desire to eat.
</ol>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i><b>NEVER</b></i> have I seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed my path.  If somebody
doesn't lose weight, then he or she didn't thoroughly follow my path enough.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the other thing that is missing from your statement
is a success rate.  What is the actual A.A. success rate?<br>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year medallion a year later?<br>
That's the number that really counts.<br>
And how many will get 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.

<p>
Your last phrase,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;a process understood through experience only&quot;,
</font>
is standard cult fare.
Cults routinely make claims like that:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Only another group member can understand. Outsiders don't understand this at all. They
can't begin to know how wonderful this all is. They think they know something, but they don't.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Just proclaim that you have some magical secret mystical thing that the outsiders cannot
understand, because they haven't done the cult's practices long enough,
or prayed enough, or chanted enough, or meditated enough, or been
&quot;audited&quot; enough, or worked the steps enough. That is pure B.S.
<p>
I clearly understand the A.A. failure rate.<br>
I also clearly understand the mental changes and the feelings that people go through as they get
brainwashed into becoming true believers in a cult.<br>
See these cult test items:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">12. The cult and its members are special.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality">7. Irrationality.</a>

Your website is amazing!

<p>

I had a friend from Nigeria, tell me about it, she's a nurse and quit
drinking on her own here in San Jose. She told me AA was harmful and at
first I could not believe her until I read your site.

<p>

She told me about your site.<br>
Kudos for an amazing job you have done.

<p>

have you ever read the site that belongs to the Hypoglycemia Assoc of

They have a lot of Articles on their site that explain the causes (and cures

&quot;Clinical nutrition is an evidence-based medical science, supported by

<p>
&quot;It is recognised that psychological problems such as anxiety, stresses
of life, depression, unhappy personal relationships, uncontrollable anger
and frustration may weaken the immune system and thus cause the many
physical ailments. Thus this web site has a folder offering several
articles on practical self-help PSYCHOTHERAPY which will help people to
overcome these problem, once they have repaired the original metabolic
disorder. This is particularly useful with such diseases as Anxiety,
Aggressive Behaviour, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Alcoholism and Drug
Addiction, Chronic Depression, which are usually influenced by both
nutritional and psychological (attitudinal) factors.<br>
The psychotherapy folder starts with treatment of a negative self-image,
which is seen as the hub of personality disorders.&quot;

It sure looks worth checking out.

<p>
What a fabulous job you have done. Must

I been reading Orange-papers for about 5 years and help me a lot to get my life and
myself back. I have read some of the deprogramming part.
<p>
It takes some time for me to read the papers because my english isn't so good. As

and I wrote the guy and he wrote
me back and he asked me if I knew any critical Xa website here in Scandinavian, but I
don't. Swedish, Norwegian and Danish language reminds about each other. It took me a

??? You bring out a lot of good points in your critique of AA/treatment. It seems
that your personal experience may have been worse than some people's right from the
start (ie: the counselor at your treatment facility. Sounds like a real nutball!) I
think that AA does offer some help, as you mention yourself. It also provides a
cover for some real predators. An upfront warning about the downside is a good idea
for &quot;newcomers&quot; but I have the feeling that many in AA are inclined to fit right in
to the atmosphere that you describe. I am really against the courts ordering people
to attend meetings as they do. Truthfully though, many attending a few meetings
might benefit from seeing what goes on at meetings. It might help them decide to
quit drinking in order to avoid turning into the people they see there!

<p>

I stay involved in AA to a slight degree just to go and get things off my chest and
to refute some of the more outrageous stuff.

<p>

For the rest I think it gives some a sense of belonging that they might not get
anywhere else. And of course as you point out it gives others a platform to prey on
the troubled. Maybe focusing more on the alternative groups that you mention might
be helpful. Good luck with your sobriety!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Torchtip,
<p>
You sound like another member of the
&quot;<a href="orange-letters30.html#Rescue_League">Newcomer Rescue League</a>&quot;.
That is a mythical
secret society of sane people who go to A.A. meetings to rescue the occasional newcomer
from the nut-case sponsors.
<p>
Yes, I know about that sense of belonging, and that sense of comradery, and the enthusiasm
and <i>esprit de corps</i> that you can sometimes find at an A.A. or N.A. meeting. I've often
felt like that could have been a very good thing, and a very powerful thing. It really is a shame
that there is so much toxic stuff that comes along with it &#8212; stuff that makes alcoholics
relapse or even commit suicide.
<p>
At times I've wondered if it might be possible to put together a benign sobriety cult
that would help people more than it hurt them. Unfortunately, the answer seems to be &quot;No.&quot;
The cultishness itself becomes the problem.

I had read a news article about Bill W. asking for booze on his deathbed and getting
pissed at the nurses when they refused. Have you seen that or referenced it here in
your site?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. That comes from Susan Cheever's biography of Bill Wilson, <i>&quot;My Name is Bill&quot;</i>.
(It is described in the bibliography,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Cheever">here</a>.)
<p>
Susan Cheever is one of those people who can be trusted to not let the cat out of the bag,
so she was allowed into the locked and sealed A.A. historical archives, and
was able to read the real historical documents, like the
log-book of the male nurse who tended Bill Wilson on his deathbed.
It describes how Bill Wilson threatened to
punch the nurse out when he refused to supply Bill with whiskey.
<p>
I wrote about that before, and printed a quotation in a previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Cheever_book">here</a>.

<p>
In spite of the fact that Susan Cheever revealed two juicy tidbits about Bill Wilson &#8212;
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever6">Bill's sexual predations</a>
and his deathbed demands for whiskey &#8212;
her book is otherwise a white-wash and a cover-up, and another
fawning glorification of Bill Wilson.  Cheever did such
a good job of it that her reward was that she was then elected to Board
of Directors of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency
&#8212; the NCADD &#8212; the A.A. front group that was founded by
&quot;Mrs.&quot; Marty Mann to promote Alcoholics Anonymous.

Obviously you can not understand the concept of surrender in order to comprehend the
significance you have to experience both alcoholism and surrender. You my friend
have not experieced surrender. I'd also like for you to show me a cult, or any other
organization that limits the amount of financial contributions it's members can give
per year with name attached. Had you hung around long enough you may have
surrendered...untill then I wish you well.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rob,
<p>
Actually, I do understand the concept of surrender. I also understand ego loss.
I also know that it is possible to be confused about the issue, and
to make a false surrender.
<p>
Two good questions to ask are, &quot;What is the fruit of this labor?&quot; and
&quot;What do you do after the surrender?&quot;
<p>
A surrender that leads to foisting ineffective quack medicine on sick people and deceiving them
about how well it works is not a good surrender.
I cannot say for sure what such a person surrendered his soul to in order to do that, but I know
that it wasn't good.

<p>
The concept of surrender is often confused in cults, and is often turned into a demand for obedience
and conformity.

faith and trust &#8212; to a method such as a guru only when such faith
resonates with truth at the depths of one's being. Then there is a
readiness for such opening. If one is still rooted only in intellect
or emotion, any act of surrender is but another act of ego and
can, based on misjudgment, lead to horrendous consequences. So one
cannot <i>choose</i> to surrender to the guru. But when the devotee
and the guru have met at the depths of being then such surrender
is not actually surrender to another person but, rather, surrender
to one's own God-nature.<br>

To repeat, you cannot <i>choose</i> to surrender. If you do
surrender while you are still &quot;wearing your ego&quot;,
then it becomes just some more egotism:

&quot;Look at me. <i>I'm</i> one of the special people who
is doing the will of God.
<i>I've</i> surrendered to God, and you haven't,
so <i>I'm</i> more spiritual than you are. So there.&quot;

As far as the limitation on donations goes, that is a good point. That is one way in
which Alcoholics Anonymous is different from Scientology. That makes A.A. a slightly
different kind of cult.  Not all cults are out to get all of your money, you know.
Some just want your heart, your mind, your soul, and your life.

<p>
So the neighborhood A.A. meeting will not take all of your money. But the neighborhood
12-Step-based treatment center will. And then they will send you to an A.A. meeting.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange,
<p>
Good to see up-dates on your site. As I've written in the past,
I am over 30 years sober and left AA several years ago to live a sober
life without the cult AA.
<p>
AA occupied so much of my time as I had gone to
AA in my 20's and was convinced that I owed my sobriety and my life,
time and energy to AA. I know now how untrue all of that is and am so
glad people are being warned about AA. If loved ones of alcoholics really
knew the number of court-ordered criminals and sexual predators in those
meetings they would not be so quick to send their loved ones there.
<p>
And there
is also the matter of members being encouraged to leave their partners
and go with someone on the program. You are told, it is just easier to go
with someone on the program who understands you. All those outside of AA
are called normies in a very condescending way.
<p>
Keep up your positive contribution to the truth.
<p>
Sherwoode
