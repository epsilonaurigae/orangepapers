Subject:  	Are their any secular support groups instead of Al-Anon?<br>

<P>
Hello!

<P>
Thanks for such an informative web site.  Keep up the good work!

<P>
Do you happen to know if there are any secular support groups for families or
friends of persons who are addicted to alcohol?

<P>
If you do know, could you email me back with some suggestions?

<P>
Thanks!

<P>

<P>
<font color="blue">
Hello Katherine,
<P>
Thank you for the compliments and the question. That is a tough one. I don't know of a group that
exactly matches your description &#8212; secular family-of-alcoholics support group.
<P>
But I have seen that family members do visit the secular alcoholics' support groups.
I've personally seen a couple of women come to a SMART meeting and explain that
they were not alcoholics, they were wives of alcoholics, but was it okay if they
attended anyway? We said, &quot;Sure, no problem.&quot; And those were the women who went
on to explain that they were actually ex-wives. They had tolerated their husbands
drinking for years, but when the husbands sobered up and joined A.A. and became
crazy true believers who devoted their entire lives to A.A., that was just too much and
the women divorced them.
<P>
So the women were attending meetings like SMART to see what else there was
for recovery besides becoming religious nutcases.
<P>
My suggestion is to check out the usual secular support groups like SMART, SOS,
and Lifering. You will probably find a lot of kindred spirits. Many, many alcoholics
were also children of alcoholics, or relatives of alcoholics in other ways,
so the issues that they face are often the same as the ones that you face.
I just reprinted the list of secular groups again,
<a href="orange-letters177.html#alt_list" target="_blank">here</a>.
I would also get into a bunch of those online forums and ask there. If someone
has not started a secular family support group, they should.

<P>
Have a good day now.

I was thinking about you this morning because my household financial circumstances
have improved recently and I would like to make a donation towards the cost of
keeping your site online, and that includes after your death, or my death.  Do you
feel that the future of your site is in any danger due to financial restraints?  Do
you have an 'heir', so to speak?  I feel that your site is so important that I would
like to know that its ongoing presence online is assured.  It is my impression that
anyone who speaks against the 12 step movement links to the ops, for its references
apart from anything else; we need the ops to have a permanent net presence. I will
donate via paypal, but if the financial future of the site is in any danger at all
(and let me know about ideological difficulties too, I would take a more long term
view.  I hear you had a problem with aol which was eventually sorted).  I will make
a modest donation via paypal, but I am thinking in terms of my will.

<P>
<font color="blue">
Hi X,
<P>
It's good to hear from you again.
<P>
The way things are now, when I die, the web site dies. I have given official permission
for anybody to mirror the site after I'm dead, but I think &#8212; hope &#8212; maybe we
can do better than that. We were just talking about that in a previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters171.html#legacy" target="_blank">here</a>.
Having a small group of moderators who manage the forums will supply some live
bodies to keep things going.
<P>
In the long run, perhaps incorporation as a foundation is necessary. I don't think
you can bequeath money to a dead person, or to a dead person's web site.
<P>
Anybody got any ideas?

I urge you to register with the Guardian newspaper in the UK (free and fairly easy),
which has the largest net profile of all UK papers. They regularly have a thread
called, 'What do you want to talk about?', where people send in suggestions which
are regularly used.  You will get a very very big audience.  If I were someone as
articulate as you, I would wait until they start the 'WDYWTTA' thread and jump in
with the first comment, to get maximum readership.  But please just try it now,
because they have one going at the moment.

<P>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes, the Guardian. I'm already registered with them. I like them. I like to
frequent foreign newspapers because they will tell the truths that the American
newspapers won't. Like did you know that Greg Palast could get his stories of
corruption in the Florida elections in 2000 &#8212; purging of qualified black voters
because they had names that merely resembled felons &#8212; printed and broadcast by
the BBC in London, but neither the New York Times nor the Washington Post would
print the stories?


</font>
<P>
3.  I agree that 'The ineffectiveness of the 12 steps' is the best starting point.
It says it all.

<P>
4.  I sent some bits from 'Stinkin' thinkin'' to Private Eye, but more from a
humorous point of view than anything else.

<P>
5.  I am thinking of Mark Thomas and Dave Gorman in the UK, both stand up comedians
who either take on heavy issues or question sacred cows.

<P>
6.  Please write something for the Guardian.  Or look at Mumsnet (both UK sites;
both read  by lots of people, both free to all.  Please try mumsnet; they have a
powerful and very (good for us) argumentative membership.

<P>
<font color="blue">
Okay, I'll have to work on that.

</font>
<P>
7. I have also been considering writing to British medical insurers; BUPA, Norwich
Union, etc, enclosing 'TEOTTS'. What do you think of this angle? The Priory does not
have shareholders.  I rang a couple of 'treatment' facilities for my fictional
alcoholic brother and I was told that he was in denial.  I asked their success rates
and they very proudly told me 65%, but on closer questionning, the 65% meant that
65% had lasted the residential course.

<P>
<font color="blue">
I think that is a very good angle. I cannot think of another area of modern medicine
where quackery is acceptable. Try billing the health insurance companies for
treating cancer with colloidal gold, arsenic, and prayer, and see how much money you get.
And yet the insurance companies pay for 12-Step religion every day.

</font>
<P>
8.  I am also very wary of putting my head above the parapet.

<P>
All the best.

Hi Agent Orange,
<P>
Thank you soooo much for making your website. It is so amazing and helpful. I used
to be in AA and after being raped by my boyfriend, who was of course in the program
as well, and having all of my AA friends turn their back on me, I have condemned AA.
I am now in college in a sexuality class and have to write a paper and do a
presentation on a subject of my choice involving sex.

<P>
I have decided to present about sex in recovery and I would like to know if you have
any particular articles that may be helpful or know of any videos I could use. I
will of course continue to look through on your site and others but it seems that
the search engine on your site does not work so that makes things a little tricky.
<P>
Thanks a lot hope you are having a great day!

Hello Alicia,
<P>
Thank you for all of the compliments. Sorry to take so long to answer; boy did this
letter get misplaced. I just found another bundle of letters that got stashed and
forgotten many months ago. I got kind of disorganized when I was moving to a new home.
<P>
I cannot think of anything special that you haven't probably already found.
The stories about sexual exploitation are just getting to be so commonplace.
<P>
First off, of course, there are the really outrageous groups like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Mike Quinones'
&quot;Midtown Group&quot; in Washington DC</a>.
The list that is linked there also lists several other groups around
the country.
<P>
And then there are the stories of sexual exploitation in
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="_blank">the list of A.A. horror stories</a>.
<P>
Oh, and that &quot;Entropy&quot; search engine (at the bottom of all of the web pages)
does work, sort of.  It just isn't very easy to use.
All that it does is give you the URL of the web page where something is found, and
then reprint the top few lines of the file, which have nothing to do with what
you were searching for. So what you have to do is open the page, and use the web
browser's built-in search function (usually a slash '/') to search within the web page
to get to what you really want.

<P>
Anyway, you have probably finished the paper and graduated by now, right?
<P>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

*Subject:  * 	Webmaster<br>
*From:  * 	GC<br>
<P>
Dear Webmaster:

<P>
I am SO glad to have come across you website.  Your information just REASSURED me
that what I was thinking was correct.

<P>
I was FORCED by the mental health system attend AA/NA meetings because of a
prescription drug problem, which I have successfully (and gladly) been cured.  My
problem was the 'detox.'  The detox symptoms were so great that I never could fully
make it though the withdrawal and would just give in and take my prescribed and
narcotic medication.  It wasn't that I just didn't want to quit.

<P>
It had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with &quot;character defects&quot; as AA/NA preaches.  I am so
happy to be clean and it has NOTHING to do with AA/NA.
I totally IGNORED the AA/NA teachings, and felt like I was being FORCED to attend a
meeting with some strange cult.

<P>
If people THINK that AA/NA is NOT a cult, just try to disagree with one of the
members at a meeting!  They will NOT speak to you, and totally ostracize you; they
may even ask you not to come back.

<P>
I feel like &quot;who the heck is this Bill W. and what makes HIM the final authority on
addiction &amp; recovery?&quot;  I always had a problem with saying &quot;My name is bla bla bla
and I'm an addict,&quot;  because I felt that I was cured of drug dependency, as I have
NO DESIRE to get back on addictive prescription medication that I was taking before.
I am only too happy to be off the medication.  However, AA/NA was always trying to
&quot;correct&quot; me by saying I would never be cured, and that is absolutely ridiculous.

<P>
They even corrected me at a meeting when I was forced by a drug counselor to speak
about my problems.  I introduced myself (as I was made to do) by saying my name and
that I was an &quot;addict.&quot;  Anyway, it turned out that I was approached by the chair of
the meeting and asked that in the future would I please identify myself as an
&quot;alcoholic.&quot;  I answered VERY quickly and said that I would certainly mind, because
I hate alcohol, had maybe 3 drinks (which I practically wasted since I only took a
sip or two) my entire life, and that I didn't have a problem with alcohol and would
not introduce myself that way.  This woman actually had the audacity to ask me to
LIE and say that I was ANYWAY out of &quot;respect for the meeting.&quot;  Have you ever heard
of something so crazy????  I basically told her that I WOULD NOT lie, and that I
just wouldn't speak, no matter what, in one of their meetings from then on, no
matter what the drug counselor said I had to do.

<P>
Being in the psychiatric nursing field (I have been a nurse for approximately 20
years), I can tell you that they INCORRECTLY use the terms &quot;adverse reaction&quot; and
&quot;allergy.&quot;  An adverse reaction is NOT defined in the manner of which THEY use it,
and neither is allergy.

<P>
I actually had several people in AA/NA tell me that I was WRONG when I told them
that there were certain dynamics of:  relationships/problems/issues that a person
needed to see a professional (counselor, therapist, psychiatrist, etc etc) about,
because a &quot;sponsor&quot; is not qualified to address those issues.  They continued to
argue with me until finally I just gave up.  HOW could they actually think an
unqualified &quot;sponsor&quot; (who is nothing more than a former alcoholic or addict
themselves) could be BETTER than someone with schooling specially geared to that
specific issue?

<P>
These people are OUT OF THEIR MINDS.  I am college educated man, and it was only too
apparent to me that this is CLEARLY a cult organization of the first rank.

<P>
Because of my occupation, I have seen many 12 step programs, and worked loosely with
them through clients.  I find it sad that mental health facilities are being
increasingly and WRONGLY more reliant on these 12 step programs.  I am seeing the
trend swing towards 12 step programs the longer that I nurse, it is disgusting.  I
had NO IDEA that these programs were like this until I was forced to attend them.
It makes me ill to know that all the patients I was working with also being forced
to attend 12 step programs and on top of that, were being subjected to this against
their will.  Apparently the majority of the public is unaware of what a cult these
programs really are.  People in mental hospitals, chemical dependency centers, and
the court system SHOULD NOT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM be forced to join a religion.
And I am a devoutly religious man.  But it is a religion of my choosing, not one
forced upon me by a health care system/court system.

<P>
Because I was forced through a chemical dependency program to attend these crazy
meetings, I was able to see EXACTLY what you are speaking about.

<P>
They continue to make the members state things like &quot;my name is John Doe, and I'm an
alcoholic&quot; which ONLY REINFORCES to the client that they will NEVER RECOVER!  THAT
IS NOT NORMAL!  THAT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO TRUE RECOVERY.

<P>
I could go on &amp; on &amp; on &amp; on, but it literally makes me sick to my stomach to even
discuss this very sick program.

<P>
Thanks so much for all the WONDERFUL information that you have provided.  It is
CERTAINLY the truth.

<P>
God bless you friend,

<P>
Regards,

<P>

Hello GC,
<P>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. You make a lot of good points, and I
couldn't agree more.
<P>
We were just talking about that &quot;I am an alcoholic&quot; problem a few letters
back,
<a href="orange-letters174.html#I_am" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters158.html#Gaskin" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters8.html#Gaskin" target="_blank">here</a>.
It is very unhealthy to spend years labeling yourself as an alcoholic or an addict.
And of course recovery is possible. Obviously, there comes a day when it is
time to change the rap to, &quot;Hi. My name is Terry, and I used to drink too much,
but that was many years ago, and now I'm doing other things with my life. Want to
hear how I quit drinking and changed my life?&quot;

<P>
It is some kind of national crime for A.A. and N.A. to dominate the drug and alcohol
recovery business (which is what it is &#8212; the business of selling cult religion and
quack medicine to sick people).

<P>
Have a good day now.

Thank you for your response.  I copied and pasted over 600 pages of your work, that

I chose to not drink and I chose to do that wihout a &quot;program&quot;.  My boyfriend told

&quot;Sponsee&quot;!  (aargh)  I truly appreciate your research and your view as I feel very
much the same.  It is very difficult to be in a serious relationship with someone
who lives by his 12-step program every day and attends a meeting of some sort every
day.  He gets all this recognition, support and celebration because he made a choice
not to drink.  Sometimes I just want to celebrate me.  Grrr.  Anyway, thanks again

Hello again, Shannon,
<P>
Sorry to hear about your difficult relationship.
Yes, being in a relationship with somebody who drank the koolaid is really tough.
But it sounds like you are at least taking care of your own health &#8212;
both physical health and mental health.
<P>
So have a good day now.

Hello again,

There is a site called orange-papers.com that is pro AA. The bastards are trying to
divert people from your site to a misleading one. In the future I will have to be
much more careful when I refer people to your site for help.

<P>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Gene,
<P>
Yes, that is a copycat web site. Just an attempt to keep people from seeing the Orange Papers.
Really spiritual behavior, huh?

UPDATE: Summer 2013: The domain name <i>orange-papers.com</i> became available, so I quickly registered it.
Now that name just redirects to <i>orange-papers.info</i>.
For the last few years, the owner of <i>orange-papers.com</i> neglected the web site,
and didn't update it, and let it die.
No wonder why. It got no traffic. Google was still directing all of the traffic to my site.
So now I have the name <i>orange-papers.com</i> , and that prevents any copycat web sites with that name.
I also got <i>orange-papers.net</i> and <i>orangepapers.net</i> while I was at it, and they also

Hello,

<P>
I have a deep outrage against Bill Wilson's AA. I am a Christian and know what
a pack of lies he has handed us. Thanks to this site I can help others whose
faith has been poisoned by
that lunatic. Everything good about Christianity has been turned upside down by AA.

<P>
In that people like me who are dedicated to Jesus often get slammed by ex-AA people
because of a resemblance in our beliefs. Now I have to deal with programed knee-jerk
reactions people have against God because of Wilson's treachery. I have a few
Christian anti-AA sites to share with anyone interested. Wilson came not to help,
but to destroy. I am looking into his so called treatment by the then Nazi
psychiatrist Carl Jung. Also I have read of possible contact by Wilson with the
satanist Aleister Crowley. That info came from sparklesdelicious website. It is
possible Wilson met both individuals in Germany. Perhaps he did not go for
&quot;treatment&quot; but for instruction and collaboration. I do not believe Wilson could
have done all this on his own. There is a striking similarity between the Big Book
and &quot;The Diary Of A Dope Fiend. This may take awhile to track all this down with my
limited resources.

<P>
Remember that the triangle in the circle is an occult symbol used to summon demonic
entities. It is also Luciferian in the Masonic symbols. I believe there is more to
this picture than just Bill's hocus pocus.

<P>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it is amazing that they declare that A.A. is completely compatible with Christianity,
or even &quot;based on the Bible&quot;.

I'm still looking for where it says in the Bible that you can worship anything as
your &quot;Higher Power&quot; &#8212;
Jesus, Golden Calf, Group Of Drunks, or Beelzebub...
They are all the same and anything is okay, right?

<P>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

There isn't really any such thing as a &quot;dry drunk&quot;, and going to an A.A. meeting is
not the answer to emotional problems.

</font>
</blockquote>

<P>
I have to guess that your husband quit drinking, and now he is angry a lot of the time.
That is actually rather normal. I went through a lot of that too, for years after
quitting drinking.  Alcohol makes major changes to the brain, and it takes
years to heal and repair the damage. And then there is the problem
of all of the original causes of drinking that never got resolved.
Like, was he an abused child? That is good for many years of residual anger.
<P>
I recommend a couple of things:
<P>
<ol>
<LI> B Vitamins. Actually, all vitamins. That is, get a good high-potency
one-a-day &quot;everything&quot; vitamin pill, and also a good high-potency
B-complex with C pill. Personally, I take Centrum Silver, B-Complex,
more C, Calcium, and aspirin, twice a day. The B vitamins help the brain
to heal sooner &#8212; they really help a lot.
The calcium is for osteoporosis, which alcohol can
cause, too. The aspirin is for blood thinning, and the pain of arthritis, and
to prevent headaches. After living on a liquid diet for many
years, my body can easily feel dehydrated when I'm not constantly guzzling something wet,
so thinning the blood is a good thing.

<P><LI>
Try some counseling. I have mixed feelings about counseling, personally. Some counselors
are blithering idiots &#8212; the blind leading the blind. But if you get lucky, you might
find a good one who can help him to sort out his feelings and overcome some of the anger.

<P><LI>
Try some meditation. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or formal. Just five or ten minutes
of calming down and centering each morning can make a big difference. Have him try just
a five-minute session of &quot;For the next five minutes, I will calm down and not be angry.
For the next five minutes, I will think happy thoughts.&quot;
It works.
<P>
Then, if he can increase it to 15 minutes or more every morning, it becomes very powerful.

<P><LI>
Also, I wrote about emotional recovery at the end of that &quot;Dry Drunk&quot; web page,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#emotional_recovery" target="_blank">here</a>.
There you have a few more suggestions for how to overcome the residual anger.


</ol>

<P>
Good luck. And have a good day.

Subject:  	There is a cure for alcoholism called naltrexone<br>

<P>
Hello:

<P>
Thank you for your fantastic site.  I agree that AA is complete
bullshit.

<P>
Making matters worse, AA is actively interfering with new,
revolutionary methods for combatting alcoholism that work.  Nine
months ago I was a raging alcoholic, binge drinker who tossed down
about fifty drinks a week over the course of three nights.  I then
read about a drug called Naltrexone in the New York Times.  The
article is here.

<P>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/health/12bside.html">
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/health/12bside.html</a>

<P>
Naltrexone has previously been marketed as an anti-craving drug used
with abstinence.  It failed miserably when used this way and therefore
has a bad reputation in the medical community.

<P>
The correct way to take the drug is with continued drinking &#8212; taking
the pill one hour before consumption.  The pill alters the buzz and
basically eliminates the positive reinforcement for drinking.  I am
part of a support network located at
<a href="http://www.thesinclairmethod.com" target="_blank">www.thesinclairmethod.com</a>.
My handle there is Minneapolisnick.
<P>
 After nine months of taking
naltrexone before I drink I am cured of my alcoholism and no longer
crave alcohol.  Dozens of people at our site are either cured entirely
of their alcoholism or have their consumption and craving for alcohol
drastically reduced thanks to taking naltrexone one hour before they
drink.

<P>
My beef with AA is that they are literally killing thousands of people
by preventing people from discovering medical solutions for alcoholism
that actually work.

<P>
Thank you for your great work.

<P>
Sincerely,

<P>

but it sounds very good. The way I see it is, &quot;Whatever works. The more tools we can

By the way, I see that you are a lawyer. Ever considered suing A.A. for medical malpractice?
Or for negligent treatment of sick people, or depraved indifference, or

Subject:  	My take on AA's &quot;success&quot;<br>

<P>
Defenders of AA are always telling me, &quot;It has done wonders for so
many people!&quot; And my response is this: NO IT DIDN'T. Our incredible
instinct for survival and inherent need to escape a miserable life of
alcoholism is the driving force behind the sobriety. I'm quite
convinced that if alcoholics were not railroaded into AA but instead
were directed to witchcraft/voodoo classes, that an equal number of
people would be able to maintain their sobriety by sticking pins in
their voodoo dolls. Desperate times call for desperate measures! If
you had told me at my low point of boozing that standing upside down
naked on top of the Empire State building while reciting the Koran
would stop me from drinking, I would have tried it. And I probably
would have maintained my sobriety about as long as your average AAer
with that strategy. And then all of mainstream society would be
declaring, &quot;It's amazing what standing upside down naked on the Empire
State building while reciting the Koran can do to help people stop
drinking.&quot;

<P>
<font color="blue">
I quite agree. A.A. just claims those few people who sober themselves up, while
ignoring and not counting the great numbers of people who don't quit drinking.
(<i>&quot;They didn't work the program right. They didn't
thoroughly follow our path. They didn't really try.&quot;</i>)

<P>
I often joke about my quack cures, like The Baskin-Robbins Cure, or The Ballerina Dancing
Cure, or The Patty-Cake Treatment Program, or the Tiddly-Winks Treatment Program,
but they aren't entirely a joke.
Truth is, I'd be happy to participate in a real scientific experiment, a valid
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</a>,
to test one of those cures against Alcoholics Anonymous.
I'd happily teach the Patty-Cake Treatment Program,
or the Tiddly-Winks Cure, and I'm sure that I can match or beat the success rate of
any program that is based on Alcoholics Anonymous and the Twelve Steps.
And I'm sure that we will have a lower suicide rate, too.
And besides that, we will be very &quot;Spiritual&quot;.

Have a good day.

This is one of those photographs where I just missed some great shots. These adults were very
upset about the dog, because their babies were there, just off-screen to the left, in the water.
The parents were honking angrily. Then they started thinking, &quot;That is just a small dog, and
there are more of us than there are of him.&quot; They actually psyched themselves up, honking
louder and louder, and faster and faster, and then the two ganders suddenly attacked the dog,
biting and screeching and whipping it with their wings. The dog freaked out and ran.
Then the geese proudly reclaimed the beach.
<P>
I had never seen the geese attack anybody or anything like that before.
Canada Geese are normally very mellow and easy-going (unlike the white domestic geese).
But then again, Canada Geese really don't like dogs.
(It's a very old adversarial relationship: Wolves and coyotes and foxes have been eating
geese and goslings for millions of years, and both the geese and the dogs know it.)

Hi,

<P>
This is an excellent article from 1963. I could describe it forever, or just
let you read it because my experience was exactly what this man described. I
have been casually drinking (not getting drunk) for several years now after
almost 10 years in AA. It's amazing I had not one person who thought this
was possible except my husband. This excellent article describes the
lock-step nature of AA and the ability of &quot;former&quot; alcoholics to drink
safely, given they have addressed the problems that lead to their need to
drink to excess. Oh, and for the AA people reading this that say, &quot;that's
impossible, you're lying to yourself!&quot;, I have no need or desire to drink
the way I did. It took a great deal of work (outside AA) and soul searching,
but the reasons I drank have been resolved.

<P>
I hope you enjoy the article, I know I did!

<P>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sarah,
<P>
Thanks for the link. Yes, isn't that a perceptive article? That was Dr. Arthur H. Cain,
who clearly recognized that A.A. was a cult that was seriously departing from reality.
And, if I'm not mistaken, Dr. Cain's Harper's article was the first article
in a nationwide magazine that
criticized Alcoholics Anonymous, and stated that A.A. was not the
wonderful panacea that they were claiming.
<P>
I just happen to have both of Dr. Cain's articles,
<a href="orange-ahcain.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<P>
&quot;BurkeD&quot; seems to have confused the source of the article. I have that
article as coming from the September 19, 1964 issue of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>.
The Harper's article is quite different. Happily, I have both.
<P>
I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better.
The big secret that A.A. does not want people to know is that lots of &quot;alcoholics&quot;
(<a href="orange-letters126.html#definitions" target="newwin40">whatever
that word is really supposed to mean</a>) recover by tapering off into moderate,
controlled drinking.
<P>
Many years ago, way back in 1980, the famous government think tank,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="newwin77">the Rand Corporation, found</a>
that the successful people who had stopped drinking self-destructively
were evenly split between total abstinence and tapering off into
moderate, controlled, drinking.
So total abstinence is not the only way.
It all depends on the individual person.
<P>
Personally, I'm one of the people who has to totally abstain from alcohol to keep it under control.
(And I have to totally abstain from tobacco to keep from getting readdicted to cigarettes.)
But that is my problem, not yours.
<P>
When that Rand Corporation report was published, the A.A. true believers had a hissy-fit.
They screamed that the Rand Corporation was killing alcoholics.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Rand_1739" target="_blank">Ann Landers indignantly printed a denunciation</a>
and said that it was irresponsible to release such information.
As if alcoholics are too stupid to handle the truth.
(Remember Jack Nicholson screaming, &quot;The truth? You can't handle the truth!&quot;)
<P>
But in my experience, alcoholics are not a separate species of stupid sub-humans.
They are as intelligent as the rest of the people, and they
need more true information, not less. 
(What a
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">vicious, insulting stereotype
of alcoholics</a>
A.A. really spreads.)

So I'm glad to hear that my web site helped you in some way.

<P>
I have been in AA for some time now and appreciate your project. One of AA's biggest
faults is discouraging its members to think for themselves. Oddly, AA has given me a
good perspective on my life and taught me that I could think for myself. I tune out
the majority of what I hear there, I see AA as an opportunity to encourage people to
embark on the path of classical philosophy &#8212; to seek the good and question the
actions of their own existence. For me, my recovery from alcoholism would be
worthless if I did not, at about one year of sobriety, do something radical and
choose to think for myself. Consequently, I do not seek the people in the AA
fellowship who are robots or zealots &#8212; I seek the independent, free-thinking
philosophers. They do exist within AA &#8212; although they are few and far between.

<P>
Anyway, I was reading

<a href="orange-letters126.html#Eugene15" target="_blank">a letter
on your site about a group called 'Jerry's Kids' within Eugene/Springfield AA</a>.

 I can verify what John S. claimed about them. It is
common knowledge for those who have been in AA around here over the past couple
years. Jerry S. holds his own meetings around here and has been personally barred
from several local meetings. He conducts these meetings and sponsors both men and
women. Those who are his followers may not be directly sponsored by him, but all the
Jerry's Kids emphasize belonging to a 'Sponsorship Tree'. They draw in newcomers and
corner them into being sponsored by people with relatively no sobriety. From what I
hear, Jerry's meetings are focused on his interpretation and encourage kneeling
prayers during the meeting. Its members encourage one another to tell their senior
members their secrets.

<P>
Jerry's Kids, from what I understand, has been dormant in the Eugene area until
about one year ago. His meetings have more followers now and they attend outside
meetings to employ their zealous recruiting practices. His now 21 year old wife
attends meetings and exhibits behavior that is surreal. On the whole, I notice that
they pick on young newcomers and preach about accepting that God will do anything
for them and that everything is okay.

Hello P,
<P>
Thank you for the letter, and I'm glad to hear that your brain is awake and functioning.
<P>
And thanks for the news about Jerry's Kids. What a tragi-comedy. And it is especially
unfortunate that they are preying on the young. There are just wanna-be cult leaders
everywhere, aren't there?
Since I'm just outside of Portland, and they are down in Eugene, that isn't very far away. 

<P>
Have a good day, and a good life. Oh, and congratulations on your year of sobriety.
Now it gets a little easier.

Subject:  	The Courts and AA<br>

<P>
In catching up with the latest at Orange Papers, I noticed the remarks about certain
AA groups being unhappy about courts sentencing offenders to the program.  Perhaps
you have covered this somewhere in your research that I have not come across but in
case not, I point out the testimony of Chuck Chamberlain (Clancy Imislund's sponsor)
before Congress.  Senator Harold Hughes led the hearing and he was an AA member (I
used to have a copy of one of his talks).  My interpretation of the testimony is
that these two kicked off the game of recovery via government intervention and
subsidization.  AA has no business complaining.

<P>
The website with the testimony is going through an upgrade so the link
may not work (but you may already know this since I picked up the site
from Orange Papers).  The particulars are Chuck C. September 27, 1969
Testimony before a U.S. Senate Subcommittee.

<P>
Your work is most appreciated!

Hi Kathy,
<P>
Thank you for the tip. I didn't know about that. I haven't read all of Silkworth.net, yet...
<P>
That is so interesting that I made a local copy,
<a href="orange-chuckc1969.html" target="_blank">here</a>, so we don't need to worry
about Silkworth.net becoming disorganized.

<P>
Yes, Chuck Chamberlain sure parrots the party line. He's got so many of
the standard slogans in there:
<P>
<font color="black" face="Helvetica,Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<ul>

<P><LI> Alcoholism is a disease.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(But Bill Wilson said that &quot;we have never called alcoholism a disease&quot;. See
the signature below.)
</font>

<P><LI> Alcoholism is an allergy of the body coupled with an obsession of the mind.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(The <i>Big Book</i> says that Dr. Silkworth said that.)
</font>

<P><LI> &quot;why am I not drunk this morning? I'm an alcoholic.&quot;<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Maybe it's because you chose to abstain from drinking alcohol today...)
</font>

<P><LI> Traditionally we neither endorse or oppose any causes. We cooperate but we do not affiliate.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Right. They just use front groups like NCADD, ASAM, and Hazelden to do the
dirty work for them.)
</font>


<P><LI> We also have the tradition that we are self supporting. We don't take any moneys from any outside sources whatsoever.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">Tell that to the
alcoholics in Mexico and Germany</a> who got sued so the American A.A.
could illegally take more money. And then there was $100,000 from the city of San Diego.)
</font>
<P><LI>
When you sentence us, don't give us that lecture, because we can't take it.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(That is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">
the standard A.A. stereotype of &quot;the alcoholic&quot;</a>,
a dishonest, neurotic sub-human.)
</font>

<P><LI>
So, indeed, in A.A. we have a lot of fun.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Oh yes, it's just so much fun to be in a cult.)
</font>

<P><LI>
I went to the clergy, to men of medicine and to a few people who knew
more psychiatry than there is. And my answer from all of them was
willpower, backbone and stand-up-and-be-a man.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Yes, all of those educated men were too stupid to recommend cult religion.)
</font>

<P><LI>
I never heard of the disease of alcoholism until I came to my first
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(As if Dr. Benjamin Rush didn't declare alcoholism a disease in 1784.)
</font>

<P><LI>
It's a holdover from the days when the only descriptive adjectives used
for people like me were bums, spineless people, dregs of society, a
cancer on the social body, and all that sort of thing.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(So
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">now A.A. declares</a>
that alcoholics are atheists, dishonest, <i>in denial</i>, selfish,
&quot;constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves&quot;,
disgusting, indulging in the Seven Deadly Sins,
&quot;born that way&quot;, and they <i>don't want to get too
 good too soon</i>. A.A. has really improved things, hasn't it?
<P>
By the way, if alcoholics are really that bad, why on Earth would anyone ask an A.A.
member for advice on how to live a good life?)
</font>


<P><LI>
Senators will ask: &quot;What good does it do? ...&quot;<br>
I don't have any facts and figures. I know we're going to develop some
 as we go along in these hearings, ...<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Well, they still don't have any honest numbers that tell what good A.A. does.
We have been waiting 70 years now, and
<a href="orange-letters147.html#AA_success_rate" target="_blank">A.A. still does not have
an official statement of their success rate</a>.)
</font>

<P><LI>
Now this thing is seemingly proven in our work. Any alcoholic who sits
through an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, leaves knowing the answer is
there &#8212; whether or not he admits that he has a problem.<br>
...<br>
So I believe that no one, no alcoholic, regardless of whether he has
admitted it or not, who is exposed to this therapy about which we are
talking, leaves with any questions in his mind. I think he knows
immediately that the answer is in the room.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Nothing like self-congratulatory bull. And he calls A.A. &quot;therapy&quot;.
But when I criticize &quot;A.A. therapy&quot; for not working, the A.A.
true believers declare that A.A. is not a therapy program, and
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Ruth_Fox_9" target="_blank">A.A. is not a treatment program</a>,
so they don't keep count of treatment successes. )
</font>


<P><LI>
They [the alcoholics] are going to be sent to these detoxification centers.
 But they're going to be sent there by the court or by the police instead
 of being sent to jail. They will have to go through that.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(That sure helps with the cult recruiting problem, doesn't it?)
</font>


<P><LI>
<b>Senator Dominick:</b> That program has worked; that's what I want to know?<br>
<b>Mr. Chuck C.:</b> Yes.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times,Times Roman,SanSerif">
(Huh??!! What worked? They just said that they don't have any numbers. They don't even know
what the A.A. success rate is. And yet they still declare success.)
</font>

</ul>
</font>

<P>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. I'm going to. It's summer, and the sun is shining,
and it's beautiful out there.
