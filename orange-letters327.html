<p>

Yeah. At least the birds do fight back occasionally. When I lived on the
farm, there was this one mockingbird who really had it out for Alley,
probably because she killed another mockingbird. It would dive down at her
and force her to hide under the lawn furniture. Hilarious. I would rescue
Alley, not because she deserved to be rescued, but because that bird made a
lot of racket while attacking Alley. It even went after Titania, probably
because she's a cat, and she looks a lot like Alley. Both cats are tabbies,
with the main difference being that they have different stripe patterns.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Yes, the last time I saw a bird attacking a cat, it was because the cat had grabbed the
mate of the bird.
</font>
<p>

Yeah, ocicats are basically a combination of siamese, abyssinians, and
American shorthairs. Somehow, that results in a cat with a spotted tabby
pattern that looks like an ocelot, despite having no wild cat DNA (unlike
the similar-looking savannahs, who are serval/cat hybrids).

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I think my two favorite pieces of cat-related bullshit are this Kickstarter
for a cat motivational tape<br>
&lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005420/http://www.regretsy.com/2012/08/17/i-can-haz-self-ezteems/" target="_blank">http://www.regretsy.com/2012/08/17/i-can-haz-self-ezteems/</a>&gt;<br>
(mostly for the hilarious Rob Paulsen reading) and this reiki cat video<br>

&lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005420/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPQ9DiyKde4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPQ9DiyKde4</a>&gt;.
<br>
In the latter, the cat apparently wasn't even ill, just hyper. You know,
like most cats tend to be for 30 minutes &#8212; 1 hour each day. Since the cat
calmed down with the reiki, it probably just wanted affection, and putting
your hand on a cat's head and speaking to it in a soothing voice is
affection. Titania gets in the way and walks all over my laptop when she
wants attention. Sometimes, she steps on the power button.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

And there is a cruel irony to the Dakotas being anti-Indian, considering
those states were named after Indians.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, and the Dakotas were originally &quot;the Indian Territory&quot;, guaranteed
to the Indians by treaty forever  &#8212;  &quot;as long as the river flows, and the grass grows&quot;, etc.
But then somebody discovered gold in the Black Hills.
<p>
Funny how gold automatically invalidates previous promises.

</font>
<p>

I do have to wonder about the sort of people who have so much anger and
hatred as a lot of talk radio personalities do. It can't possibly be good
for them. I can see why Rush Limbaugh abuses painkillers. Spewing vitriol
every day drains a person, no matter how much money they make from doing
that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. What kind of a life is it, knowing that you are making millions of dollars as a professional liar and
hate-monger?
You would have to have a very warped value system to rationalize that.
</font>
<p>

Unfortunately, Big Nurse is everywhere when you have a disability or mental
illness. Or, heaven forbid, both. Incidentally, mental hospitals and
prisons are a lot alike. No shoes with laces allowed. You can't wear
certain clothes (I had my overalls confiscated). The days are highly
regimented, from the time they want you to wake up to the time they want
you to go to bed. Visitors are only allowed at certain hours. After every
meal, they check to make sure you've returned all your plastic cutlery. By
the way, the food tastes like prison food. The soap is in travel-sized
containers. And you stay in the hospital for however long the doctors want
you to stay.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That last sentence sounds frightening. In bad rehabs, that translates into
&quot;as long as your health insurance pays.&quot;

</font>
<p>

Warm Springs is kind of a cross between that environment and a college.
There's no restrictions on your clothing. You're actually free to walk to
town and even have a car, unlike the mental hospital, where I was confined
inside from day one until the day I got out. Things are set up so you don't
need a car, though, and there's even trips to Walmart every weekend. The
cafeteria food tastes significantly better. Your parents can visit you
whenever they want. But if you stay with your parents for longer than the
weekend, you have to tell your assigned counselor beforehand. Kind of like
a probation officer, actually.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

The whole &quot;working your way up&quot; thing isn't restricted to the medications.
New residents start off in a barebones dorm with a roommate, and you're not
allowed to bring in furniture that can't be moved easily. To be fair,
that's because there's a decent chance your roommate will be a wheelchair
user. Eventually, you can move in to an apartment with a fridge and your
own room. They never trust you with appliances like toasters, though. This
set-up is a lot like my old college, where upperclassmen got nicer dorms
than the freshmen.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I can't quite tell from the tour just how regimented the day is. Is it
structured like a college, or structured like a mental hospital? I'm also
not sure how easy it is to quit the program if I don't like it. But the
place does have a fair amount of good points. They stopped requiring
everybody to take the same living skills classes before work training.
Instead, they test everyone to see what skills they need. There's a variety
of work I can choose to do. It seems like I'll get paid while training.
They'll help me get a job when I'm done with the program.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

So, it seems like I can get a lot out of this if I can put up with being
treated like a naughty teenager for a while. I do wish a non-patronizing
program of this type wasn't too much to ask for, though.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Good luck there. Yes, I also wish for non-patronizing personel in such places. It seems to be an occupational
hazard  &#8212;  many of those jobs like caretaker for people with mental problems quickly lead to
the staff having patronizing attitudes, or worse.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Dear Orange,
<p>
A few years ago I got sucked into the AA nightmare. At the time I thought it was the
only way out of an ongoing battle I'd been having with alcohol. Well, it turned out
that it only made it worse. I was always relapsing, going back to meetings,
relapsing, going back and on and on. Finally, just one year ago I ended up in the
hospital for the umpteenth time, nearly dead and so messed up that they kept me
sedated for a week while trying to get my heart rhythms back to normal. While in the
hospital, a friend stayed with me and together we searched the internet for
alternative answers to AA and found your site. There was enough information there to
get me going in an entirely new direction, 180 degrees away from AA, a direction
that I think saved my life. Today, I'm sober, I'm happy, I'm healthy and I've been
that way ever since leaving the hospital one year ago. I have a future ahead of me,
a new business I now own and I'm in better shape physically than I
was when I was 20. Most importantly, I have drive, determination and I now know I
WILL make it and realize my goals. It's all because I read the information you
provided and made a decision.....a decision to take responsibility for my actions
and I consciously decided NOT to drink, ever again. I made that promise to myself
and it's worked. I have no cravings, I'm not an unhappy &quot;dry drunk&quot; and I'll never
set foot inside an AA meeting again. I now see AA for what it really is, a cult
that simply does not work. I also occasionally see some of the AA members that I
used to see in meetings, on the street from time to time, and to a man, they're all
still locked in a battle they'll never win as long as they stay in AA. I've tried
to help a couple of them but there is no help until they open their minds and see
that they're being brainwashed. I just wanted to thank you for putting your web
site out there. There are alternatives and they work, whereas AA will
always fail. Thanks Orange, I have my life back.
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
LDJ

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello LDJ,
<p>
Wow. Thank you for the letter. I'm flattered and very happy to hear that things worked out for you
okay. It sounds like you've got it, and there isn't really anything for me to say other than,
&quot;Thanks for the thanks, and have a good day.&quot; And congratulations.

<h2>Mother testifies about finding Ginger Hayden's body</h2>
Posted Thursday, Sep. 20, 2012
<h3>By Dianna Hunt</h3>

    

<p>

    Her last words to her mother were, &quot;I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>During 
emotional testimony that left some jurors in tears, the mother of a 
slain 18-year-old woman testified from her wheelchair Thursday about 
finding her daughter's brutally stabbed body in the apartment they 
shared in west Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Sharon Hayden Harvey, who has multiple 
sclerosis but was not using a wheelchair at the time her daughter was 
killed, told jurors in state District Judge Everett Young's court that 
she found the body when she went to investigate why her daughter had not
 turned off her alarm.</p>

<p>That morning, Sept. 5, 1984, would have 
been Ginger Hayden's second day of classes at the University of Texas at
 Arlington. Harvey said she saw Hayden slumped beside the bed.</p>


<p>&quot;I thought she was teasing me,&quot; Hayden testified. &quot;I went down and touched her
leg and it was cold.</p>

<p>She said she stumbled from the room and called an
operator for help.</p>

<p>&quot;I said, 'My baby's dead,'&quot; she said.</p>


<p>Her screams woke the neighbors.</p>

<p>Harvey fought through tears several
times on the witness stand but broke down in sobs as she left the courtroom.</p>

<p>She
 was among the last witnesses to testify for the prosecution in the 
capital murder trial of Ryland Shane Absalon, 45, a former schoolmate of
 Hayden's at Arlington Heights High School who lived in the apartment 
upstairs.</p>

<p>Prosecutors Lisa Callaghan, Jim Hudson and Anna 
Summersett have presented DNA evidence linking Absalon to the crime, and
 several witnesses have testified about confessions he made while 
undergoing drug and alcohol abuse treatment a few years after the 
killing.</p>

<p>Defense attorney Gary Udashen has told jurors that 
Absalon falsely confessed because of pressure to participate during the 
Straight Inc. program, a controversial drug rehabilitation program that 
was eventually shut down because of abuse allegations.</p>


<p>Two former participants testified Thursday about hearing Absalon confess to
stabbing a girl while in group therapy in 1986.</p>

<p>Stefany
 Knight, now a social worker in Arkansas, said Absalon told the group 
that he was high on heroin when he stabbed a young woman to death.</p>

<p>&quot;Shane
 stood up to admit to wrongdoing when he was high on heroin,&quot; Knight 
testified. &quot;He said he killed a girl ... stabbed her. He had a knife. He
 waited in the closet, then he stabbed her on the bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Details of
 the confession closely mirror the facts in the slaying. Hayden was 
found slumped beside her blood-soaked bed and had been stabbed 57 times.</p>

<p>Another
 former participant, Michele Valencia, who now owns a physical therapy 
clinic in Plano, said the confession made her &quot;ill, sick to my stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>But
 she later testified under questioning from the defense that the goal of
 the untrained program staff was to force people to admit to wrongdoing 
even if it wasn't true. She said she told the group she was a 
drug-addict and alcoholic even though she wasn't, just to get out of the
 program.</p>

<p>&quot;It was cult-like,&quot; she said. &quot;There was some brainwashing going
on ... I learned I had to conform. I had to do it to get out.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier
 in the day, Deputy Medical Examiner Marc Krouse told jurors that 
Hayden's injuries indicate she fought back against her knife-wielding 
assailant, but that the onslaught of stab wounds eventually killed her.</p>

<p>Krouse
 said that four stab wounds were &quot;very bad&quot; and several potentially 
lethal, but the 53 other stabs and cuts contributed to the massive blood
 loss that eventually killed her.</p>

<p>The defense is expected to begin
 presenting its case this morning. If convicted of capital murder, 
Absalon would face automatic life in prison but would be eligible for 
parole after 20 years. Because he was under 18 at the time of the 
killing, he is not eligible for the death penalty.</p>

Hello Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. That is Straight, which was actually worse than A.A., if you can imagine such a thing.
Straight was a very abusive &quot;treatment program&quot; that was derived from Synanon,
which was derived from Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Dederich, the founder of Synanon, 
was a former member of Alcoholics Anonymous who decided that he could take the &quot;best&quot;
parts of A.A. and add on a confrontational &quot;group therapy&quot; where everybody attacked everybody else,
and make a better treatment program for drug addicts.
Dederich had this crazy idea that having people verbally attack each other and rip each other to shreds would
improve people and make them get clean and sober.
<p>
It didn't work. In the end, Synanon degenerated into a nightmare commune cult of guns and alcohol and violence
and attempted assassinations. Synanon formed a goon squad called the &quot;Imperial Marines&quot; that was armed to the
teeth.
The  &quot;Imperial Marines&quot;  attacked former members and dropouts. They
smashed Phil Ritter's head with a baseball bat from behind
in the dark of night, and he got meningitis and nearly died.
When some victims of such abuse sued Synanon, the &quot;Imperial Marines&quot;
put a rattlesnake, minus the warning rattle, in the lawyer Paul Morantz's mailbox.
He nearly died from the snake bite.
When the police came to arrest the leader Chuck Dederich for attempted murder, he was too drunk to walk.
The police had to carry Dederich out on a stretcher.  That's really quite some Director of a rehab program,
isn't it?

<p>
Nevertheless, Synanon is still the basis for all of the &quot;confrontational&quot; drug and alcohol treatment programs
in the USA. Former members of Synanon claim to be experts on recovery, and they have set up new abusive programs using
Synanon techniques. And those programs spawned more bad programs. There are literally dozens of abusive
treatment programs that decended from Synanon, which descended from Alcoholics Anonymous nonsense.
Quackery everywhere. What Synanon really taught them is that you need no credentials or training or expertise
to go into the child-abuse-for-pay business.
Just advertise that you are &quot;helping children&quot;, and you can get away with murder.
(<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">Literally</a>.)

<p>
Every Straight program that ever existed was charged with child abuse and sued. They all shut down under a
firestorm of lawsuits and accusations and charges of criminal child abuse. Nevertheless, more abusive descendants of
Straight are still in operation, &quot;helping children&quot;.

Now legally, this story presents some interesting questions. The defense lawyer has a point when he
complains that his client was coerced into the confession by Straight.
Not much of a point, but a little one. I'm sure that
the prosecutor will get her conviction anyway. But legally, it's a real question whether someone who is
undergoing court-ordered attendance (which this apparently was not)
at any confessional drug or alcohol &quot;treatment program&quot; (like A.A. or N.A. or anything based on
12-Step cult religion) can then be
prosecuted with the confessions heard there. I think not. However, the prosecutor has DNA evidence, which is
probably not tainted by the confession.
<p>
Legally, a program like Straight has no right to confidentiality of confessions, like the Catholic Church gets.
Straight was never a religion, or based on confessing sins and seeking God, like A.A. is.
A.A. supposedly has such protection, because
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">judges have ruled that A.A. is a religion</a>,
but that is also violated often.
A medical treatment program, which A.A., N.A., and Straights also purport to be, is also supposed to
have medical confidentiality, but obviously, they don't.

Nothing that you say in any A.A. or N.A. meeting, or &quot;group encounter&quot;
drug and alcohol treatment program is confidential or safe, really.

On that point, I advise people to assume that anything confessed in an A.A. or
N.A. meeting, or in a rehab &quot;group therapy&quot; session, will be faxed to
the police, published on the Internet, and gossiped all over town.

<p>
From a medical point of view, I'm very curious about how heroin supposedly made this guy kill a girl.
Heroin does not tend to make people violent &#8212; it makes them passive, and &quot;down&quot;.
A junkie who just got his fix is nodding out and very happy, not looking for someone to kill.
I suspect that this murderer is a very dangerous, very sick psycho killer who just
happened to take some heroin before committing murder.
Perhaps he was trying to calm down his spinning mind by taking heroin.
Apparently, it didn't work. Obviously, the guy has much bigger issues than a heroin habit.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Ron,
<p>
Congratulations for your 29 years of choosing to not drink alcohol.
Apparently, that's the smart choice for you. By the way, there is no &quot;sour grapes&quot; for me.
I have 11, almost 12, years of sobriety too, so my &quot;program&quot; is also working great.
<p>
Thank you for showing once again that Alcoholics Anonymous really is a cult.
Surrender to &quot;the program&quot; or &quot;the group&quot; is a standard cult
characteristic. It's in The Cult Test. Look here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult" target="_blank">Cult Test Question 19: Surrender To The Group.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">Cult Test Answer for A.A. 19: Surrender To The Group.</a>
</ul>

<p>
Surrender to a cult is never the answer to drug or alcohol problems. The very idea is insane. But that's what
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was &#8212; insane</a>.
He just took
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's pro-Nazi cult religion</a>
and declared that it was the cure for alcoholism, so alcoholics had to
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender" target="_blank">make a surrender</a>&quot;,
and that was supposedly &quot;the answer&quot;.

<p>
A.A. has no magic &quot;secret&quot;. Again, that is cult talk  &#8212; 
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea" target="_blank">We Have The Panacea</a>.

<p>
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#self_reliance" target="_blank">There is nothing wrong with self-will</a>.
It beats the heck out of being a slave and just obeying someone else's will.
And doing just what you are told is the path that leads to drinking the cyanide
koolaid when the leader tells you to.
(Or to not taking your medications, or to becoming a victim...)
<p>
By the way, what you are calling &quot;self-will&quot; is often really just <i>thinking for yourself</i>, rather than
being one of the sheep.

<p>
The first sentence on page 58 is Bill Wilson 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">lying with qualifiers</a>,
again: &quot;thoroughly followed our path.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, William G. Wilson,
Chapter Five, &quot;How It Works&quot;, page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill wanted to count only the sober people, so that his &quot;program&quot; would
look like it really works, so he claimed that only the sober people had &quot;thoroughly
followed his path.&quot; Bill Wilson was a lying con artist who knew how to play word games.

Only count the sober people, and disqualify all of those who drink again for not
having thoroughly followed the path, and hey presto! &#8212; you suddenly have a
100% success rate. What a great program. <i>NOT!</i>
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Wade,
<p>
A.A. has not &quot;<a href="orange-letters317.html#millions" target="_blank">helped so many</a>.&quot;
A.A. harms and even kills more people than it saves. That is why I criticize it.

I'd be all for A.A. if it actually worked half as well as the A.A. promoters claim.
But telling people to list and confess their sins and not take their medications
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">kills more people than it saves</a>.
<p>
And practicing
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>

Hi Orange

<p>
Two more tragic suicides.

<p>
Jessica below recently killed herself. I knew her personally from meeting her at AA
meets.
I liked her and some considerable years ago she seemed friendly and approachable but
later
became very wary of me. Although I have to honestly say I do not know why.

<h3>Inquest hears of Brighton teacher's repeated suicide attempts</h3>
<p>
3:30pm Wednesday 15th August 2012 in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005420/http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/" target="_blank">News</a>
</p>
      
A Brighton teacher &nbsp;tried to hang herself three times in a day at
a psychiatric hospital which had been criticised for patient safety 
three months earlier.
</p>
<p>
Jessica Philpott died three days after throttling herself with a 
television aerial cable in the gardens of Mill View Hospital in Hove.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday the jury at her inquest was told the hospital had decided to
discharge her despite &quot;grave concerns&quot; about the risk she posed to 
herself.
</p>
<p>
Miss Philpott, a former RE teacher at Oakmeeds Community College in 
Burgess Hill, suffered from emotionally unstable personality disorder, 
also called borderline personality disorder.
</p>
      
<p>
Between September last year and her death in February she went to 
hospital six times, after cutting herself, taking overdoses of 
prescription drugs or strangling herself.
</p>
<p>
On February 13 she was found in the hospital gardens with the cable 
around her neck. Earlier staff had stopped two attempts she made to 
barricade herself in rooms and strangle herself.
</p>
<p>
The inquest is being held to determine how Miss Philpott died and 
whether Mill View &quot;by its act or omission&quot; caused or contributed to her 
death.
</p>
<p>
Miss Philpott had been admitted to Mill View on February 1 after strangling herself at

<p>
A man in a nearby town of Worthing killed himself in March by jumping off a
crane. Verbal reports from acquaintances say he was seen at Al Anon meets looking
for somewhere to fit in. The last place I saw him was at an AA meet last year where
he complained that my eating chips at the meet stopped him understanding what was
going on.

<p>
Obviously my own self protection is a strong motivation not to approach aggressive
people so I avoided him.

<p>
I heard this morn from a friend that some one I should know who claimed to want to
go back to AA died. He had met a girl in AA and they had got married and had a
daughter. I can not put a name to these people although their names seem familiar.
But with 500 people a year in our area being sent by the treatment centres I just
get lost in a sea of faces.

<p>
I can not help but feel that the 12 Step Program probally fucked with these peoples
heads and left them no option but to kill themselves.

<p>
I can not help but think of
<a href="orange-letters311.html#William_B" target="_blank">my earlier letter</a>:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot; did my own survey. I went to 5 meetings AA, NA, CA, on Monday last week. I counted
157 people not including duplications. Using Vaillant's figures: In one year's time
3 or 4 of these people will be dead. The quote of Vaillant on your site does not
reveal a distribution chart for the deaths. It just says that 29 out of the 100
people he could trace were dead after 8 years. We have to remember that the 6 people
he could not trace may be dead as well.<br>
129 x 29% = 37<br>
Am I missing something because I find it hard to believe that these people who I
know and love are going to die.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
In reviewing this letter I can see that my maths is correct but how I got from a
sample of 157 to 129 not sure &#8212; must have had a bad day.

<p>
However the facts that I have reported at the beginning of the letter from only
those people who I know or should know personally bear out Vaillants findings.
Since Vaillant clearly reported his findings factually this does not suprise me.

<p>
On a personal note one day when my son D and I were playing golf on his Wii machine
I said &quot;lets look in the shed for some clubs and go out to the local 9 hole. I
forgot that it is half a golf course not a pitch and putt. So off we went. I also
forgot that I would have to carry the clubs.
<p>
Anyway D enjoyed it so now every weekend we play golf. D particularly likes rolling
around in the bunkers and playing the 7th hole on his hands and knees using only a
putter.

<p>
My father in law offered to buy some junior clubs but I had that covered I thought
it was because he is from Scotland and he wants D to remember his Scottish heritage.
But apparently he told my wife that &quot;no one encouraged me to do anything when I
was young&quot; and indeed Hell would have frozen over before my father took me to play
golf. Is it not amazing that childhood regrets/losses/etc. echo down the generations.

<p>
One query I remember seeing a film which was claimed to be based on a true story of
a young lady who led a family of hand raised geese on a migration to Florida by
using a microlight. So the question is how do your orphan geese achieve this feat.

<p>
Regards and Respect<br>
William

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi William,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the information. The suicides are certainly depressing.
So I'll take the last item first. That's easy.
<p>
The story of the family of hand-raised geese getting led south by an ultra-light is a true story.
Actually, the journey's start was in Canada, in Ontario, I think, and the destination was North Carolina
in the USA. They made a movie of it  &#8212;  it's called &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;. (Recommended. Rent it,
or download it, or something.) I described that movie more in this letter:<br>
<a href="orange-letters147.html#geese" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters147.html#geese</a>.

<p>
How you get the geese to follow is super-easy: You can't stop them. Canada Geese goslings are very intelligent,
and they know who their parents are. And they know when you have adopted them and saved their lives, and
become their foster parent.
So they become very attached to you, and follow you around all day long and hop into bed with you at night,
and cry if you won't let them sleep with you. (I learned that one the hard way, and had to give it up and
sleep with them.) 

<p>
Young Canada Geese expect their parents to lead them south on a migration in the autumn. So when the girl
who was the foster mother of the orphaned goslings started leading them around in an ultra-light, the young
geese were eager to follow.
All that she had to do was exercise them, taking them on longer and longer
flights around the neighborhood, to build up their wing muscles before the journey.
<p>
Now, on to the suicides. That is so sad. The hospital kicking that woman out when they knew that she was
likely to commit suicide is reprehensible. I can just see some official rationalizing, &quot;It's policy. That's
what the rules say. Three days and out.&quot; I'm sure that part of that is due to budget cut-backs. Great Britain
under Margaret Thacher and the USA under Ronald Reagan have both seen big cuts to government services, and
cuts in funding of mental hospitals have been the result. Reagan actually argued that mentally-ill people
should be free  &#8212;  he was nuts, he was an Altzheimers case himself  &#8212;  so he kicked
all of the mentally-ill people out onto the streets and closed the mental hospitals.
As a result, we now have homeless mentally-ill people in the streets of every city in the USA.
And occasionally, they commit suicide or murder.
<p>
And of course, those sick people often try to fix themselves by self-medicating, so they also get into
trouble with drugs and alcohol.
<p>
I agree that A.A. and Al-Anon are doing a great disservice to those sick people. The last thing that
depressed suicidal people need is some 12-Step fanatic telling people to &quot;Work The Steps&quot; and
list and confess their many sins, wrongs, moral shortcomings, and defects of character.
That's just another &quot;repent and be saved&quot; cult religion, which is not good for already-depressed
suicidal people.
Again, A.A. is just not qualified to treat mental illness. They aren't &quot;the experts of addiction&quot;,
like they claim.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. Speaking of which, playing golf with your son is a lot more fun than
going to an A.A. meeting, isn't it? Healthier, too.

Four Goslings Underwater
</center>
Those four goslings suddenly decided to play, and also get a bath at the same time. They all just dove
and went underwater. Geese and goslings are also good underwater swimmers.
Going underwater is also a good defense against eagles and hawks that might want gosling for dinner,
so it's a good skill for them to practice.

Dr. Griffith Edwards, a psychiatrist who helped establish addiction medicine as a
science, formulating definitions of drug and alcohol dependence that are used
worldwide to diagnose and treat substance abuse, died on Sept. 13 in a hospice near
his home in Greenwich, England. He was 83.

<p>
He died after a stroke, his wife, Susan, said. The death had not been widely
reported outside England.

<p>
Dr. Edwards reshaped thinking about heavy drinkers and their problems, about the
psychology of drug use and its treatment, and about the policy implications for
governments and health agencies seeking to reduce abuse.

<p>
He was among the first doctors to perform careful studies of skid row drinkers and
of talk therapies for addictive drinking   &#8212;  &quot; these at a time, in
the 1960s, when habitual drunkenness was considered a moral failing and virtually
the only treatment was to dry out.

<p>
In 1975, Dr. Edwards took what had been a respected but obscure medical journal,
The British Journal of Addiction, and turned it into the field's flagship platform,
publishing the top research findings from around the world.

<p>
In 1976, working with Dr. Milton M. Gross, another addiction researcher, he examined
what was then loosely known as alcoholism. The two determined that a true drinking
problem had several discrete, measurable components, like craving, heightened
tolerance, loss of control and physical withdrawal symptoms. That description became
the basis for the definition of drug or alcohol dependence in two of the world's
most influential diagnostic manuals, from the American Psychiatric Association and
the World Health Organization.

<p>
&quot;He was one of the few true giants who moved the alcohol and drug field into
mainstream medicine,&quot; said Dr. Marc A. Schuckit, a distinguished professor
of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, &quot;one of the first
to begin asking questions in a systematic way about these problems&quot; rather
than merely describing them.

<p>
In one of his most influential papers, Dr. Edwards described how he and a team of
researchers, in 1977, compared the effects of a standard long-term counseling
program for heavy drinkers with a single &quot;advice&quot; session. After a year,
there were no significant differences between the groups. But after two years,
those with more severe dependence were drinking less, on average, if they had
received the more intensive therapy. The finding inspired study of the so-called
matching hypothesis, in which treatment approaches are tailored to individuals
depending on their habits.

<p>
&quot;Now it's pretty standard that no matter what therapy you use, the most
important thing is engaging patients in a collaboration to achieve sobriety,&quot;
said Thomas F. Babor, a professor in the department of community medicine and
health care at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine.

<p>
Dr. Babor, a top editor for Dr. Edwards's journal, now called Addiction, added,
&quot;He was the father of some of the major conceptual advances in this field.&quot;

<p>
James Griffith Edwards, who was known as Griff, was born on Oct. 3, 1928, in what
is now the Uttar Pradesh state of India, where his father worked as a veterinary
bacteriologist. The family moved back to England in 1929, and he received his
early education from his mother.

<p>
He won a scholarship to Oxford and, after serving in the military, graduated from
Balliol College in 1951 with a degree in animal physiology. He later added a
master's degree and a medical degree and began his career as a lecturer in 1966 at
London's Institute of Psychiatry at Maudsley Hospital. (The institute is now part
of King's College London.) There he fell under the influence of the prominent
addiction researcher David Lewis Davies.

<p>
By the time Dr. Edwards became a professor of addiction behavior at the institute,
in 1979, he was a star in the emerging field of addiction medicine, having directed
the institute's addiction research unit. In 1991, he helped establish England's
National Addiction Center.

<p>
To the end of his long career, Dr. Edwards was part scientist and part missionary,
writing hundreds of professional papers and contributing to more than 30 books.
In recent years, he wrote two books for lay readers: &quot;Alcohol the Ambiguous
Molecule&quot; (2000) and &quot;Matters of Substance&quot; (2004). He consulted
regularly with governments and with the World Health Organization on policy making.

<p>
In addition to his wife, Dr. Edwards is survived by a son, Daniel, and a daughter,
Rose, both from a previous marriage, and a granddaughter.

<p>
For all his work to reduce abuse, Dr. Edwards maintained a strong skepticism of
prohibitive measures. He and his wife hosted salonlike events at their house in
Greenwich that were known for more than the warm conversation.

<p>
&quot;He was a real wine connoisseur, and there was always a cocktail before
dinner,&quot; Dr. Babor said. &quot;He was a strong believer in social drinking.&quot;

Hello Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. Oh yes, do I have some comments and opinions on Griffith Edwards. He was a lying fraud
who devoted his career to promoting the 12-Step cult religion and passing it off as a successful cure,
and writing propaganda that declared that A.A. works. The New York Times obituary was a real white-wash
and glorification of a fraud.

<p>
I have discussed Griffith Edwards several times before.  Look here:

<ol>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Orford</a><br>
Doctors Orford and Edwards performed a big, expensive, year-long test of A.A. in England, and
found that a whole year of a 12-Step-based treatment program was no more effective than having a
doctor talk to the alcoholics for just one hour, telling them to quit drinking.
<p>
The NY Times obituary mentions this clinical test, but neglects to mention the fact
that Griffith Edwards then proceeded to ignore these test results and spend the
rest of his life promoting the 12-Step quack treatment anyway.

Griffith Edwards' propaganda:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Edwards conjectures, on the basis of available research, that &quot;AA
probably works, in some way or other, for not less than 50% of the
troubled drinkers that make contact with it.&quot;</font>

Hi again, Peter,
<p>
Yes, a very interesting article.
<p>
The first thing that caught my attention was the 60-year-old woman junkie. I thought, &quot;If she hasn't
quit by now, then she never will. Might as well just legally give her the stuff.&quot;
It would save society money in the long run.

<p>
Harm reduction saves money, too. Not to mention the fact that it is the compassionate and Christian thing to do.
<p>
I agree with your statement:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The politicians and other critics who oppose harm reduction are on the wrong
side of history, and they will be judged harshly.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately, I think that there will large stacks of bodies before public sentiment
recognizes that the prohibition crusaders are barbaric, sort of like how we now
look at the &quot;noble, virtuous, Godly&quot; witch-hunters of the Middle Ages.
Alas, our current enlightened attitude towards witches doesn't bring the burned girls back to life.

Yes that's true. Im just hyped because we're gonna win. But sure, it would be nice
if we didn't have to struggle against ignorance and malice. Yeah ... dead witches
