In the spring of 1935, after a few months of sobriety, Bill Wilson made one more attempt
to get and keep a straight job. He got involved with some more Wall Street
manipulators who were in a proxy battle to take over a rubber equipment company
in Akron, Ohio. Bill went there as part of a team that was attempting to take
over the company.
They were out-maneuvered by the opposite team and lost the proxy battle.
Bill's fellow team members packed up and left town, leaving Bill alone to
try to salvage something from the situation. Bill Wilson found himself alone
in Akron with a week-end to kill.

<p>
<a name="ftnt134_ret"> </a>
The standard Alcoholics Anonymous story is that Bill was wandering around the
Mayflower Hotel in downtown Akron, feeling depressed and thinking about drinking.
He stood in a lobby where there was a hotel bar at one end of the lobby,
with music coming out through the saloon doors, and at the other end of the lobby
was a public telephone, with a plaque on the wall that listed many of the local
churches and their ministers.
Bill was torn between going into the bar and having a drink, or calling
a church for help, for someone to talk
to.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt134" target="_blank">134</a></sup></font>

<font color="blue">
(The biographer Mathew J. Raphael wrote that Bill's story was physically impossible.
<a href="orange-letters58.html#Mayflower" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
</font>
-------->

<p>
Bill wrote that, as he was considering drinking, he thought:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;But what about his responsibilities &#8212; his family and
the men who would die because they would not know how to get well,
ah &#8212; yes, those other alcoholics?&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
chapter 11, <i>&quot;A Vision For You&quot;</i>, page 154.<br>
That text is present in all editions of the book, from the 1939 multilith of the manuscript
to the fourth edition.</font>
<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
Responsibilities? What responsibilities? What grandiose nonsense.<br>
Mind you, Bill Wilson had not sobered up a single alcoholic at that point, 
other than himself. In fact, Bill had only five months of sobriety,
and yet he imagined that he was so important that
other alcoholics would die if Bill relapsed and didn't tell them how to quit drinking.
That's Delusions of Grandeur.
<p>
And Bill's only family was his wife Lois, who was working in Loeser's department store
to support Bill. She wasn't depending on Bill, which was a good thing, because he wasn't
going to come back home for many months.

So, the official A.A. story goes, Bill went to the telephone and
picked out a minister supposedly at random &#8212;
Reverend Walter F. Tunks &#8212; and called him.
Rev. Tunks allegedly gave Bill a list of 10 names to call,
and Bill tried them all, he said, without finding a fellow alcoholic to talk to.
Bill said that the last person Bill called was a Norman Sheppard
who in turn sent him to Henrietta Seiberling, who was a friend of a
drunken doctor in town &#8212; Doctor Robert
Smith.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt134" target="_blank">134</a></sup></font>
<p>
Henrietta Seiberling and Dr. Robert Smith just happened to also be members
of the Oxford Group, and she welcomed him and told him &quot;You come right out here.&quot;
Henrietta arranged an appointment for Bill to see her alcoholic friend
Dr. Robert Smith the next day,
because Dr. Bob was already passing-out drunk that day.
<p>
Bill declared that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;In retrospect, it all seems as though it had been divinely
ordained.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt135" target="_blank">135</a></sup></font>

There are a couple of big problems with Bill Wilson's story:
<ol>
<li> The public telephone was on the ground floor of the hotel,
but the hotel bar was upstairs, on a raised level.
They were not at opposite ends of the lobby, so it was impossible for Bill to
have stood in the middle of the lobby and looked back and forth between one and the other,
debating whether to choose the devil or the
angel.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt133" target="_blank">133</a></sup></font>
<p>
The biography of Bill Wilson that was written by Matthew J. Raphael explains:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;None of the several narratives of Bill W.'s moment of truth
conforms to the actual configuration of the lobby in 1935.
They all misleadingly depict Bill crossing between the
elevator bank and the bar at opposite ends. Given the deployment
of furniture in 1935 (according to an old photograph), so
as to leave an aisle to the desk from the Main Street stairs,
the only possible path for Bill to have paced ran north and
south across the width of the lobby, with the elevators at one
end. But what stood at the other end, past the desk in the
middle, was the State Street entrance. There was no bar on
the same lobby level as the elevators. It lay neither &quot;down
the lobby&quot; (AA) nor &quot;at one end of my beat&quot; (AACA) nor
&quot;at one end of the lobby&quot; (PIO) nor &quot;directly across from
his path of march&quot; (BW). To enter the Merryman Tavern,
Bill would have had to climb seven steps to the mezzanine
level, and he could not have seen inside without such an ascent.
(This may account for the otherwise inexplicable emphasis in
the accounts on bar sounds rather than alluring smells or
sights.) Once Wilson had picked up the phone, moreover, a pillar
would have blocked his view of the mezzanine. The phone bank,
tucked around the corner of the lobby extention, would have
provided him sanctuary from ocular temptation.&quot;<br>

<li>
Bill Wilson did not just choose to call Rev. Walter Tunks at random, or by lucky chance.
That wasn't a coincidence or 'Divine Providence'.
Rev. Walter Tunks was one of the staunchest Oxford Group members in Akron,
and Oxford Group members in New York had almost certainly told Bill to remember to call
Rev. Tunks (and go to Oxford Group meetings) while he was in Akron.
In fact, Rev. Tunks had been &quot;changed&quot; by Rev. Sam Shoemaker, who was also
Bill's mentor.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt141" target="_blank">141</a></sup></font>
<p>
Even the official A.A. history book &quot;PASS IT ON&quot; says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Whatever Bill's reason, he unwittingly picked the strongest
Oxford Grouper among all of Akron's
clergymen.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt136" target="_blank">136</a></sup></font>
<p>
Bill Wilson claimed that he had
<font color="#4f007f">
'scored what he liked to call a &quot;ten strike&quot;'</font>
by choosing to call Rev.
Tunks.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt137" target="_blank">137</a></sup></font>
Not so.
<p>
And of course Rev. Tunks sent Bill to other Oxford Group members. That wasn't any
big coincidence or 'Divine Providence', either.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Walter Tunks was one of the founding members of the Akron Oxford Group. As such,
he was someone of whom Sam Shoemaker and other New York Oxford Group members
were certainly aware. As for Henrietta Seiberling, given the Oxford Group's penchant
for celebrity and Tunks's position in the Akron Oxford Group chapter, that Tunks
himself did not know Henrietta Seiberling and her efforts to help Robert Smith
seems hardly credible.<br>

<p>
The Oxford Group had gotten established in Akron because some Groupers
succeeded in temporarily sobering up Russell Firestone, the prodigal son of the tire millionaire
Harvey Firestone. The senior Firestone was so grateful that he bankrolled a
big Oxford Group campaign in Akron that established an enduring chapter.
The Akron Oxford Group had an established history and practice of
working with alcoholics, so Rev. Tunks wasn't overly surprised by
Bill Wilson asking to speak with another alcoholic.
<p>
So, another of Bill Wilson's biographers wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,s

Because of Tunks's Oxford Group affiliation, he was familiar with reformed
drunkards, and he was unreservedly receptive to Wilson's seemingly bizarre
request that he needed help making contact with another alcoholic.<br>

Bill Wilson met
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Dr_Bob2" target="_blank">Doctor Robert Smith,
a tragic wrecked old alcoholic and discredited doctor</a>, the next day.
The two of them took a liking to each other.
They spent the afternoon and evening talking about their mutual problem with alcoholism.
Dr. Bob didn't drink while talking with Bill Wilson that evening.
<p>
Henrietta was so impressed that she arranged for Bill to stay in Akron
longer and longer, just to help keep Dr. Bob sober.
Henrietta Seiberling really loved Bill Wilson in the summer of 1935,
and considered him a &quot;God-send&quot; and &quot;manna from Heaven&quot;
for his help in sobering up Doctor Bob. (She would later become
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Henrietta" target="_blank">one of Bill's harshest critics</a>,
after she got to know him better.)
Bill ended up staying in Akron for all of the summer
of 1935, living rent free and happily unemployed, getting free
food and cigarettes and spare change from somewhere.

<p>
Bill talked Doctor Bob into quitting drinking, and then,
together, they set out to convert other alcoholics to their Buchmanite
religious beliefs.
They were convinced that religious mania &#8212; that is, joining the Oxford Group &#8212;
was a working cure for alcoholism.
<p>
<a name="recruiting"> </a>
During the spring and summer of 1935,
Bill and Bob started up their &quot;Alcoholic Squad&quot; of The
Oxford Group &#8212; the &quot;anonymous bunch of alcoholics&quot; that
would eventually become Alcoholics Anonymous.
They went recruiting in the hospitals of Akron where Dr. Bob's status
as a doctor got them access to alcoholic patients.

<p>
The book <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i> describes how Dr. Bob
and Bill Wilson shoved their new &quot;treatment&quot; on A.A. Number Three, Bill Dotson,
when he was in the hospital, and forced Oxford Group religious conversions on other alcoholics,
no matter whether they wished to be converted or not:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... they thought it a good idea to have a preliminary talk with his wife.
And this became part of the way things were done in the early days: Discuss
it first with the wife; find out what you could; then plan your approach.
It should be noted, as well, that the alcoholic himself didn't ask for help.
He didn't have anything to say about it.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were such arrogant Oxford Group recruiters that they actually felt
entitled to shove their Oxford Group cult religion quack cure on sick
alcoholics regardless of the patient's wishes or beliefs &#8212; the patient
didn't get any say in the matter of religious conversion. (That is still the attitude of many
so-called counselors and therapists today.)

<p>
Nan Robertson described Doctor Bob's method of
treating new alcoholics and recruiting them for the Oxford Group:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Hospitalization was considered to be a must. Bob would circumvent
hospital rules against putting alcoholics in private rooms by
concocting another diagnosis and smuggling them in so that he could
work on likely prospects without distractions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The doctor and his recovering alcoholic friends would pay frequent
visits to the bedside. They told their drinking stories. Patients
would reply, as one of them reported, &quot;That's me. That's me.
I drink like that.&quot; Usually the sick man would spend five or six
days in the hospital being detoxified (medically withdrawn from
alcohol). In the final days his visitors would ask the prospect
to give over his life &quot;to the care and direction of the
Creator.&quot; Then the man would get down on his knees. When he
&quot;surrendered to God,&quot; he was considered a member.
Those who did not &quot;make their surrender&quot; in the hospital
did it soon afterward at an Oxford Group meeting, usually in the
home of T. Henry and Clarace Williams.<br>

<p>
<a name="Hallmark"> </a>
Alcoholics Anonymous publicity like the Hallmark made-for-TV movie &quot;My Name is Bill W.&quot;
tells the story that Bill W. and Dr. Bob started Alcoholics Anonymous immediately,
and went recruiting for Alcoholics Anonymous in Akron hospitals.
That is simply not true at all. William Borchert, the author of the screenplay, was rewriting
history there.  The Bill and Bob team were recruiting for the Oxford Group.
There was no such thing as &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.
Borchert also failed to mention the fact that the cult founder and leader,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman, was attending
Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and <i>Sieg-Heiling</i> Adolf Hitler</a>
while Bill and Bob recruited new followers for him.

<p>
The truth is that Bill and Bob were convinced that the Oxford Group had the
cure for alcoholism, and <i>The Answer</i> was to become a religious maniac:
<b>&quot;The only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;</b>

During the Spring and Summer of 1935, Bill and Bob recruited new members
for the Oxford Group cult religion.
The newly-recruited alcoholic Oxford Group members usually attended the Oxford Group meetings
at the large Westfield home of T. Henry and Clarace Williams.
But before they could attend, they had to &quot;make a surrender&quot;.
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender2Bob1" target="_blank">Dr. Bob actually demanded</a>
that the sick alcoholics get out of bed at the hospital
and get on their knees before him, and
&quot;surrender to God&quot;, before they were allowed to go
to their first Oxford Group meeting.
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#autocrat_Bob" target="_blank">Dr. Bob was a religious nutcase</a>.

<p>
<a name="alcoholics_not_welcome"> </a>
The story that
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob
started Alcoholics Anonymous in 1935 is a complete fairy tale &#8212; no truth to it whatsover.
Bill and Bob started recruiting for the Oxford Group in 1935.
And over in Cleveland, Clarence Synder was soon doing the same  &#8212;  recruiting
more alcoholics for Dr. Frank Buchman's religious cult.
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith and Clarence Snyder
built up their &quot;bunch of anonymous alcoholics&quot; group within
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult for the first two or three or four years (two in New York, four in Akron, three in Cleveland),
until Frank Buchman's other disciples grew tired of them.
The alcoholics weren't rich (except for the young Firestone Tire Company
heir Russell Firestone); they weren't famous; they
couldn't be manipulated through guilt induction; they mainly
wanted to just recruit more poor down-and-out
alcoholics; and the other Oxford Group members didn't like them.
The alcoholics were poor, shabby, and smelly, not the kind of crowd
that you want to be seen with at the Waldorf-Astoria.

<p>
The whole Oxford Group strategy was to convert rich, powerful,
and famous people, and then publicize their names for all they
were worth, in order to attract more rich, powerful, and famous
people (who could, presumably, give Frank Buchman big donations).
Shabby down-and-out penniless alcoholics who wanted to stay anonymous
didn't fit in with Oxford Group meetings held in glittering palaces like the
Waldorf-Astoria and the Plaza Hotel.
<p>
Eventually, the Oxford Group started hinting that Bill Wilson and his alcoholics should take a hike.


<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>
<a name="kicked"> </a>
It seems that there is some question, and some controversy, over the
question of whether Bill Wilson chose to leave the Oxford Group, or
was told to leave. The &quot;friends of Bill Wilson&quot; like to
claim that Wilson left voluntarily because he had a higher mission
than Frank Buchman.
But a more realistic reading of history indicates that the Oxford
Group was tired of Bill Wilson.

<p>
Rev. Sam Shoemaker remained above the fray, but gave tacit permission to his
assistant for him to edge the alcoholics out by slandering the Wilsons and declaring
that they were &quot;not maximum&quot;, and instructing the alcoholics
at the Calvary House mission not to attend the Oxford Group meetings at the Wilsons' house.
<p>
Robert Thomsen wrote a fairly good book about Bill Wilson,
called simply &quot;<i>Bill W.</i>&quot;,
which is good in spite of Thomsen's <i>very</i> pro-A.A. bias and occasional twisting of the facts in favor
of Bill Wilson.
Thomsen was presumably an unpublicized A.A. member, because he
was a personal friend
and co-worker of Bill Wilson's for the last 12 years of Bill's life.
Thomsen's account of everything is always 100% compatible with
the standard party line, which isn't surprising when you consider
the fact that the book is said to be based on a set of autobiographical
tape recordings that Bill Wilson made before his death.
Nevertheless, the book provides a lot of interesting details
about the history of A.A., like:
<br>
<a name="not_maximum"> </a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One evening Bill discovered that alcoholics from the mission
had been forbidden to come to Clinton Street, and at the large
O.G. [Oxford Group] gatherings it was bandied about that,
after all, the Wilsons
were not &quot;really maximum,&quot; a phrase that was foreign to Bill and
Lois, but nonetheless upsetting. Finally, what was referred to as
the divergent work of this secret group became the subject of a
Sunday-morning sermon at Calvary. Yet, in a curious way, instead
of distressing Bill and his associates, this criticism stiffened
their resolve.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i><b>Bill W.</b></i>, Robert Thomsen, page 256.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&quot;Clinton Street&quot; was Bill and Lois' house, where Bill was holding Oxford
Group meetings for alcoholics. The &quot;mission&quot; was Calvary House,
Sam Shoemaker's Episcopal church at 4th Avenue and 21st Street in New York City.
The phrase &quot;not maximum&quot; was a slur that meant that someone was
not totally committed to following the dictates of the cult leader,
Frank Buchman (although the official explanation was, of course, that someone
was not totally committed to doing &quot;the Will of God&quot;).
The Oxford Group came to see Bill Wilson as doing his own thing,
and not &quot;God's Will&quot;,
so he was increasingly unwelcome at Oxford Group meetings.
That is hardly surprising, considering Bill's stubborn, willful arrogance
and his messianic complex, as well as his obsession with alcoholics.

<p>
Bill Wilson and Lois felt that that denunciation was tantamount to an expulsion from the Oxford group.
Bill and Lois took their crowd of alcoholics and left in the spring of 1937.
Sam Shoemaker and Frank Buchman then claimed that they had been betrayed by Wilson's sudden
desertion, and would not talk to the Wilsons for many years afterwards.

<p>
<a name="authoritarian"> </a>
The following quote is Bill Wilson's own words, describing some of
the difficulties that led to the break-up:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Oxford Group also had attitudes and practices which added up to a
highly coercive authority. This was exercised by &quot;teams&quot; of older members.
They would gather in meditation and receive specific guidance for the
life conduct of newcomers. This guidance could cover all possible situations
from the most trivial to the most serious. If the directions so obtained
were not followed, the enforcement machinery began to operate. It consisted
of a sort of coldness and aloofness which made recalcitrants feel they
weren't wanted. At one time, for example, a &quot;team&quot; got guidance for me
to the effect that I was no longer to work with alcoholics. This I could not accept.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>N.C.C.A. 'Blue Book'</i>, Vol. 12, 1960.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's kind of funny, in a way. Bill Wilson was not bothered by Frank Buchman praising
Adolf Hitler and creating a big furor and publicly embarrassing the whole Oxford Group.
That was okay; neither Bill Wilson nor Doctor Bob quit the Oxford Group in protest
when Frank Buchman thanked Heaven for giving us Adolf Hitler.
They didn't have any problems with Frank Buchman's Fascist leanings, or anything else
about that strange cult. (Bill Wilson stayed in the Oxford Group for another year after
Frank Buchman's <i>&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler&quot;</i>
newspaper inteview, and Dr. Bob stayed in for another three years.)
Bill and Dr. Bob were happy true believers in Buchmanism, such
happy true believers that they would duplicate it and make it into their own cult.
(Or more accurately, they just stole a branch of the Oxford Group cult and made it their own.)
But when the Oxford Group elders tried to tell Bill Wilson what to do,
and expected Bill to obey orders, well, that was unacceptable...


<p>
Undoubtedly, the bad feelings between William Wilson and the
Oxford Group were mutual. The Oxford Group wasn't big enough for two
over-bearing, arrogant, deceitful, insane
cult leaders like Frank N. D. Buchman and William G. Wilson, both of
whom were going to do whatever they damn well pleased...
<p>
Doctor Bob, on the other hand, stayed in the good graces of the
Akron Oxford Group for two years longer, before making a clean break of it.
So did Clarence Snyder.

<p>
Then Bill and Dr. Bob and Clarence Snyder set up their own independent organization, with the same
religious beliefs, customs, and practices as the Oxford Group, except that
now Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob and Clarence Snyder provided the leadership, not Frank Buchman.

When Bill Wilson wrote the opening chapters of the manual for the organization,
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
(popularly known as &quot;The Big Book&quot;), Wilson carefully hid
&#8212; or erased &#8212; most all of the connections to Frank Buchman
and The Oxford Group, because the Catholic Church was unhappy
with Buchmanism, and there was a very good chance that the Church
would ban it. (Eventually,
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban" target="_blank">the Pope did</a> &#8212; he ordered that no
Catholics go to Oxford Group meetings.)
Bill didn't want to lose all of the Catholics.
So Bill also renamed confession to
&quot;sharing&quot; throughout the program, so as to not
offend the Catholic Church. (The Church has a rule against public confession.)
Likewise, Bill declared that A.A. was a
&quot;spiritual program&quot;, rather than a
religion, also to avoid a conflict with the Catholic Church.
The Oxford Group had called itself
&quot;More spiritual than religious&quot;, and Wilson just took it
one step further when he declared that Alcoholics Anonymous was
a &quot;spiritual fellowship&quot;, and not a religion at all.

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Forward to the 2nd Edition,
William G. Wilson, page XX (of the 3rd edition).</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also, there was Frank Buchman's public admiration of Adolf Hitler and too-cozy
friendliness with the Nazis, and
the Oxford Group was increasingly being criticized for arrogance due to
the Oxford Group's belief that they alone were sane and getting direct
messages from God while everybody else was insane,
and also for undercutting other churches, hypocrisy, gross dishonesty,
self-congratulatory sanctimoniousness, and an inability to tolerate
criticism. So Bill thought it best to not mention that Alcoholics Anonymous
ever had anything to do with Frank Buchman...

<p>
<a name="William_James"> </a>
In the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Bill Wilson proudly
bragged about connections
to William James and his book <i>Varieties of Religious
Experience</i>, and to Carl Jung, and
claimed that they were the philosophical parents of Alcoholics Anonymous. But
William James and Carl Jung really
only contributed one single line, one single idea, each (at most, if that).
Bill got the idea of intense, soul-shaking religious
experiences in times of great stress, pain, sickness and despair from
<i>Varieties</i>. And Bill
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland" target="_blank"><b><i>supposedly</i></b></a> got the
idea of substituting religious mania for alcoholism &#8212; substituting
<i>religiomania</i> for <i>dipsomania</i> &#8212; from Carl Jung. But that's it.
Everything else that made up Alcoholics Anonymous came from the Oxford Group,
or
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery" target="_blank">other temperance
societies that came before A.A.</a>.

<p>
Bill Wilson carefully hid the whole Oxford Group history of Alcoholics Anonymous
when he wrote the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>.
Years later, after people had forgotten about Frank Buchman, Wilson
allowed a few more details and hints of those early days to slip
through the filter, and appear in semi-official A.A. literature.

<p>
Poor old Frank Buchman got very little credit, just two tiny mentions
for the Oxford Group, <i>only</i> in the Forward to the Second Edition in 1955,
even though he contributed almost <i>everything else</i> that makes up the theology
and philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous.
So it goes. Such is life in the evangelist's game.

<p>
<a name="ftnt045_ret"> </a>
The references to the Oxford Group in the Forward to the Second Edition are:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Six months earlier, the
broker<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt045" target="_blank">45</a></sup></font>
had been relieved of his drink
obsession by a sudden spiritual experience, following a meeting
with an alcoholic friend who had been in contact with the Oxford
Groups of that day.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson, pages xv to xvi.</font>
<p>
<font color="blue" size="-1">
(Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt045" target="_blank">not a stock broker either</a>.
That was another one of his grandiose but completely untrue claims.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though he could not accept all the tenets of the Oxford Groups, he was
convinced of the need for moral inventory, confession of
personality defects, restitution to those harmed, helpfulness to
others, and the necessity of belief in and dependence
upon God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson, page xvi.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is hardly a ringing endorsement, and it is deceptive as can be.
That is like pointing at your mother, and saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Yes, I met that old woman, and talked to her on more than one occasion,
but I couldn't agree with her about everything.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<a name="too_good_too_soon"> </a>
And, actually, Bill Wilson <i>did</i> accept all of the tenets of the
Oxford Groups. The only one that he didn't accept was the one about having
Frank Buchman and the other Oxford Group elders as his bosses,
to be obeyed in all matters, large and small.
Bill Wilson was and remained a true-believer Buchmanite for his whole life
&#8212; a Buchmanite who was just bad at following orders.
That statement about not being able to accept all of the tenets
of the Oxford Groups was a very dishonest statement &#8212; a dodge
to avoid being identified as a Buchmanite or being associated with
Frank Buchman and his Oxford Groups.
<p>
Bill later described that practice of deception like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only
little by little. They simply did not want to get &quot;too good
too soon.&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank">
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts</a> &#8212; absolute
purity, absolute honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212;
were frequently too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed
with teaspoons rather than by buckets.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>
</font>

William G. Wilson, pages 74-75.

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
So don't tell newcomers the whole truth; don't tell them what
membership in the cult really entails, or what the cult is; just dole out the
real facts a tiny bit at a time &#8212; only a teaspoonful of truth at a time &#8212;
to keep them coming back for more meetings and indoctrination.</i></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Note how Bill Wilson slandered his fellow alcoholics, saying that
they didn't want to let go of their defects, and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">they didn't want to get
&quot;too good too soon&quot;</a>,
and that
the Buchmanite &quot;Absolute&quot; goodness was just too much
for them (even though it wasn't too much for the High Holy Alcoholic
Bill Wilson, who could handle such lofty spirituality).
<p>
<li>
Likewise, Bill declared that the newcomers to A.A.
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">were morally inferior to him</a>
because they didn't like the fascist, authoritarian nature of the
Oxford Groups.
<p>
<li>
Later, Bill would make a very profitable career out of
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">raving about how bad
alcoholics really are</a>.
<p>
<li> Bill Wilson also believed that the newcomers to A.A. were stupid &#8212; that
he could shove Frank Buchman's religion on his new A.A. members without
them realizing what was happening if he just changed the wording,
using different names for things, to
confuse his new converts and keep them unaware of what kind of religion
they were really getting. That practice is called
<i><a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">Deceptive Recruiting</a></i>,
which is some more standard cult behavior.
</ul>

<p>
Bill Wilson inserted many new stories into the second edition of
the <i>Big Book</i> in 1955, including
the story <i>&quot;He Thought He Could Drink Like A Gentleman&quot;</i>,
by Abby G. of Cleveland, which mentions the Oxford Group.
By that time, the furor over Frank Buchman, the Oxford Group Movement,
and Moral Re-Armament had
died down, so Wilson allowed one more small mention of the Oxford Group to
slip through the filter.
Abby's story tells us that in the early days of A.A. in Akron:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I had attended several of these meetings before I discovered that
all of those who were there were not alcoholics.
That is, it was sort of a mixed bunch of Oxford Groupers, who were interested
in the alcohol problem, and of alcoholics themselves.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, page 218.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="Shoemaker1"> </a>
Then, finally, many, many, years later, Bill Wilson admitted that the Twelve Steps
came from the Oxford Group recruiting and indoctrination practices:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got its ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Language of the Heart</i>, William G. Wilson, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that Bill was still being deceptive and dishonest there: Frank Buchman
was still extremely unpopular when Bill wrote that, hated by many for his
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#praise_Hitler" target="_blank">Hitler-praising fascism</a>
and
<a href="orange-rroot420.html" target="_blank">draft-dodging ways</a>,
so Wilson invoked the name of Dr. Samuel Shoemaker as the leader of
Frank Buchman's cult religion.
But all of the &quot;spiritual substance&quot; that Wilson was talking
about came straight from Frank Buchman, and Frank Buchman was really
the leader of the organization. It was almost irrelevant who the
manager of the American branch was, but Sam Shoemaker's name sure
sounded better than Frank Buchman's.

<p>
Bill was being deceptive and dishonest there in another way too:
&quot;The early AAs&quot; did not &quot;find&quot; the material for the 12 Steps.
Bill Wilson just wrote down the standard recruiting and indoctrination
 practices, like the &quot;Five C's&quot;, and the
&quot;Six Practices of the Sane&quot;, that the Oxford Groups
used to &quot;change&quot; the minds of new recruits, and convert
and indoctrinate them in the ways of Buchmanism.
The early A.A.s did not &quot;find&quot; the mind-bending practices
that are in the Twelve Steps. They did not discover, by trial and error,
some methods that worked to make alcoholics quit drinking.
(The story that they did is another historical falsehood that William Borchert put in the
script of &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;.)

Bill Wilson rationalized his deception and hiding of the Oxford Group
roots of Alcoholics Anonymous with this explanation:

&quot;I am often asked why I do not publicly acknowledge my very real debt of gratitude

establish a connection between the O.G. and Alcoholics Anonymous which does
not exist at the present time. I had to ask myself which was the more important:
that the O.G. receive credit and that I have the pleasure of so discharging
my debt of gratitude, or that alcoholics everywhere have the best possible
chance to stay alive regardless of who gets credit.&quot;<br>

Notice the numerous propaganda tricks in that paragraph:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#slanted" target="_blank"><i>Slanted Language</i></a>:
<ul>
<li>
People who disliked Nazis and Nazi sympathizers like Dr. Frank Buchman and
his Oxford Groups were &quot;unreasoningly prejudiced&quot;.
<li>
In a noble act of self-sacrifice, Bill Wilson deprived himself of
&quot;pleasure&quot; when he didn't tell the truth.
<li> Bill also claimed that he was so noble that he didn't care &quot;who gets credit&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#non_sequitur" target="_blank"><i>Non Sequitur</i></a> &#8212; goofy logic.
Bill worried that he might
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;establish a connection between the O.G. and Alcoholics Anonymous
which does not exist at the present time &quot;</font>
if he told the truth about the history of Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>
<p>
Nonsense. The Oxford Group had ceased to exist by then, so there was no need to
worry about establishing a present connection. We can't know precisely when Bill
Wilson made that statement, but it was probably late in his life, both from the sound
of it, and because the book <i>PASS IT ON</i> was published in 1984.
The Oxford Group had ceased, morphed into Moral Re-Armament, back in 1939, and then MRA
died out in the 'forties and 'fifties.
By 1970, M.R.A. was nothing but the <i>Up With People</i> song-and-dance show, with
an office in London and the hotels at Caux, Switzerland, and Mackinac Island, Michigan.

Even today, the official A.A. position regarding the Oxford Groups is
still largely a cover-up. The A.A. history book <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>,
written by the staff of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS),
says, in explaining the reasons for the split between the Oxford Group
and the fledgling group of &quot;anonymous alcoholics&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There was one more reason, which never came out publicly:
Frank Buchman, founder and leader of the Oxford Group, was not only
trying to influence political and business affairs on an international
level, but was regarded by some as being in sympathy with Hitler,
following a widely publicized interview with Buchman in 1936.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i><b>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</b></i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., page 155.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Frank Buchman publicly declared to a New York daily newspaper,
the New York <i>World Telegram</i>,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;</i></font>,
and AAWS only says that Buchman
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;was regarded by some as being in sympathy with Hitler&quot;</font>.
Now that's good old-fashioned stereotypical alcoholic
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">minimization and denial</a>.
<p>
And what do they mean by
<font color="#af0000">
&quot;There was one more reason, which never came out
publicly&quot;</font>?<br>
How could any of that sensational affair not come out publicly?
Are they admitting that the A.A. organization has been hiding facts
and deceiving people ever since 1937? What happened to,
<font color="#af0000">
&quot;grasping and developing a manner of living which demands
rigorous honesty&quot;</font>?
<font size="-1">
(The <i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
[<i>Also see Charles Bufe's description of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context" target="_blank">how the AAWS staff
quoted Frank Buchman out of context</a>
to make him sound less like a Nazi sympathizer.</i>]
</font>

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

So, anyway, Frank Buchman is dead and gone, and the whole
Buchmanism / Oxford Group / Moral Re-Armament religious organization
is dead and gone, and it's all history, right?
<p>
No, unfortunately, that isn't quite true.
<p>
Buchmanism lives on in Alcoholics
Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">the whole host of other twelve-step programs</a>,
and it is far, far more popular and more powerful
now than it ever was when Frank Buchman was alive. Alcoholics
Anonymous simply <i><b>is</b></i> Buchmanism, dressed up in a
shabbier suit of clothes. (Not in a new suit of clothes &#8212; that's what Frank Buchman's
millionaires were wearing. Bill's down and out alcoholics were dressed in ragged threadbare
old suits. A.A. is downscale Buchmanism.)
<p>
I recall that Shakespeare, in the
play <i>Julius Caesar</i>, had Mark Anthony say,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>&quot;The evil that men do lives after them;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The good is oft' interred with their bones.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

That surely is true of Frank Buchman and his sick, weird, twisted cult religion.
Like a vampire that you can't even kill with a wooden stake &#8212; one that
to your horror keeps rising again from the grave &#8212; Buchmanism refuses to die.
Frankenstein's monster may be dead, but <i>Son of Frankenstein</i> lives
on...
