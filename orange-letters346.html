From:  	&quot;Rahul K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	The meetings really _are_ a joke<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I got sober (without AA) about three years ago (I actually emailed you two
years ago, when I was quitting smoking and reflecting on my quitting
experience). I don't attend meetings and never really have, but about every
six months, I get the urge to talk to someone and I start to think, &quot;Oh,
you know, there are whole huge circles of people who are dealing with my
problems.&quot; And then I go to a meeting.

<p>
I always leave feeling worse than when I entered.

<p>
Today was the worst. I've been feeling somewhat depressed lately (some kind
of brain chemical thing), and I've been having the urge to drink. So I went
to the meeting and stood up and told people that I was really depressed and
even though I knew that drinking would screw me up, I just felt myself
teetering on that edge. Okay, no cross-talk, so everyone went on with their
stories, telling their own sobriety narratives. After the meeting, I tried
to talk to some people, said, &quot;Hey&quot; and &quot;Thanks for speaking&quot; and all that.
No one asked me any questions. No one acknowledged what I'd said. No one
even said, &quot;Hang in there.&quot; All that I got was &quot;keep coming back.&quot; I was
the *only* newcomer at the meeting.

<p>
You know, I used to think that something was wrong with me, because I'd go
to meetings and no one would ever talk to me. I thought that maybe I wasn't
putting myself out there enough or something. Well, fuck that. I mean, I
don't ask for that much. Sometimes I just want to talk to someone.
Sometimes I just want someone to tell me that things will be okay. Isn't
that what the meeting is for? But no one ever does that. At least not in
the meetings I've gone to. Somehow, the culture of AA is just very cold and
very unfeeling. Sometimes, I *wish* it was a cult. A cult would pay far
more attention to the people who walk in the door than AA does. I never
feel so lonely and so isolated as after a meeting.

<p>
I'm strong enough to push through this. I have an appointment with a
*real* therapist
tomorrow. But I feel so sorry for all the people who walk into those rooms
with the faith that someone is actually going to listen to them and try to
help them.

<p>
The one thing that came out of today's meeting is a promise to myself. I am
never going to go to another meeting for as long as I live.

<p>
Keep up the good work! Without you, so many people would continue to think
that AA is the only way to quit drinking. I am sure that your site saves
lives.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Rahul

<p>
P.S. At least this has given me one more reason to stay sober. If I started
drinking again, all my AA-affiliated friends would tell themselves that it
was because I'd been &quot;white-knuckling&quot; it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rahul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are keeping your head screwed on straight,
in spite of your difficulties.

<p>
What you say is just so true. I went through the same experience when I went to my second-ever
A.A. meeting and &quot;shared&quot; that I had gone into DT's the previous night because I had just quit
drinking. Nobody batted an eye or said a word. Utter silence. No reaction.
I felt like I must have said something really wrong. I just got cold silence.

<p>
Now in fairness to them, a couple of people did come and talk to me after the meeting, and give
me some advice about how to get through the withdrawal.
But still, the meeting format is unnatural and spooky.
&quot;No cross-talk&quot;? Give me a break. What is natural is back-and-forth conversing.

<p>
Your story reveals one of the fundamental problems with A.A.: expecting to get help from people
who are not in good shape themselves.
Apparently, you went to a meeting where the people were so worried about their own
recoveries that they couldn't pay any attention to yours.
<p>
I am reminded of something that someone said to me years ago:

<p>

<p>
Yes indeed. Sometimes, you might as well just go to the local mental hospital and ask the inmates
for advice and instructions on how to live.

<p>
I like your decision to go find a real therapist.

<p>
Oh, and about your little &quot;resentment&quot; where you won't relapse and give them the satisfaction
of seeing you fail, I feel the same way too. That occurs to me every so often. I
can't possibly relapse now, because if I did, there would be laughing and crowing and
celebrations in A.A. clubhouses all over America. No way in Hell. Not gonna happen.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Disease of Perception<br>

<p>
Hi Orange
<p>
I was wondering if you had any thoughts or knowledge of the whole &quot;disease
of perception&quot; term. I went to AA in a Clancy group and while doing a
google search it appears he's the one that created the whole thing. Looking
back, I don't remember it even being in the big book. It's a really great
tool to control people's minds though. I had to go into a cult recovery
center after leaving the group... they really did a number on me. They had
me believing my personality traits were part of my illness (like being
introverted) and that anything I said or did that wasn't in line with how
they acted, however small, was seen as rebellion, unwillingness, or my
illness again. I was always a bad or sick person. That is how thought
reform works. I was completely shunned when I left as well. Just like a
cult!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Emily,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question. I had not heard of that &quot;disease
of perception&quot; before, but I can guess what it means. &quot;You don't see correctly.
Your mind doesn't work right.&quot;
<p>
That brings up several of the standard cult characteristics that mess with people's minds:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong" target="_blank">2. You are always wrong.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">33. Newcomers can't think right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">67. Don't Trust Your Own Mind.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">68. Don't Feel Your Own Feelings.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_cant_without" target="_blank">84. You can't make it without the group.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">90. Newcomers Need Fixing.</a>
</ul>
<p>
And yes, it is a really great
tool to control people's minds. Make them doubt themselves and believe that they are
too insane and flawed to save themselves, and they will obey the leader &#8212;
the leader who supposedly has the magical ability to fix them.

<p>
And yes, it really is a cult. And Clancy Imusland's &quot;Pacific Group&quot; is one of the worst
branches of Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; it's an extremist subcult within a cult. 
There are many more stories about Clancy and his subcult here:<br>
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Stories about Clancy Imusland's <i>Pacific Group</i></a><br>
By the way, I'm adding your letter to the list.

<p>

Yes, it's the end of an era, isn't it? I always feel a little sad to see the old communes

<p>
Hello-

<p>
I don't know if someone is actually going to read this.  My user name is &quot;racinemike&quot;.

<p>
If you can read this. I'm very troubled by what I see in AA. I've been sober for
nearly 4 years.

<p>
I'm not an atheist.  I do live with major depression.  I had a horrible childhood.
I was beaten and killed almost twice by my dad who was a police officer.  My mother
was a heavy drinker.  I'm also gay so I have always felt different.

<p>
I was a 6 figure businessman.  Sucessfull despite everything.  I got hit all at once
with some life events that made me drink even more.  Family members dying, the
economy tanking.  My partner at the time not paying the mortgage. Since I joined AA
nearly 4 years ago I'm involved in a group that only lives by the precepts of the
big book.  There is a chain of sponsorship.  grandsponsor, Great gransponsor etc,
running up to Clancy.

<p>
I see very little compassion in AA.  I'm not looking for sympathy.  But have been
told to look at my part in childhood abuse. What the hell?  I understand the
precepts of forgiveness. But I get scared for some people that are new 1-2 years
that are addressing abuse issues.  I would never tell anyone to look at their part
if they were an abused child.

<p>
My sponsor rarely if ever gets back to me.  Wants me to write another 4th step.  I
feel like I get the shit kicked out of me.  I do suffer for low self esteem.
Although on the outside most people judge me and think how can he have low self
esteem.

<p>
I see some people treated like outsiders and others that relapse and come back in as
near celebrties.  It seems like a popularity contest.  Add an AA club to the mix and
the lines get very blurred.

<p>
Anyway, I'm looking for a way out.  I don't know which way to go. I'm terrified to
speak out. There are a few that see through it all but.

<p>
Anyway, thank you for your website.  I'm looking for hope.

<p>
Take Care,,

<p>
Mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I says a lot. And I can certainly sympathize. I was the abused son of
an alcoholic military sergeant father, and my childhood was hell. I'm 66 years old now, and I'm
still working on getting rid of the bad memories, and worse, the deep-seated feelings of failure and inadequacy
and inferiority because I wasn't everything that my father wanted. (I was a straight-A
student in school, but that wasn't enough because I wasn't any good at athletics. He wanted a
son who was also a super-star athlete. Oh, and he also wanted a perfect little soldier to boot.)
I would like to say that &quot;Time heals all wounds&quot;, but it hasn't happened yet. 
<p>
Which brings up those 4th and 5th Steps. Please stop that self-damaging routine right now.
You already have enough problems without putting yourself down and criticizing yourself some more.
The Twelve Steps are just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's rewrite</a>
of Dr. Frank Buchman's cult recruiting and indoctrination
routines. The reason that the 12 Steps never tell you to quit drinking is because they are not
about quitting drinking, they are about getting brainwashed into being a cult member.
<p>
Check out this cheat sheet on cults and brainwashing:
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">Dr. Robert J. Lifton's description of brainwashing techniques</a>.
<p>
Dr. Lifton was one of the original researchers into brainwashing. The USA was shocked when the Korean
War ended and American POWs came back denouncing America and praising the Communists.
They had been brainwashed. So Dr. Lifton and Dr. Edgar H. Schein studied the victims of brainwashing
to learn how it works.  Well, Dr. Lifton 
summarized brainwashing as using eight specific conditions, which are listed at that link. You will find that
the A.A. program does all eight of them. The 12-Step program is brainwashing, period.
<p>
(I can't help but wonder whether the Chinese Communists learned something from Dr. Frank Buchman,
who developed and popularized his techniques back in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties,
long before the Chinese Communists ever thought about brainwashing. And Dr. Frank Buchman
went to China as a missionary, so there is a real chance that the Chinese did learn some of that
stuff from him. There is a Ph.D. project for a historian.)

<p>
So please stop doing that and hurting yourself.
<p>
Then, I notice that you are in one of Clancy's cults. Oh God. That is the worst part of A.A.
Clancy's groups like the Pacific Group, Atlantic Group, Midtown Group, Foxhall Group, and &quot;The Nursery&quot;
and &quot;the Badger Group&quot; are the most extreme and radical branch of A.A.  Please get out of there.
<p>
There are many more horror stories about Clancy and his subcult here:
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Stories about Clancy Imusland's <i>Pacific Group</i>,
Atlantic Group, and Foxhall Group</a>.
<p>
And the Midtown Group, run by Clancy's grand-sponsee Mike Quinones, is described here:
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html" target="_blank">Stories of the Midtown Group of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

<p>
You fear that something bad will happen to you if you leave A.A. I can happily tell you that it isn't so.
I have 12 years off of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs now, and I haven't been to an A.A. or N.A. meeting in
nearly 11 years.
<p>
What they are doing to you is called Phobia Induction, and it's a standard feature of cults. They always
claim that something horrible will happen if you quit the cult.  The Devil will get you, or you will be
trapped in Samsara, or you will go insane, or you won't get taken up to Heaven in the Rapture,
or you won't get the promised Miracle, or you will relapse and die from drugs and alcohol. It's always something.
Here are the Cult Test question and answer for Phobia Induction:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank">34. The Group Implants Phobias.</a> == question
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">34. The Group Implants Phobias.</a> == answer
</ul>

<p>
Also, forget about that talk about &quot;finding your part in it.&quot; You were a child, and had
no choice about getting abused. As if us abused children <i>CHOSE</i> to get abused? That is barking-mad insanity.
That is just the cult inducing feelings of inadequacy and guilt.
That is also a standard cult characteristic, or rather, several of them:
<ul>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_q4.html#cq_powerlessness" target="_blank">43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>  == question
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_new_identity" target="_blank">75. New Identity &#8212; Redefinition of Self &#8212; Revision of Personal History</a> == question
<p>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>  == answer
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_new_identity" target="_blank">75. New Identity &#8212; Redefinition of Self &#8212; Revision of Personal History</a> == answer
</ul>

<p>
Now for the good news. Yes, there is a way out. First off, you can just walk out and never go back.
You will not instantly die or relapse. You are keeping yourself clean and sober now, aren't you?
I know that the cult will deceive you and tell you that they are keeping you sober, but they aren't.
You are doing it yourself. You can continue to do it yourself without them.

<p>
Now that doesn't mean that you have to be alone. There are several good sensible, sane, non-cult
groups that can help. Here is the list of addresses:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>.
<p>
Personally, I have experience with SMART, and found it be some sane, realistic technology of the mind.
I've also communicated with
Jim Christopher, the founder of SOS, and he has good stuff to offer too.
And both are free. And they let you keep your mind and your soul, so you can't beat the price.

<p>
I would also get an appointment with a real doctor or psychiatrist to see if something can be done
about the depression. At least some meds to help you through the rough spots. Childhood abuse leads
to lots of depression. (Which just naturally leads into using too much alcohol and other drugs
as the victim tries to self-medicate and fix what's broken.)
I don't know of any easy magic cure there, but at least a good doctor can help, sometimes a lot.

<p>
Oh, and please beware of the fake tranquilizers that are on the market. We &#8212;
another abused child and I &#8212; were just discussing them in a previous letter
<a href="orange-letters336.html#Space_Okie2" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Good luck now, and please don't hesitate to write back. Let me know how you are doing.
Oh, and you are already approved and enabled in the forum.
<p>
And have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Paul K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	how it works?<br>

<p>
Hello again, Orange,

<p>
I have in the past expressed some ambivalent (sp?) thoughts and
feelings about AA.

<p>
I am 50 now and I first went to AA 22 years ago when I was 28 and when
I was forced into a 12 step based rehab for 3 months. At different
times since then I have attended AA. As I've written before my longest
periods of sobriety have been 18 months and 22 months.

<p>
I think I have now reached a stage with AA meetings where I feel I
have heard it all before. Also, I now just don't get much out of
sitting down for 90 minutes and listening to 7 or 8 AA members talk
about their drinking years and their lives now etc. Yet, there are
still some people in AA and NA that I both like and respect.

<p>
I agree with you that a lot of alcoholics stop drinking simply because
they get sick and tired of being sick and tired. And then after that I
do now think that will power is a factor in a alcoholic staying sober
for that first 3, 6 or 12 months. Then I think what often happens is
simply that a sober alcoholic forms the habit of living each day
without alcohol and that is combined with an alcoholic looking back
and associating drinking with pain, problems and humiliations etc and
then after a period of time, like say a year or so, an alcoholic can
see that life sober is just much more better, easier and trouble-free
etc; and then becomes determined to never return to all the misery
that goes with alcoholic drinking.

<p>
I now simply don't believe 90 meetings in 90 days etc and then still
going to meetings after 10 plus years of sobriety is necessary.

<p>
I am now seeing a D and A counsellor at Community Health. This
counsellor, like many others in Australia, takes a more CBT approach
than the 12 Steps approach; eg rational thinking with relapse
prevention; challenging self-defeating thoughts; not &quot;catastrophizing&quot;
or &quot;awfulizing&quot; over what are 95% of the time quite trivial matters,
when you think about it; and so on. I now get more out of this
counselling than AA.

<p>
As for spirituality, for the last 5 Sundays I have attended a small
local Christian church where I have found some peace in prayer and
worship. And the people there have been very friendly and welcoming.
There is coffee, tea and food and conversation etc for about an hour
after each Sunday service.

<p>
I really hope and pray that this time I can make it to 2 plus years
sobriety; and then maybe/hopefully stay sober till I die.

<p>
There have been some good people in AA who have offered me time,
advice and support but unlike them there is often, when I am sober, so
many more things I'd rather do than attend AA; simple things like
spending time with my girlfriend and her kids, going to the cinema,
and even going for long walks with our dogs or reading a good novel
etc.

<p>
There is a part of me that still wants to go to AA once or twice a
week to stay in touch with some people there that I like and respect.
But the problem is that there is now such a big gap in our thinking
about what it takes to achieve long term sobriety.

<p>
On top of all this, I have, as I've written before, a bipolar disorder
as well. And the D and A counsellor I am now seeing agrees with the
psychiatrist I have seen on and off for the past 7 years that if my
bipolar condition is properly medicated and managed then it just sort
of follows that to a large extent the problem of my episodes of
alcoholic drinking is solved too.

<p>
Paul

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. You have your head screwed on straight.
And of course I agree that you don't need any 90 in 90, or to go to meetings for 10 years and hear the same
stuff again and again.
<p>
You sound like you have a very good realistic take on the situation.
<p>
I understand that need for companionship. That is very human. I know that you would enjoy SMART or SOS
meetings more. You will get a saner grade of people to associate with there. Here is the list:
<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a><br>
<p>
And going to the church sounds good. I hope you find a bunch of happiness and comfort and companionship there.
<p>
It also sounds like you have a sane and competent counselor, which is very encouraging.

<p>
I totally agree with the statement that if your 
&quot;bipolar condition is properly medicated and managed then it just sort
of follows that to a large extent the problem of [your] episodes of
alcoholic drinking [will be] solved too.&quot; Yes.
But of course. The bipolar condition is why you started drinking excessively in
the first place.  You were just trying to self-medicate and fix what is broken,
and get to feeling right. Welcome to the club. Alas, alcohol is actually a very
poisonous bad drug that really messes you up after a while.  I think that just
about anything that you can get from the doctor would be better.

<p>
Oh, and obviously, you were not drinking because you were unspiritual and suffering
from &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and all
of that guilt-inducing nonsense that A.A. teaches. Bipolar disorder is not a sin
that you need to confess in a 5th Step.

<p>
About your questioning whether you can make it for two years, may I suggest that
in order to not make it, you would need to buy into one of the untrue lines that
old Lizard Brain Addiction Monster loves to jabber to get us to &quot;just have one&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Just one will be okay. I can handle it now. I deserve it. I need to relax. Just one won't
be any big deal. A whole year of no cheating whatsoever &#8212; I've got it licked, and I can
just kick back and relax now.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I get those thoughts every so often. But I recognize them for the bull that they
are, and reject them.  Please read this page, if you haven't already. It was a huge
help to me in staying sober for the first couple of years:

Another thing that that I do not like about AA.  &quot;Story Creep&quot;.  Have you heard
people's stories change and get worse?   I have felt the need to embellish myself in
the rooms.  &quot;Jeez, I didn't drink enough!&quot;   Why?   I know guys that swear they
drank a half gallon a day.  &quot;Really dude?  You may have drank FROM a half gallon
each day.  I know you, you were a semi-functional problem drinker just like me when
we met.  Now you are a half gallon a day bad ass a stone's throw away from liver
disease.  Come on.&quot;    This is applauded as &quot;getting honest&quot;.  I think it is
bullshit.

Hi Jack,
<p>
Oh yes. Right on. You hit the nail on the head. I am reminded of
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#reverse_denial">this quote from Andrew Meacham</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As an AA member from 1981 to 1988, I sometimes felt myself saying things
I did not mean and did not believe.
I would prepare to make a point in which I did believe and found myself
saying something like, &quot;Well, you know, before I got into the program
all I did was drink.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Somewhere within, I'd hear the sound of screeching brakes: &quot;What?!&quot;
It was a ridiculous statement. I had worked full-time (never missed a day
because of drinking), acted in dozens of theatrical productions, written
articles and short stories, dated, took vacations, read books, played
basketball &#8212; all during the time I was supposedly laid up drunk.
Yet for a long time it was very difficult not to practice this reverse denial.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As an individual blends into the ... [therapeutic community],
he redefines his past in terms of the new present.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So there is a difference between the &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;
exalted in AA literature, and the &quot;narrative bending&quot; that is
expected in the social reality of the AA program. The coercion can be
gentle and loving, or it can be harsh and upbraiding. But it is there;
shaping descriptions, &quot;suggesting&quot; vocabularies,
&quot;ever reminding us to place principles (theirs) before personalities
(our own).&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Principles before personalities&quot; is

of the Twelve Traditions.<br>

BLOG NOTE: 2013.03.10:
<p>
Some new guy who thinks he is a wildlife expert posted this sign at the Fernhill Wetlands, and he declared
that feeding the ducks and geese &quot;is not doing them any favors&quot;:
<p>
<center>
<img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/C5D_20130310_0221-Dont_Feed_Sign-800.png" width="800" height="810" border="3" bordercolor="blue" alt="Don't feed the wildlife sign">
</center>

<p>
This sign deserves an Oscar for the concentration of dishonest propaganda tricks, logical fallacies, and lies:
There are no fewer than seven logical fallacies, propaganda tricks, and lies, packed into just two sentences:

<p>
<ol>
<li> Malnutrition? Feedling the ducks and geese does not cause malnutrition.
They still eat plenty of greens. Any bread or grain that they get is just a treat,
a bonus. Their main diet is still grass for the geese, and various algae, pond scum,
and worms and insects for the ducks.
<p>
The only way that feeding geese and ducks bread and grain will cause malnutrition is if somebody locks them in
a cage and feeds them only bread and grain. That will make them get sick. They need their greens for a balanced
diet. But the free birds do not have that problem.

<p>
The author of that sign was using the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">
The Either/Or Technique &#8212; Bifurcation &#8212; the Excluded Middle</a>,

declaring that either the wildlife will get no food from people, or else they will
be living 100% on food from humans.
The author of that sign says
that if the geese or ducks get even a little bread or grain that they will suddenly
eat nothing else, and will get sick from malnutrition. That has no basis in fact.
There is no truth to it.

<p>
Wildfowl are not stupid. They have a good idea of what constitutes a balanced diet
for them. They know what they need to eat. They hunger for the things that are
good for them.  When I was hand-feeding Carmen, when
she was less than a week old, she
insisted on filling her stomach three-quarters full of grass first, and then she
would fill the remaining space with cooked rice. She never deviated from that
ratio, and she always insisted on eating the grass first. She was actually
born (hatched) with a built-in idea of what constituted good nutrition for her.
No way was she suffering from malnutrition.
<p>

Carmen standing on her plate of rice and graham cracker crumbs.
</center>


<p><li>
Overcrowding? If feeding the ducks and geese a little bread and grain suddenly
causes an increase in the population, then they were starving and dying, and
feeding them even a little saves them and keeps them alive.
Deliberately starving the wildlife to death is a crime &#8212; cruelty to animals.
And it's just plain heartless too.

<p>
Besides which, who defines &quot;overcrowding&quot;?
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#slanted" target="_blank">Using Slanted Language</a>.
And it is also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#undefined" target="_blank">Use Of Undefined Terminology</a>.
<p>
What population of geese would exist if they still had their ancient feeding grounds?
The normal habitat of Canada Geese is grassy meadows adjacent to rivers and lakes. They
need that habitat so that they can graze the grass, and then run for the water when a dog
or fox or wolf comes along. Since the babies cannot fly, they really need to be able
to run to the water fast.
Alas, grassy meadows next to rivers or lakes are prime pieces of bottomland.
White men came along and took those goose feeding grounds and plowed them up and made them
into farms a century ago, and now they complain that there are too many geese who want to feed
on their farms. And the farmers kill them.

<p>
That is the same treatment as the Indians got: First herd them onto reservations, and shoot the ones who
won't go onto the reservation, and then deny them food and watch them die out.
<p>
So much for the geese foraging for food in the wilderness.
<p>
What is really horrifying is the fact that you can go to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's web site
and download the form for a permit to exterminate Canada Geese.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160701001250/http://www.dfw.state.or.us/" target="_blank">
http://www.dfw.state.or.us/</a>
will eventually redirect you to:<br>

https://epermits.fws.gov/eRCGR/geSI.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2feRCGR%2fgeSTC.aspx</a><br>
...where you can register to exterminate.<br>
Also see:
<a href="www.fws.gov/forms/3-200-13.pdf" target="_blank">
www.fws.gov/forms/3-200-13.pdf</a>
<p>

Just fill out the form, and pay the small filing fee, and
you can kill all of the Canada Geese that land on your property. And you can raid their nests and break
their eggs and kill their babies. And not just during hunting season &#8212; all year long.
At the end of the year, you fill out another form, saying how many geese you killed and how many
eggs you broke, and send it to Washington DC, and then you can do the same thing again next year.

Here is the USDA page on how to kill Canada Geese:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160701001250/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/downloads/canada_goose.pdf" target="_blank">
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/downloads/canada_goose.pdf</a><br>
(What is really ironic and bizarre about this page is that the very first picture on the page
shows a family of Canada Geese eating bread. You can see the slices of bread on the ground.
So somebody was feeding them while somebody else was talking about killing them.)


<p><li>
Agression? Feeding geese does not cause agression. Canada Goose males are normally
aggressive and dominant, and they have a strict pecking order.
Imagining that feeding the geese makes them aggressive is the logical fallacy of 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">
Assuming A Cause and Effect Relationship</a> where none exists.
<p>
When feeding the geese,
you should always put the food out in many small piles, widely separated, not in one
big pile. If there is only one big pile of food, then the most dominant male will
sit on it and he won't let anyone else have any. Spreading the food around solves
the problem. If the geese are constantly fighting over the food, then it is because
they are starving. The solution is to feed them more.
They become very calm and passive when they get their bellies full.

(The oats are that white spot in the middle foreground.)<br>
The geese don't look very aggressive, do they?<br>

</center>

<p><li>
Excess poop? That is completely untrue, a blatant
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#reversal" target="_blank">Reversal Of Reality</a>.
Bread and grain are concentrated food sources, and the birds eat less of it than
other foods, so it produces less poop. When the birds have to eat a low-calory
low-nutrient diet of grass, algae, and pond scum, that is when they have to eat
large quantities of it to get enough nutrition out of it, and then they produce more poop.

<p><li>
The writer of that sign implies that feeding geese and ducks makes them poop in
the water. Oh? Do the geese and ducks have an outhouse that they will use if they
don't get any bread or grain?  Again, the sign-maker uses the logical fallacy of 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">Assuming A Cause and Effect Relationship</a>
where none exists. The truth is, ducks poop in the water anyway, no matter what
they eat. It's just what they do. The Pope is Catholic, and bears do it in the
woods, and ducks do it in the water. Geese, on the other hand, usually do it on
the grass, which is why some people want to kill them. People complain that the
geese eat the grass in the parks, and then leave the grass littered with goose
droppings. Yes, they do.  On the bright side, goose dropping are relatively
disease-free. It's just shredded grass. Lots of it.

<p><li>
But the crowning glory of this piece of dishonest propaganda is the talk about
bacteria.  The sign-maker declares that bacteria will harm &quot;people, pets,
fish, and water.&quot; That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Fear Mongering and Arguing From Adverse Consequences</a>.
<p>
And the author is also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#lie_omission" target="_blank">Lying By Omission</a>.
What they aren't saying here is that the water in the ponds is sewage water. These
ponds are located right next door to the city sewage treatment plant, and gigantic
pipes carry the waste water right into the ponds. The ponds are incredibly polluted,
and contain every bacterium and disease known to Forest Grove. Sooner or later,
all diseases in the city get flushed down the toilet. Tens of thousands of humans
have already pooped in that water. The water is already loaded with bacteria, and
also phosphates, and it suffers from bad algae blooms in the summer. It is amazing
that the wild creatures are not made sick by the water. They must really have
tough constitutions.
<p>
Signs all over the place declare that the water is polluted, and you can't drink
it, or swim in it, or fish, or even touch it. But this deceptive sign would have
you believe that a few geese and ducks pooping in the water will suddenly cause
bacterial growth, and that would be a bad thing.

</center>
<p>
So the sign-maker is again 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Argueing from Adverse Consequences</a>,
and saying that the fish and pets (what pets?) and people and water will be harmed
by some goose and duck droppings, as if those things are not harmed by the feces
of 25,000 people.

<p>
Failure to mention that the ponds are already overloaded with bacteria from sewage is 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#lie_omission" target="_blank">Lying By Omission</a>.

<p>
This would be some kind of a joke if the lives of some wildlife weren't on the line.
These are the little guys who aren't supposed to get any bread:

</center>

<p>
So what kind of a demented mind makes up such lies and wants to deny hungry animals food?
I call them &quot;Nature Nazis&quot;.
They believe that making life difficult for wildlife is
good for them, and &quot;makes them tough&quot;. Just like military boot camp.
And the animals must be &quot;pure&quot; wildlife, uncontaminated by contact with other races, or
bad (human) influences. Sound familiar?
<p>
Nature Nazis are people who long for a world where the Indians ride horses
bareback across the Great Plains, chasing the herds of buffalo and shooting them with bows
and arrows. And gigantic flocks of Passenger Pigeons darken the sky.
And the impenetrable forest stretches from coast to coast. And the wild geese live
out there in the wilderness and never have any contact with humans.
<p>
But that dream world disappeared more than a century ago. Now, the Indians live on reservations and
drive pickup trucks. And if they have any buffalo, they herd them around the reservation.
The Passenger Pigeons are extinct. There is no more wilderness. It's all farms and cities and paved 
streets and parking lots. And the wild geese live in city parks now, and beg the
visitors for some munchies.

<p>
But Nature Nazis resent any friendship between people and &quot;wildlife&quot;. They want the wildlife to
be totally wild and have no contact with humans. But that is delusional. That is grossly unrealistic.
That isn't the way that the world is now.

So they are guilty of appealing to a 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#glittering_generality" target="_blank">Glittering Generality</a>,
declaring that some idealized Norman-Rockwell world
will exist if we just don't feed the hungry animals.
<p>
The reality is that now even supposedly wild
Cackling Geese from Alaska winter over in Waterfront Park in downtown Portland, Oregon, and somehow,
they have become quite fearless and accustomed to people and cars.

<p>
So do they deserve to die for that? Do they deserve to starve?

As far as cats go, I just have Alley and Titania. Claws would make a
great nickname for Titania, though. Her affection can be quite
painful. And Alley already has the nickname Loudmouth. Why? Well, this
isn't Alley, but it sounds exactly like Alley:<br>

Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again.
</font>
<p>
Anyhow, after a miserable week, I do feel much better. I think it was
the flux that was responsible. Zinc oxide is the most common culprit
for metal fume fever (don't weld galvanized steel). Most fluxes contain
zinc chloride. Burning zinc chloride probably produces zinc oxide.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'm glad to hear that you are recovering.
<p>
Yes, the thing about zinc chloride sounds about right. I also notice that when I
use acid-core solder, that the fumes from the flux are really toxic. I avoid
inhaling that stuff, and I don't use it much anyway. I almost always use
rosin-core solder, unless I'm soldering something like steel that rosin just won't
work on.

</font>
<p>
As for the milk, that seems to be a folk cure. Not sure how well it
actually works, but I'll take any excuse to drink chocolate milk.

<p>
<font color="blue">
:-)
</font>
<p>
I'm guessing you avoided it because you probably worked in a
better-ventilated area than I did (I do my soldering in my dad's
one-bedroom apartment). And you might have used zinc-free flux.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I think mainly it's just that I almost always use rosin-core solder. I've inhaled
a ton of the fumes of that, but it just isn't so toxic. Not like the fumes of
acid-core solder.
</font>

Poor Gus, having to be without his wife for the winter. Cross-species
(sub-species?) relationships can be tough that way. Interesting that
two related species can breed just fine, but two dogs of the same
species, specifically a chihuahua and a great dane, can't really breed
at all. The definition of species is rather muddy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, the definition of species is <i>very</i> muddled. I'm not sure if domestic
geese are really a separate species. The definition of &quot;species&quot; that
my biology professor taught was &quot;a reproductively isolated population.&quot;
Thus, if two different-looking populations can cross-breed, then they are the
same species. They are just two varieties of the same species. Now I know that
blows away a lot of species definitions. In aquaria, Guppies and Mollies can
cross-breed, and the young are fertile. So can Swordtails and Platys. And the
neat movie &quot;The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill&quot; described how San
Francisco was hosting a new hybrid parrot. There are two species of parrots in
South America whose territories are separated by hundreds of miles, so the parrots
never meet in South America, but they met in San Francisco and produced babies of
a variety that never existed before. And the offspring are fertile and continue
to reproduce, so it's like a permanent new variety.

<p>
Domestic geese don't seem to be very far removed from the wild populations. Not
only can Greylag Geese cross with Canada Geese, but so can the pure white domestic
geese. There used to be a big honking male white domestic goose living at
Waterfront Park, and he had a habit of jumping on a female Canada Goose
and producing hybrid offspring. (I guess she must have been a cute French Canadian
goose.) I called him Jefferson, after our white President Thomas Jefferson who
couldn't stay out of his black slave Sally Hemmings' bed, and who produced lots
of crossbreed children himself.)
<p>
Well anyway, his sons also produced fertile offspring, and it went on for about
four generations before they died out.  Apparently, adding white genes to Canada
Geese didn't help them any. The pure Canada Geese were better suited for survival
in the wild.  Mother Nature knows what she is doing, and worked things out long ago.
<p>
We shall have to see what happens with Gus' descendents. 
</font>
<p>
Incidentally, the AA &quot;no cross-talk&quot; thing isn't how group therapy
works at all, in my experience. When I had group in the mental
hospital, we could respond to each other, and there was a therapist
overseeing. Admittedly, I don't know how group therapy works outside
of hospitals, since I've never done it outside of the hospital. Group
really isn't my thing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes. Now that I think about it, that is how my &quot;group therapy&quot; group
was too. Only A.A. forbids &quot;cross-talk&quot;.
<p>
My experience with &quot;group&quot; wasn't very positive either, because it
wasn't really &quot;group&quot;.  More like the leader &quot;counselor&quot;
talking to people, and questioning people, and leading the discussion where he
wanted it to go. We rarely really talked to each other, and we could never talk
freely. He had to always get in there with the &quot;correct&quot; viewpoint.
<p>
Of course, that was the so-called &quot;counselor&quot; who was really a
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">coke-snorting child rapist</a>.
</font>
<p>
Also, I've never seen or heard of Celebrity Rehab, but between looking
at your site and reading Wikipedia, Dr. Drew sounds like a massive
creep. I'll stick with my regular shrink, thanks. As far as I know, he
hasn't killed anybody.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I've never seen Celebrity Rehab either, because I don't get cable. (I've thought
about it, but paying $100 per month to get more channels of commercials is insane.)
But I've gotten lots of letters complaining about Celebrity Rehab, and describing it.
And yes, Dr. Drew sounds like a creep who exploits other people's suffering, and
does not help them.
<p>
And can you say &quot;conflict of interest&quot;? Dr. Drew has a massive conflict
of interest. Is he doing things for the good of the patients, or for the good of
his show's ratings?

</font>
<p>
And despite (because?) Mike Starr's appearance on that show, the
remaining members of the original Alice in Chains are not fans at all:<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I have to agree with them. Exploiting people when they are at their lowest is heartless and despicable.
Years ago, I made a joke about having a <i>Survivor</i> TV series that was based on people
drinking themselves to death on an island (<a href="orange-jokes.html#Survivor" target="_blank">here</a>).
But that was just a sick joke. I didn't think somebody would be low enough to do it for real.
<p>
Oddly enough though, somebody wrote to me and said that my joke blew him away because he was thinking
of doing it for real (<a href="orange-letters20.html#Survivor" target="_blank">here</a>).

And these are the same guys who watched Layne Staley slowly kill
