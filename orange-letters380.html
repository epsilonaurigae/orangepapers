Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
Hi,  thank you for your website.  I have been sober for about eight months and I am
going through a crisis.  My psychologist whom I am seeing in secret as my former
sponsor did not believe in them recommended I go to crisis treatment last week &#8212; I
had been encouraged to stop taking my anti-depressants back in September by my AA
group who does not consider it proper sobriety if one needs them.  I went to the
crisis center and called my sponsor who promptly told me I should leave, that i was
a silly girl whose problems were all of my own making and if I would only stop being
so selfish and arrogant and stop living by my ego i would get better. I am having a
crisis of faith and it is arrogant of me to question god, if I believe hard enough
and make myslef of service rather than whining I will get better.  i was passively
suicidal at this point. I got so confused and distressed that i checked myself out
but my gut told me this was wrong.  I started looking on the internet as for some
reason i seem to have lost all ability to think for myself.  I found your website
and its like everything became clear,  why I haven't been able to force myself to
believe or work the steps adequately enough to feel relief.  I have done everything
that they ask and yet I'm not feeling better.  I saw this as a defect of mine &#8212; I
was trying hard enough, I didn't believe hard enough, it has been driving me slowly
over the edge, but now I'm starting to think that it wasn't me that was the whole
problem but the dogma I have been trying to force myself into that doesn't fit my
anti-religious, questioning and thinking mindset.  I'm now stuck, without AA I don't
have friends or a support structure but I don't think i can keep going now I have
read what you wrote and now I see the blatant issues in the program.  Anyway I just
wanted to say thanks, I hope I can find a way out.<br>

Hello Michela,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about the suffering that you are going through.

<p>
You are quite right in seeing through the racket that the A.A. members were running on you.
Telling you not to take your medications is reprehensible. They are not doctors, and they 
are not licensed to prescribe or proscribe medications. They are practicing medicine without a 
license, and they do not know what they are doing. They didn't go to medical school.
 Those dogmatic fools have killed a lot of people that way.

<p>
You are not defective. The 12 Steps just do not work.  The crazy Steppers who tell you that they
do are just parrotting the slogans of a cult religion.
<p>
And their insistence that you must believe is just standard cult religion. All of the cults say that you
must believe, and if you don't believe what they say, then you are defective and egotistical and evil and
unspiritual and selfish, ... and on and on.
It's a very old racket. (The book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#ancient_cults" target="_blank"><i>The False Messiahs</i> by Jack Gratus</a>
lists cults from 307 BC to 1921. It's a <i>very</i> old racket.)

<p>
I do hope, and I do think, that you can find another group of friends and &quot;support structure&quot;.
For starters, look at this list. Many of these organizations have meetings in a lot of cities,
and most of them have online forums:
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>
<p>
And do not forget that you have a doctor or counselor who cares about you. Don't ignore him or her.
<p>
Also, consider finding a group of friends who have nothing to do with &quot;recovery&quot;.
It could be political, or social, or athletic, or a photography club, or a birdwatching club.
Or maybe a yoga class or rock climbing or Outward Bound,
or anything that promotes physical health and values it more than getting drunk.
It could be anything. A.A. spreads the myth that you must spend the rest of your life in
a &quot;recovery organization&quot;, but that just isn't true.

<p>
Here are some other letters where we were talking about what to do with your life after
quitting A.A.:

<p>
<ul>

<p><li> 
<a href="orange-letters15.html#social_circle" target="_blank">
The single biggest problem I foresee is loneliness. Do you already have a clean

<p>
I agree on not censoring on the OPF. It is a matter of learning to be
mindful of what you say yourself. In the rooms a lot of the time someone
says something offensive or abusive and you do not even realize it is
happening. Disbelief you may call it. But it is the conditioning and that
you are there to get help that throws you off. Still a little voice in your
head is saying, 'is this guy for real.' Sooner or later, you just leave. My
experience is that around seven years a lot of people, that stuck around,
stop going. It is the self censorship that wears you down. And if you speak
up, you find yourself not welcome real quick. That is why the OPF is good
for all of us unwelcome guest.

<p>
Joe and Charlie Big Book Study

<p>
From Bill T

<p>
Have you looked into Joe and Charlie Big Book Study? There is a mp3 of a
1998 talk by the on the internet, easy to find. They did weekend talks all
over the country for many years. Real good pitch for AA, went through the
first 164 pages. They would start Friday night and then go all day Saturday
and Sunday. They did not take any money but all their expenses were paid.
It was like a Greatful Dead concert, all these people would tape it and
then make copies to sell. I think that is why you only can download the
1998 one, any others you have to buy. It does not matter, they were all the
same.

<p>
The reason that I bring this up is that I was given a set of their tapes in
1990. I had been sober 5 years going to AA and still could not figure out
what the hell the steps were about. I went to Step meetings, Big Book
meetings and asked people to explain it, to no avail. They would just say,
'it's in the Book.' I mean, for crying out load, I just did not get it. So
listened to the tapes and I got it. They laid it all out. So then finally I
was able to do the sacred 4th and 5th steps. So I got it, I had arrived and
I could now have the so-called spiritual experience, whoop-t-do, turned out
more like a bad trip. So what it boiled down to was that Joe and Charlie
were my sponsor. They sold me on the big book and the 12 steps of aa. They
were two smooth operators. A short time after that, their little dog and
pony show was in my town and I went, a real scene, a big room full of true
believers. Now I had the pitch and could sell it to others. But that was
not to be. It did not take long for me to see that it had no value, so why
would I try to sell it to someone.

<p>
I gradually stopped going to aa meetings. A lot of the crazy shit was still
in my head. It took many years to clear all that garbage out. I went back
to aa a few years ago and it had changed some. Not as many people at
meetings. It was a mix of some old timers that I knew from before and a lot
of short timers. Many from rehabs and court ordered. Lots that wanted to,
'take you through the big book.' And tell you how to stay sober. Sorry,
been there, done that and I know how to stay sober, you don't drink and if
you do, you don't drink too much. But that would be to easy and you can't
sell books and a program with that. Also, I would hear people say, I have a
home group, a sponsor and am working the steppes when they spoke. Sometimes
they would say that their sponsor has a sponsor. Or even talk of grand
sponsors. Is that a little Pacific group and Mid-town group influence? All
very spooky. I did not bother to read any of the 'approved' literature. I
did search out for the real poop on this business and found the OP among
other helpful sources. After a bit, I stopped going. They way it is set up
you can't get through to anyone and really help them by showing them the
the truth. They are convinced, there is a bunch of us on the OPF that are
painfully aware of  how difficult it is to bring around someone that is
convinced that they have the answer. Oh well.

<p>
So I was wondering if you have thought about writing up anything on Joe and
Charlie? It all sounded good to me years ago, but when I got the truth
about aa from you and others, then I saw it for what it was. Joe McQ
started a rehab, so he was not really doing it for nothing. A link to that
and one to the FIx on them.

Hello Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the experiences. And I thank you very much for your moral decision
not to sell the 12-Step hoax to others. That's good.
<p>
Yes, I've thought of writing something about Joe and Charlie, and also about
<a href="orange-letters317.html#subcults" target="_blank">the other sub-cults</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters25.html#subsects" target="_blank">sub-gurus of A.A.</a>
<p>
So far, I've only gotten around to the sexual predators' sub-cults like those of
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html" target="_blank">Mike Quinones</a> and
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy Imusland</a>.
<p>
I know that Joe and Charlie are some hard-core dogmatic A.A. fundamentalists
with a theology and a following of their own.
Alas, I have to do more research before I write up a page on them, and I need to get a Round Tuit.
<p>
I've downloaded several Joe and Charlie videos, and I think I also have
some tapes of theirs that somebody gave me, but I never got around to listening
to all of them and studying them thoroughly, which I need to do before I'm ready to write a web page.
That is yet another thing on my list of things to do. (It's not like I won't have anything to do in
my old age. :-)

<p>
We discussed Joe and Charlie before,
<p><ul>

<li> <a href="orange-letters113.html#Joe_Charlie" target="_blank">I also urge you to download and just listen to any Joe and Charlie sessions on the A.A. program.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters200.html#" target="_blank">
...listen along to a big book study seminar by a
couple of old drunks called &quot;Joe and Charlie&quot;. They will set you
straight.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters216.html#" target="_blank">
We put AA speakers on a pedestal, 'Joe and Charlie' tapes, Sister Bea, John
Bradshaw, Pia Melody.  I didn't have a life outside the 12 step program...</a>
</ul>

<p>
The whole issue of how cult followers appoint themselves the new preachers and start their own
sub-cults is a fascinating subject in itself. Heck, that's what Bill Wilson did: spawn a child
cult of the Oxford Group and make himself the all-knowing, all-wise guru leader who walked hand in hand
with the Spirit of the Universe on the Broad Highway in the Sky.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now and a Merry Christmas.

These geese are all coming to me to get food. They recognize me, and know that I
am doling out rolled oats for them.  What surprises me is that the whole flock is
familiar with me. The Alaskan Cackling Geese who are afraid of me, who were here
before, are gone, and these larger-bodied Canada Geese who know me are back.
I don't know what they are doing here now. I thought they were all down south.
<p>
(There is one lone Cackling Goose in this picture, a little left of center, and down a bit.
You can see how much smaller the body is. That Cackling Goose is probably one of the three crippled
Cackling Geese who live here year 'round.)
<p>
But I do know that they are hungry. Everything is frozen, and there isn't much to
eat, and they are happy to get some grain in their gullets. I'm glad I brought a
lot, like two big cloth shopping bags full, maybe 20 pounds.
<p>
When you feed them, remember to put the food out in many small piles, not in one
big pile. The most dominant male will try to own the whole supply. If you put the food
in just one big pile, the dominant male will sit on it and try to keep the others
from getting any. But when you put the food in many smaller widely-spaced piles, he can't do
that. Sometimes the dominant male will still try, running from one pile to the next to
chase other geese away from that pile, but then the other geese just move in behind him
and eat the pile that he just abandoned in his rush to the next pile.
He wastes his time running in circles while the other geese eat from the other piles.

The Canada Goose in front is crippled and cannot fly south for the winter. You
can see how the big flying feathers on her wingtip are worn down to bare sticks
from rubbing on the ground. Her wing got broken long ago, and healed crooked,
and now this goose is stuck here for life.  But actually, that's lucky. This is
a good place for a crippled goose to live.
<p>
Perhaps one of the crippled geese will become Gus's new wife next spring.  But
probably not this goose. I think that she is the mate of the big gander in back,
the one with his head up.  He is staying with her through the winter because he
doesn't want to abandon her.  Canada Geese mate for life, and are suprisingly
loyal and faithful to their mates.

<p>
Greetings!

<p>
Been going to your site again and again for research, and have tried
unsuccessfully now for over a year to sign up for the forum. Hoping I can
get someone's attention now.

<p>
About me:

<p>
Forced AA attender (court ordered); I actually chair a weekly AA meeting,
although I can't say anything about God or Higher Powers because I'm
Buddhist and we generally don't pay much attention  to the supernatural,
focusing on the importance of understanding our own minds as a way to
&quot;salvation&quot; (however you define it).

<p>
Besides your fine collection  of articles, I've done a bit of my own
reading on AA. Read Nell Wing's memoirs of her years working for the New
York central organization from 1949 up to at least Bill's death in 1971(?);
she touched briefly on Bill's LSD usage and indicated she had tried it with
Bill and Lois. An really keen on reading Tom Lanagan's and Susan Cheever's
books.

<p>
Anyways, I'd like to participate! I promise to behave myself, but don't
promise to steer clear or controversy or mentioning other, radically
different approaches to dealing with problems related to substance abuse,
and how they differ from the Twelve Step approach.

<p>
Sincerely,

Hello AntKing,
<p>
You are in now. I found your name and approved you.
<p>
And you don't have to avoid controversy and those &quot;outside&quot; subjects.
Please do not practice self-censorship, it's not necessary.
I don't censor people. I believe in freedom of speech.

<p>
And we often discuss other methods of recovery, including CBT and the Sinclair Method. And we
even have a Christian minister who is annoying some people right now.
I go out of my way to avoid censoring people or shutting them down. The only rule I ask for
is that the people please refrain from personal attacks on other people. Please avoid viciousness and
low attacks on others.

<p>
And it sure would be nice if people would stick to telling the truth, but that might be too much
to ask. (At least, of some people.)

<p>
I read Nell Wing's book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Nell_Wing" target="_blank"><i>Grateful to have Been There</i></a>. 
Interesting. Unfortunately, she saw everything through tinted lenses.
Bill Wilson tripped his brain out on LSD for years, while claiming to be sober, and all that she
could say was that Bill was conducting research into sobriety, and it was legal at that time.
But so was alcohol.

Alas, it was a real white-wash. Susan Cheever even made ridiculous statements
like that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever4" target="_blank">Bill Wilson lived in an
age of sexual frustration and had to contend with bundling boards</a>.
And it was okay for Bill Wilson to be a sexual predator, because it's an official secret, and besides,
Bill is special.
And practicing necromancy and talking to dead people in s&eacute;ances is normal and reasonable, isn't it?
Doesn't everybody do it?

To all readers: You should not have to wait a year to get in.
If you have registered, and haven't been approved and enabled within a week,
please do let me know. Email me.
I go on vacation for a few days now and then, but you shouldn't have to
wait more than a week to get in.
<p>
And always do email me as soon as you register, and tell me what user name you registered.
That is to distinguish you from the spammers. The spam-bots (not even real humans) create thousands
of false registrations, attempting to get enabled to post, so that they can spam the web site with
advertisements for their sundry scams and products and rackets and frauds.
The spam-bots won't &#8212; and can't &#8212; email me with anything resembling
a human-written letter, so I just don't enable them, and so far, that's doing a
good job of keeping them out.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

Hello Gary,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Chuck Chamberlain was the sponsor of Clancy Imusland. (He was also the father of the famous
actor Richard Chamberlain.) I have one document about
Chuck C., his testimony before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters178.html#Kathy_F" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters178.html#Kathy_F</a><br>
and<br>
<a href="orange-chuckc1969.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-chuckc1969.html</a>

<p>
You can see from this document that Chuck C. was just spouting all of the standard
A.A. platitudes and slogans. There is not an original thought in there anywhere.
And it's also contradictory and false cult dogma. And notice how he ended his
testimony by recommending that the government force more people into A.A.
(That's promotion, not attraction.)
<p>
Now some of the A.A. sub-gurus and self-appointed experts do disagree with each
other, and emphasize different things in their sermons.  I know of the divisions
in A.A. like Clancy's fascist cult versus more moderate branches of A.A.
The fact remains that none of them has gotten a good success rate in sobering
up alcoholics. The A.A. program just doesn't work. And they all still use the
same 12 Steps, and they all make absurd claims like that an invisible &quot;higher
power&quot; who can be anything that you want to
believe in will fix your insane mind and remove your defects of character and
your moral shortcomings for you.  It's all still irrational faith healing that
has a proven track record of failure.

<p> 
Oh well, have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	Cracked magazine<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I was writing to (maybe?) help clear up
<a href="orange-letters378.html#Ray_S" target="_blank">some confusion in a recent letter</a> regarding
Cracked.com. Your memory serves you right, it's the digital continuation of the
other Mad magazine.

<p>
The website is split pretty evenly between satirical and informative articles. Many
of the latter at least give their sources to allow the reader to determine the
veracity of the claims for themselves. I sometimes find them wanting, but I'd go as
far to say a person would be better off trusting Cracked than the History channel.

<p>
Although, that's not saying much at this point, I suppose. Anyway, just wanted to
let ya know that you were correct about what Cracked is, but that it's changed
somewhat over the years. I wouldn't dismiss something simply because it's hosted
there, personally.

<p>
I trust you are well,

<p>
Taylor

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Taylor,
<p>
Thanks for the clarification. Yes, that's what I suspected. Cracked Magazine.
<p>
While I find their web site entertaining, it seems like a dangerous format: What are you
supposed to believe? How do you know for sure whether you should take something seriously
or laugh at it?
<p>
With a web site like that, the joke might be on the reader who gets fooled and confuses
fact with fiction.
<p>
Have a good day now and a Merry Christmas.

Cackling Geese

These three Cackling Geese are crippled, and cannot fly away, so they are permanent residents.
You can see how the wing of the one on the left is wrecked.
They are not exactly tame, but not exactly terrified of me either.
They are not fleeing from me in fright. Quite the opposite. They came near me to get food, but
they are not comfortable with getting too close. So they are trying to work their way around
me to get to a pile of rolled oats.

A bully drove him away from the pile he was eating at, so he wants me to put out another pile for
him. So I did.

Gus and the bully
</center>
Here the bully comes again, from the right, wanting to take over this pile of oats.
Gus is actually bigger than the bully, but he isn't much into fighting.
So I'll just give Gus another pile further on.
In the mean time, other geese are eating the piles that the bully just left behind
as he rushed to this pile of oats.
The bully doesn't really gain anything by running from pile to pile, trying to hog all of the oats.

Subject: Report from Jim Battle<br>

Hello Everyone,

<p>
Below you will find a link to a forum called The Orange Papers Forum. I am
a member. Since the time I joined, 6 weeks ago, the Orange Papers website
went from four million hits to six million hits in just one month. That's
an incredible increase in hits. I and others believe that this is largely
due to the conflict between me and certain members.

<p>
Here is the Orange Papers link<br>
&lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005232/http://orange-papers.info/forum" target="_blank">
http://orange-papers.info/forum</a>&gt;

<p>
You see, I joined this forum because the members are just as much against
AA as I am. However, a small (but very vocal) group of members, who are
highly-respected by many other members, hate me because I'm a Christian
preacher who is testifying that the Lord helps people overcome addictions.

<p>
The owner of this website and forum calls himself Orange. And although he's
not a Christian, he has no problem with me presenting my Christian views on
his forum. He believes very much in freedom of speech.

<p>
Nevertheless, this band of wicked members don't want me to tell the truth
about Christianity, The Bible, and Jesus Christ because they have been
deceiving other members about these subjects for years. They are furious
because I am exposing their anti-theist agenda on a forum that is only
supposed to be anti-AA.

<p>
Anti-theists are atheists who openly fight against all religion, especially
Christianity. A couple of members who claim to be Christians have joined
these members in viciously attacking me in blogs and comments they post.
The reason I am spending so much time defending Christianity and The Bible
on this forum is because there are many people reading these blogs and
comments but are not saying anything. I believe that the Lord is using my
blogs and comments to bring more people to this forum and to encourage His
people who are reading them. Here is a link to my blog Jim Battle's Blog<br>

<p>
The link above takes you directly to all of MY blogs but this link will
take you to ALL of the blogs. The Blogs of My
Enemies<br>


<p>
By reading the titles of the blogs they have posted lately, you will see
how much these few bullying members are against preachers, Christianity,
The Bible, and Jesus. If you open up my blogs or theirs, and scroll down
the page, you can recognize my comments to them by the little logo next to
them (an red, orange, and yellow little book titled &quot;12 Steps To
Destruction&quot;).

<p>
If for you ever decide to join this forum (to make comments) it would NOT
be wise to let them know that you know me. If you ever decide to join write
me and I'll explain why.

<p>
Also, here are the link to my TV program videos:

Hello again, Jim,
<p>
Thanks for the links for the videos. That is good.
<p>
I don't think that all of the people on the forum are against Christianity. It's more like
they are opposed to attacks on gay guys, or atheists. Or that atheists hate Christians because
Christians have absolute moral standards.
That starts an argument real quick.
<p>
Speaking of the statement that Christian believers had absolute moral standards,
 I saw that post in the forum, and wrote up a response
to the claim, which I'll add onto the bottom of this list of letters.
<p>
I doubt that the sudden increase in web site traffic is just due to controversies and arguments
in the forum.  I know that there has been a lot of debate, and some posts get 50 or 70 comments.
Still, 50 or 70 isn't 2 million.

<p>
It is normal for the web traffic to increase in the fall. The usual pattern, year
after year, is for traffic to drop way down during the summer  &#8212;
 the &quot;Summer Slump&quot;.  People are out playing in the sunshine, swimming
and vacationing, and don't want to be indoors in front of a hot computer.
<p>
But then, when the weather turns bad, they all come indoors and cruise the Internet.
 The traffic slowly, steadily, ramps up until it peaks in March of the following
Spring, except for a small dip in December, a small Christmas slump where people
are busy doing Christmas things and partying instead of reading my web site. But
then, come January, after they have had their Christmas and New Years blow-outs,
they are back to it, and stay at it until March, after which the next Summer Slump begins.

<p>
Beyond that, the overall trend line, year after year, is a slow steady increase. That has been going on
for 12 years now.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject: Religious People Are Less Intelligent Than Atheists

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
I thought you might be interested in a blog post titled &quot;Being Religious or
Spiritual Is Linked With Getting More Depressed&quot;:<br>

<p>
On this blog, one member called lamnotastatistic posted a link to a study that showed that
&quot;religious people are less intelligent than atheist&quot;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005232/http://news.yahoo.com/religious-people-are-less-intelligent-than-atheists--study-finds--113350723.html" target="_blank">
http://news.yahoo.com/religious-people-are-less-intelligent-than-atheists--study-finds--113350723.html</a>

<p>
Not one OPF member complained about this great insult to people who believe
in God. However, those who have been complaining about me would have been
writing you letters and doing all they could to get me banned if I had
posted a link to a study that proved that atheists are less intelligent
than religious people.

<p>
What if a new member who believes in God reads something like this? And
they've accused me of &quot;religious abuse&quot; and &quot;spiritual abuse&quot; but said
nothing about this. Just letting you know about the double-standard of
those who want me banned.

<p>
Take Care,<br>
Jim Battle

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jim,
<p>
Ah, but is it an insult to say that religious people get depressed more?
Or that non-believers are more intelligent?  I remember a saying that someone said
to me a long, long time ago: &quot;A wise man cannot be insulted because, the truth
is not an insult, and a lie is not worth noticing.&quot;
<p>
The big question for me is, &quot;Is it true?&quot; Was the poll or study or survey or test
done in a fair and balanced and reasonable and accurate manner?  What standards were
used for judging depression?  How depressed?
What methods, and what standards, were used to measure intelligence?
How was the testing done?

<p>
All of the time that I was growing up, the standard opinion was that atheists were very
depressed people because they could not look forwards to going to Heaven. All that they could
expect was old age, sickness, death, darkness and oblivion. That's enough to drive someone to
suicide, and some depressed atheists did choose the suicide exit.

<p>
The thing is, nobody said that it was insulting to the atheists to tell them that they were more
depressed than the believers. Or that their lives were glum and miserable because they had nothing
to believe in.

<p>
So what reason do we have now to think that it is actually the believers who
get more depressed? The first thing that occurs to me is the extremely
judgemental nature of so much of Christianity:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> You are born guilty of the Original Sin.
<li> You are defective and imperfect, and you displease God.
<li> You are not what God wants you to be (even though God made you what you are).
<li> You sin constantly.
<li> You are just a disgusting sinner.  
</ul>

<p>
Yes, I would find that very, very depressing if I believed it. Fortunately for me, I don't.

<p>
Unfortunately, some people do believe that stuff, and they find those beliefs so depressing
that they commit suicide over them.

Subject: Orange agrees Jim Battle is a dangerous criminal
<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
I just thought you should know that you are being lied about on the forum.
Brett posted &quot;Orange's agrees that Jim Battle is a dangerous criminal&quot;.
This is slander and he's making it seem like you are the one doing the
slandering. I will have a hard time convincing any churches that our
anti-AA cause is good if they think that you believe I'm a dangerous
criminal. They will know that this is slander and will falsely believe that
you are guilty of it. So you might want to put Brett in check. Thanks.

<p>
Jim Battle
<p>
P.S.: Orange, what I quoted was in the title of Brett's blog.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Jim,
<p>
Quite right. I never said any such thing. I wish people would refrain from putting words
into my mouth.
<p>
There is a world of difference between someone who believes in Christianity  &#8212;  even if in a Fundamentalist
way  &#8212;  and a dangerous criminal.
<p>
Have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas.
