<hr width="100%">
<br>Dated :&nbsp; August 11, 1983

<p>I, LOIS BURNHAM WILSON, residing in Bedford Hills, County of Westchester,
State of New York, being of sound and disposing mind and memory, do hereby
make, publish and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby
revoking all former wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made.

<p><b>FIRST:</b>
<ul>A.&nbsp; I give and bequeath all of the jewelry, clothing and personal
effects I may own at my death to NELL WING, if she survives me.</ul>

<ul>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; give and bequeath all of the other tangible
personal property I may own at my death, including without limitation,
books, memorabilia, furniture and furnishings, to THE STEPPING STONES FOUNDATION,

<b>SECOND:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give and bequeath $75,000 to HARRIET
SEVERINO, if she survives me.

<p><b>THIRD:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, at my death, I am the owner of my

<p><b>FOURTH:</b>
A. Under the Last Will and Testament of my husband, WILLIAM GRIFFITH
WILSON, I have the right to designate beneficiaries who shall be entitled
to receive, in such proportions as I may designate, interests after my
death in certain of the royalties payable after the death of my said husband
under an agreement dated April 29, 1963, between my husband and Alcoholics
Anonymous World Services, Inc. (&quot;A.A.W.S.&quot;), of 468 Park Avenue South,
New York, New York, as amended by an agreement between myself and A.A.W.S.&nbsp;
I hereby direct that all of the right, title or interest I may have in
or to such royalties shall be disposed of as follows:

<ul>
<ul>&nbsp;1.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in four percent
of such royalties to DR. LEONARD STRONG, who is the husband of my sister-in-law,
DOROTHY STRONG, or if he does not survive me, to his children, MURIEL STRONG
MORLEY and LEONARD V. STRONG III, if both of them survive me or to the
survivor if only one of them survives me.
<br>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in six percent of
such royalties to my sister-in-law, DOROTHY STRONG, if she survives me,
or if she does not survive me, to her children, MURIAL STRONG MORLEY and
LEONARD V. STRONG III, if both of them survive me or to the survivor if
only one of them survives me.
<br>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in four percent
of such royalties to MURIEL STRONG MORLEY, if she survives me.
<br>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in four percent
of such royalties to LEONARD V. STRONG III, if he survives me.
<br>&nbsp;5.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in four percent
of such royalties to my sister-in-law, LAURA BURNHAM, if she survives me.
<br>&nbsp;6.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in four percent
of such royalties to my sister-in-law, FLORENCE BURNHAM, if she survives
me.
<br>&nbsp;7.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in ten percent of
such royalties to NELL WING, if she survives me.
<br>&nbsp;8.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in one percent of
such royalties to my cousin, CAROL LOU BURNHAM, if she survives me.
<br>&nbsp;9.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in three percent
of such royalties to my cousin, ANN BURNHAM SMITH, if she survives me.
<br>10.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two percent of such
royalties to my cousin, ANN WALKER, if she survives me.
<br>11.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two percent of such
royalties to my cousin, DIXON WALKER, if he survives me.
<br>12.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two percent of such
royalties to my cousin, KATE KNAP, if she survives me.
<br>13.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two percent of such
royalties to my husband's cousin, JEAN KALKOFF, if she survives me.
<br>14.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two percent of such
royalties to my husband's cousin, BARBARA PALAZZARI, if she survives me.
<br>15.&nbsp; I give and bequeath an interest in fifty percent of such
royalties to THE STEPPING STONES FOUNDATION, a New York not-for-profit
corporation (&quot;STEPPING STONES&quot;) for a period lasting until the later of:
<ul>(a) August 31, 1997, or
<br>(b) that date which is ten years after the date of my death.</ul>
</ul>
B.&nbsp; If any beneficiary named in subparagraphs &quot;1&quot; through &quot;14&quot; of
Paragraph &quot;A&quot; does not survive me and if there is no effective alternate
provision for the portion of the royalties which would have been payable
to such beneficiary had he or she survived me, then I give and bequeath
such deceased beneficiary's portion of the royalties to STEPPING STONES
for the period determined pursuant to subparagraph &quot;15&quot; of Paragraph &quot;A&quot;
of this Article.</ul>
<b>FIFTH:</b>
<ul>A.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath all of the rest, residue and remainder
of my estate, whether real, personal or mixed, of whatsoever kind and nature
and wheresoever situate of which I may die seized or possessed or in which
I may have any interest or over which I may have any power of disposition,
such residue of my estate herein sometimes referred to as my &quot;residuary
estate&quot;, to my Trustees under a Trust Agreement dated August 11, 1983,
between LOIS B. WILSON, as Grantor, and <michael alexander and owen j. flanagan, as trustees, to be added to and commingled with the trust property of that trust and distributed as if it had been a part thereof immediately before my death in accordance with the provisions of that trust agreement and any amendments made to it pursuant to its terms before my death (the trust agreement and any such amendments thereto herein sometimes together referred to as the &quot;trust agreement&quot;). <p>B.&nbsp; If for any reason the Trust Agreement is not in effect at my
death, I give, devise and bequeath any residuary estate to the following
persons in the following proportions:
<ul>1.&nbsp; Eight percent to DR. LEONARD STRONG, who is the husband of
my sister-in-law, DOROTHY STRONG, or if she does not survive me, to his
children, MURIEL STRONG MORLEY and LEONARD V. STRONG III, if both of them
survive me or to the survivor of them if only one of them survives me.
<br>2.&nbsp; Twelve percent to my sister-in-law, DOROTHY STRONG, or if
she does not survive me, to her children, MURIEL STRONG MORLEY and LEONARD
V. STRONG III, if both of them survive me or to the survivor of them if
only one of them survives me.
<br>3.&nbsp; Eight percent to MURIEL STRONG MORLEY, if she survives me.
<br>4.&nbsp; Eight percent to LEONARD V. STRONG III, if he survives me.
<br>5.&nbsp; Eight percent to my sister-in-law, LAURA BURNHAM, if she survives
me.
<br>6.&nbsp; Eight percent to my sister-in-law, FLORENCE BURNHAM, if she
survives me.
<br>7.&nbsp; Twenty percent to NELL WING, if she survives me.
<br>8.&nbsp; Two percent to my cousin, CAROL LOU BURNHAM, if she survives
me.
<br>9.&nbsp; Six percent to my cousin, ANN BURNHAM SMITH, if she survives
me.
<br>10.&nbsp; Four percent to my cousin, ANN WALKER, if she survives me.
<br>11.&nbsp; Four percent to my cousin, DIXON WALKER, if he survives me.
<br>12.&nbsp; Four percent to my cousin, KATE KNAP, if she survives me.
<br>13.&nbsp; Four percent to my husband's cousin, JEAN KALKOFF, if she
survives me.
<br>14.&nbsp; Four percent to my husband's cousin, BARBARA PALAZZARI, if
she survives me.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
C.&nbsp; If my residuary estate becomes distributable under Paragraph &quot;B&quot;
hereof and if any person named as a beneficiary under Paragraph &quot;B&quot; hereof
does not survive me and if there is no effective alternate provision in
Paragraph &quot;B&quot; hereof for the portion of the residuary estate which would
have been payable to such beneficiary had he or she survived me, then I
direct that the portion of my residuary estate which would have been payable
to such deceased beneficiary shall be divided among the remaining beneficiaries
under Paragraph &quot;B&quot; hereof ratably, in the proportion that each of their
interests in my residuary estate bears to the aggregate of the interests
of all remaining beneficiaries in my residuary estate.</ul>
<b>SIXTH:&nbsp;</b>
<ul>A.&nbsp; I direct that all estate, inheritance and other death taxes
payable by reason of my death to the United States of America or any state
or other government or otherwise or any foreign government or subdivision
thereof and all interest and penalties thereon (herein together &quot;my estate
taxes&quot;) shall be paid as expenses of administration out of my residuary
estate, without apportionment against any beneficiary either within or
without my residuary estate and regardless of whether such property passes
under this Will or otherwise.&nbsp; Under the Trust Agreement, I directed
the Trustees to pay over to my Executors such amounts from the trust fund
held under the Trust Agreement (herein sometimes the &quot;Trust Fund&quot;) as my
Executors shall request from time to time in writing for the payment or
discharge of my debts, my funeral expenses, the expenses of administering
my estate and my estate taxes.&nbsp; If my residuary estate and the Trust
Fund are not sufficient to pay my debts, my funeral expenses, the expenses
(including commissions) of administering my estate and my estate taxes,
I direct that such debts and expenses shall be paid out of my residuary
estate and the Trust Fund before any payment is made on account of my estate
taxes.&nbsp; If, and to the extent, that my residuary estate and the Trust
Fund are not sufficient to pay all of my estate taxes, I direct that the
balance of my estate taxes be paid out of the royalties paid to the individuals
named in subparagraphs 1 through 14 of Paragraph &quot;A&quot; of Article &quot;FOURTH&quot;
of this Will, and charged pro rata to each beneficiary named in said subparagraphs
1 through 14 in the same proportion that his or her percentage of such
royalties stated in Article &quot;FOURTH&quot; bears to the sum of the percentages
of all such royalties then being paid pursuant to Article &quot;FOURTH&quot; to beneficiaries
other than STEPPING STONES.

<p>B.&nbsp; I specifically authorize my Executors to request A.A.W.S. to
pay to my Executors on behalf of any beneficiary of royalties named in
Article &quot;FOURTH&quot; (other than STEPPING STONES) so much of such royalties
as my Executors determine is necessary for the payment of my estate taxes
pursuant to Paragraph &quot;A&quot; of this Article.&nbsp; I specifically ask A.A.W.S.
to comply with any such request by my Executors.&nbsp; Any amounts paid
by A.A.W.S. to my Executors under this paragraph shall be credited against
the total amount of royalties payable by A.A.W.S.

<p>C.&nbsp; If there is any dispute as to the time or manner of payment
of any of my estate taxes or as to the share of my estate taxes to be borne
by any beneficiary or by the share of royalties passing to any beneficiary,
I appoint my Executors arbitrators of any such dispute and direct that
their decision shall be binding and conclusive on all persons beneficially
interested in my estate or in any property passing under this Will.</ul>
<b>SEVENTH:</b>&nbsp; If any person named herein as devisee, legate or
beneficiary and I should die simultaneously or under such circumstances
that it is difficult or impracticable to determine that one of us has survived
the other, or my Executors hereinafter named conclude that they cannot
be reaonably sure that one of us has survived the other, the provisions
herein relating to such person shall be given effect as if I had survived
such person.

<p><b>EIGHTH:</b>
<ul>A.&nbsp; I appoint MICHAEL ALEXANDER, of 460 Park&nbsp; Avenue, New
York, New York, and OWEN J. FLANAGAN, of 60 East 42nd Street, New York,
New York, Executors of this my Last Will and Testament.&nbsp; I appoint
LEONARD H. STEIBEL, of 460 Park Avenue,&nbsp; New York, New York, substitute
or successor Co-Executor to serve if either MICHAEL
ALEXANDER or OWEN J. FLANAGAN fails to qualify or ceases to serve
as my Executor.

<p>B. No bond or other security shall be required of my Executors (or of
any substitute or successor) in New York or in any other jurisdiction.

<p>C.&nbsp; Any reference in this Will to &quot;my Executors&quot; shall mean and
include the Executors then qualified and acting.

<p>D.&nbsp; I direct that my Executors shall receive commissions (computed
at the rates stated in the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act as amended to
the date such commissions are to be paid) on all property passing under
my Will, including without limitation the specifically bequeatherd property
to be distributed under Articles &quot;FIRST&quot;, &quot;THIRD&quot; and &quot;FOURTH&quot; of my Will.&nbsp;
I direct that for the purpose of determining commissions the specifically
bequeathed property shall be valued at the value finally determined in
the Federal estate tax proceedings relating to my estate and that all such
commissions shall be paid out of my residuary estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; If for
any reason my residuary estate is insufficient for the payment of such
commissions, I direct that any deficiency shall be charged ratably to and
paid out of the property on which such commissions are computed in the
proportion that any item of such property bears to the aggregate of all
items of such property.</ul>
<b>NINTH:</b>
<ul>A.&nbsp; My executors shall have full power and authority in their
absolute and uncontrolled discretion to hold and retain any of the property
coming into their hands hereunder in the same form of investment as that
in which it is received to them, although it may not be of the character
of investments permitted by law to executors including, but not limited
to, the right to continue the operation of any business in which I may
be engaged at my death, for so long a period as they in their sole, absolute
and uncontrolled discretion may deem proper.&nbsp; They shall also have
all power and authority, in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion,
to improve, sell or lease for any period although it may extend beyond
the duration of the administration of my estate, but not to exceed twenty-one
years, for any price and with any provisions for renewal or renewals which
they shall deem advisable, or mortgage or exchange the whole or any part
of the property, real or personal, at any time held by them hereunder,
for such price and upon such terms and conditions as may to them seem advisable.

<p>B.&nbsp; My Executors in making investments and reinvestments shall
not be limited to securities of the character permitted for the investment
of trust funds by the laws of the State of New York or any other State,
but instead shall have power in their discretion at any time and from time
to time to invest in, and to purchase and hold for investment, such securities,
including common and preferred stocks and/or any other type or kind of
property, including non-income-producing securities or property and any
so-called wasting investments as they in their absolute and uncontrolled
discretion shall deem advisable, and from time to time to alter and vary
any investment at any time made or held.&nbsp; I specifically authorize
my Executors to hold uninvested any part of my estate or funds for such
time or times as they in their sole and uncontrolled judgment may deem
advisable.&nbsp; I have given my Executors the unusual
power to purchase and hold on-income-producing property and wasting investments
and even to hold funds uninvested because I do not wish to limit them in
their investment or reinvestment of the estate and so possibly prevent
their meeting some contingency which I do not now anticipate.
I desire them to be free to purchase and hold such property as they may,
in their sole and uncontrolled discretion, deem necessary at any
time to protect the corpus of the estate from depletion.

<p>C.&nbsp; No purchaser at any sale made by my Executors shall be bound
to inquire into the expediency, propriety, validity, or necessity of any
sale made by them or to see to or be liable for the application of the
purchase moneys arising therefrom.

<p>D.&nbsp; My Executors shall have the power in their discretion to vote
in person or by proxy all stock held by them; to assent to any action or
non-action, to enter into or consent to any reorganization, lease or sale,
to pay out of any fund administered hereunder to any committee, representative,
agent or depositary, any assessments, expenses, contributions and sums
of money in connection with any securities held by them; to exchange the
securities held by them for other securities issued in connection with
such arrangement and to accept and retain such other securities so received,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; to register any property
in the name of their nominees or in their own names, or to hold property
unregistered or in such other form that title shall pass by delivery, but
without increasing or decreasing their liability as Executors and, generally,
to exercise in respect of all securities held by them all the same rights
and powers as are or may be lawfully exercised by persons owning similar
property in their own right.

<p>E.&nbsp; I give to my Executors, in connection with the administration
of my estate, or in connection with the purchase, management or sale of
any securities or other property held by them as Executors, power to employ
agents, custodians, depositaries, accountants, attorneys, investment counsel
or other advisers, to delegate to them discretionary powers and to compensate
them for their services as an expense of the administration of my estate.

<p>F.&nbsp; I give to my Executors power to insure or otherwise protect
any personal property constituting part of my estate.

<p>G.&nbsp; In making any division or distribution of my estate, my Executors
shall have full power to make such division or distribution in cash or
in kind or partly in cash and partly in kind.

<p>H.&nbsp; No Executor shall, if acting in good faith, incur any personal
liability or responsibility because of any mistake in judgment or any other
act or omission in his fiduciary capacity, or because of any action taken
pursuant to any power or discretion granted under this Will or by law or
because of any mistake, act or omission by a Co-Executor.</ul>

of August, 1983.
