   MEETING BS BINGO
</center>

<p>
 Do you keep falling asleep in meetings? What about
 those long and boring using stories?? Get tired of
 the same old Slogan Babble, or members who continue
 to
 deal with the same problems, same defects, and same
 painful relationships FOR YEARS?

<p>
 Here's a way to change all that...

<p>
 1. Before (or during) your next meeting, prepare
 yourself by drawing a square. I find that 5&quot; x 5&quot; is
 a good size. Divide the card into columns &#8212; five
 across and five down. That will give you 25 one-inch
 blocks.


<p>
 2. Write one of the following 25 words/phrases in
 each block:
<p>
<ol>

<li>  Issues<br>
<li>  Inner-child<br>
<li>  Living Amends<br>
<li>  Meaningful Relationship<br>
<li>  Didn't Mean to Use<br>
<li>  I'm Stuck On Step ____<br>
<li>  Couldn't Find A Meeting<br>
<li>  My Sponsor Has Been Out Of Town<br>
<li>  I Can't change<br>
<li>  I Won't change<br>
<li>  Yeah But<br>
<li>  Oh, The Pain<br>
<li>  But.... don't you think<br>
<li>  Misunderstood<br>
<li>  I'll Never<br>
<li>  Rational Recovery<br>
<li>  Recovering Person<br>
<li>  Searching (as in, &quot;for answers&quot;)<br>
<li>  Gonna (sometimes prefaced with, &quot;I'm&quot;)<br>
<li>  Been thinking (sometimes prefaced with, &quot;I've&quot;)<br>
<li>  She/He said<br>
<li>  Dysfunctional<br>
<li>  I heard<br>
<li>  We Addicts or We Alcoholics<br>
<li>  I don't know much about this, but...<br>
</ol>

<p>
 3. Check off the appropriate block when you hear one
 of the above words or phrases.

<p>
 4. When you get five blocks horizontally, vertically,
 or diagonally, stand up and shout &quot;BULLSHIT!&quot;

<p>

Hi, my name is Mike and I quit alcohol.  Sorry, but I'm not going to give you credit
for my recovery :P  However, I will say you are truly a hero in times when we need
them most.  Telling the truth when the norm is a lie is VERY difficult to do.
<p>
I'll tell you my story with AA.  I couldn't figure out how the damned thing works.
It defied common sense &#8212; not just the powerlessness part, but the whole schmeal.
<p>
So, I quit.
<p>
Liked the coffee, tho :)
<p>
Keep fighting the good fight.

This web site (orange-papers.org) is the single most comprehensive
collection of AA facts I have ever come across.   The information has
substantiated my  long time belief that AA is a cult.  I will respect the
quality of the material presented by following up with a well thought out
note detailing my experience in AA and NA (17 years of cult participation).
My biggest &quot;problem&quot; is an exit strategy as I have built my social  circle
around people in recovery.

<p>

Thanks again,  this information is invaluable.

Hi BB,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
The exit strategy question has popped up before, a few times, especially
the issue of building a new social circle.
Like

and 
<a href="orange-letters19.html#social_circle" target="_blank">here</a>

and 
<a href="orange-letters48.html#social_circle" target="_blank">here</a>
and 
<a href="orange-letters56.html#social_circle" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
For sure, getting yourself a new clean and sober social circle is essential.
I think a lot hangs on that.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

<p>

Your website is very interesting, misleading and ill informed. Although
entertaining I find the reading opinionated and sentimental.

<p>

Your statistics support your views however I am curious if you researched
both sides.

<p>

Cheers

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Richard,
<p>
Yes, I have investigated both sides of the issue, including actually going to a zillion
12-Step meetings and seeing for myself.
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">Check out the bibliography</a>.
It begins with a whole bunch of A.A. council-approved books.
I have tried hard to read all of the council-approved stuff that is available.

<p>
I also have a challenge out there, asking the 12-Step true believers
to send in any valid medical tests that show that A.A. actually works to make alcoholics
quit drinking. I've been asking for some proof of A.A. efficacy for more than 5 years now,
almost 6 years. And all I've gotten is a few references to
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">faked studies</a>.

<p>
I'm still open. Send evidence. Send proof. Send any facts that show that A.A. actually improves
the alcoholics' recovery rate &#8212; better than just going it alone and quitting by yourself.
Send any information that you have to enlighten me and make me better informed,
since you believe that I am &quot;ill informed&quot;.
I'm all ears.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

I believe you, my friend, are obsessive compulsive.

<p>

I have never seen anyone put so much work into tearing something, such as the Big
Book, down.

<p>

Why?

<p>

-Steve..

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Steve,
<p>
You know, there is getting to be an echo in here. Steppers routinely complain that I
am &quot;obsessed&quot; with putting A.A. down, or proving A.A. wrong.
For some examples of that behavior, look:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters7.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters12.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters16.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters17.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters23.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters27.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters34.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters35.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters45.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters54.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters58.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>, and

<li> <a href="orange-letters71.html#obsess" target="_blank">here</a>
</ol>
<p>
If a doctor goes to work at a hospital 5 days a week, is he &quot;obsessed&quot; with fixing people?<br>
If an auto mechanic works 5 days a week at a garage, is he &quot;obsessed&quot; with fixing cars?<br>
If an A.A. member goes to 90 meetings in 90 days, is he &quot;obsessed&quot; with Alcoholics Anonymous?<br>
<p>
Occasionally working on telling the truth about some popular quack medicine and cult religion
is not an &quot;obsession&quot;.
If I goofed off any more, or spent any more time on other
interests, I'd never get anything done on
this web site. As it is, I'm a month behind in answering email, but I'm slowly getting caught up.

<p>
It's been a great summer. Lots of sunshine and I got a good suntan and bought my ticket in
the melanoma lottery.
And had fun with the fuzz-ball goslings. And my guitar playing got better.
<p>
And then I come home to find some A.A. member insisting that I am &quot;obsessed&quot;
with proving Alcoholics Anonymous wrong. It's laughable, really.
<p>
But autumn is here, and the sunshine is disappearing.
The rainy fall and cold winter will leave me stuck indoors, and I'll probably get more done
on the web site then. I might even get caught up on my email.

<p>
Oh, by the way, all of those sneers about my &quot;obsession&quot; do not really change
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">what a failure Alcoholics Anonymous
actually is</a>, now do they? So such
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i></a>
attacks are irrelevant.
<p>
Why do I work on this web site? Here is the usual list of reasons:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction, my introduction to A.A.</a>, and also
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program" target="_blank">the &quot;treatment&quot;
bait-and-switch trick</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing" target="_blank">another friend goes missing</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

What  shall we say ?

What shall we say  when history asks how such crimes came to be committed in

Will we say that we stood silently by,  shrugging our shoulders, filling our bellies, closing our eyes?

Or will we be  able to say: We saw. We dissented. We resisted. We condemned.

For all those who  want to open their eyes to the horrors of the illegal

corruption of the Child  Protective Services. Go, see, open your eyes, and let them

Anyways, I went to AA for 2 1/2 years because I had a problem with
drinking and I thought AA was a place to go for help to stop drinking.
Boy was I wrong about that one.  I do admit at first I bought into
their mumbo jumbo, they got me when I was all vulnerable and didn't
know any better. They were all real nice to me at first, which did
change as time went on.

<p>
So I got a sponsor and stuff, he told me to read big book and I read
it and thought it was absurd. I had a big big problem with the 'We
Agnostics' chapter. I'm an atheist and well that chapter was the
stupidest thing I read about someone trying to get me to believe in
god. Next my sponsor started to work the steps with me, I had a
problem with step one and argued with him about how I am not
powerless, I just keep repeating stupid behaviors over and over. I
kept making the same stupid decisions. He told me I had a disease and
I laughed at him. I told him it was the first disease I have ever
heard of were you can buy over the counter. He didn't like that too
much.
<p>
He basically skipped me on to step 2, this is where problems
started to happen. The higher power or god thing. He told me I had to
believe in god or I would drink and die. I didn't know what having to
believe in god had to do with quitting drinking, according to the
steppers, there is no other way. I also don't believe god exists, so I
asked him if he had any scientific evidence or any solid proof. His
proof was that he was sober, and I told him he was sober because that
was his choice. So, he then asked me to prove that god doesn't exist.
I told him it was not the atheist that had to prove that god does not
exist, it is the theist that has to prove that god exists, since
they're the ones making the claims.
<p>
He got mad, so I gave him an
example to help him understand. I told him, suppose i say that there
are purple unicorns, would he believe me if I said this and he said
no. Then I went on to explain that if I believed purple unicorns
existed and he didn't, then I would have to prove this to him. He got
even more pissed and fired me and proceeded to tell me to go out and
do some research with alcohol until I was in enough pain to become
willing to believe in god. I thought that was irresponsable. I got
another sponsor and me and him did not do the steps, because he
thought they were absurd.

<p>
My second sponsor left AA because he thought it was too negative and
complete bullshit. He said it was taking a toll on his mental health.
I left about 3 months after he did.

<p>
A month before I left AA, a friend gave me a book, actually a fellow I
met in AA that thought AA was bullshit. Well he gave me a book called,
<a href="orange-top10.html#Resisting_12Step" target="_blank">
<i>'Resisting 12-Twelve Step Coercion: How to Fight Forced
Participitation in AA, NA, or 12-Step Treatment'</i>,
by Stanton Peele and Charles Bufe with Archie Brodsky</a>.

So I read it and it made perfect
sense to me.  About a week or so after I finished reading the book,
some AA member asked me to speak at a Speakers Meeting. I agreed and
this would be the last meeting I was ever at because of what I did.
My friend that gave me that book, dared me that when I spoke at that
meeting, to read out of that book and give my views on AA.  So, that
is what I did, I read the second chapter of the book, not all just a
few studies. Like the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">
Ditman study</a>
and the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Brandsma Study</a>.
I am sure
you know about those studies. There was at least 60 people at the
meeting, they were all looking at me like they were gonna murder me.
<p>
Well someone stopped me after about 10 minutes of my speech. It
appears you cannot say truthful facts about AA at the meetings. My
friend and I thought it was hilarious...
<p>
After the meeting a few people
pulled me aside and started bitching at me. About how what I spoke
about was irresponsible and was not helpful to the new comers. I told
them they were not helping the newcomers themselves and for shits and
giggles I told them god told me to speak about that subject and that I
was doing gods will. They told me I was not doing gods will, so I
asked them how did they know that, were they god. That pissed them off
even more for some reason. I thought it was funny cause I am an
atheist and just wanted a reaction out of them. So after that meeting, my friend and I never came back.

Hi Tim,
<p>
Thanks for an amusing story. I got a laugh out of it. The problem is, that I'm sure it's true,
and that baloney is really what the newcomers get from Alcoholics Anonymous.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Paul H-R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: Hi<br>

<p>

Hello Back Orange,
<p>
You know... You're absolutely right! I have been fooling myself this
whole time! How could I have ever been so fucking stupid as to think
that Alcoholics Anonymous has saved me from my seemingly hopeless and
helpless state of mind and body.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, it wasn't just your stupidity. You had a lot of help from fellow cult members who
kept telling you that the cult religion routine really works.
</font>
<p>



It boggles my mind to think that I
thought the last house on the block was AA, when all I had to do was
to hang out at the homeless shelters, stand on the street and beg for
money and just tough it out!! You know you're right Orange! I can't
beleive I ever allowed alcohol to make me crazed and obsessed over it
to the point that my whole life just got pulled out from under me like
a startled rattlesnake laying in the grassy knowles attacking
defensively with its poisoness venom, penetrating my veins and leaving
me paralized. Wow, you know you're absolutely right. I just found out
that AA is the largest cult in the world and that George W. Bush was
recently in a local meeting here in the area discussing the Islamic
anihalation strategy for 2007. Of course this was a closed meeting and
no &quot;outsiders&quot; were allowed, including converted ex neo-nazi jews that
created the Meth epidemic. The God of my understanding was a figment
of my imagination... just like a gold fish orbiting in it's oval
shaped bowl, forgetting about swimming halfway around and continues to
go in circles for the rest of its existence. That's me... a
brainwashed obsessive compulsive being, starving for compassion and
love. Just lonely and tired of failing a miserable life. I did it all!
You know, Orange, I did every last piece of it... I surrendered to my
alcoholism, I came to beleive, I turned it over, I did a moral
inventory of myself, I admitted it to another brainwashed soul, I
became ready to have it removed, I asked to have it removed, I made a
list of all the people that I so humbly treaded on in my addictions, I
made amends to them, I learned the useless dicipline of prayer and
meditation, and worst of all... I thought I had gained something from
taking those steps... and being so naive to think that I had the
ability to give someone else the opportunity to be led into the New
Wold Order cult of Alcoholics Anonymous, and to give them the power to
kill with fear-propaganda that alcohol kills and destroys thousands of
people all the time. I've led others into this mess, as I was lead
into it... my life today is so miserable because I have been able to
go back to college, I have healthy relationships with other people and
myself, I have a newfound concience that destroys me everyday because
my innechild is entwined in broken glass, screaming, crying out loud
that everything AA has done to me has created such misery in my life,
that it has become so unbearable while seeming so useless that it's
keeping from drinking one day at a time.
<p>
This is untrue, I was lying the whole time... OMG LYING!!!
<p>
<font color="blue">
I'll let that rant go...
<p>
Whether you were lying to yourself or simply deluded is a fine line, and an open question.
</font>
<p>

I'm
supposed to be &quot;rendered&quot; white as snow, am I not? AA does not have a
monopoly on getting clean and sober. This is something that is stated
clearly throughout the 12 traditions &amp; concepts. The primary purpose
is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to acheive sobriety. How it
works is a suggestion... you can take it or leave it, it's that
simple. Our book is meant to be suggestive only, we realize we know
only a little.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Then why are people sentenced to Alcoholics Anonymous, with the approval and connivance of the
A.A. elders and leaders?
Take it or leave it, like Hell. Take it or go to jail.
</font>
<p>

No one held us down and poured alcohol down our
throats, in the same way no one holds us down and force feeds us the
12 steps.
<p>
<font color="blue">
True. But what does that have to do with A.A.?
</font>
<p>


If you don't surrender to the program you're not a member,
because the only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop
drinking.
<p>
<font color="blue">
What if somebody wants to quit drinking <i>without surrendering</i> to a cult or a religion or any
other organization?<br>
The desire to quit drinking does not imply that someone should &quot;surrender&quot;.
You surrender to an enemy.
</font>
<p>

If you have such a desire and see something that you want,
stay... if not, we'll gladly refund your misery. Cult religion? More
like religious freedom! There is more Jesus bashing in AA meetings
than anywhere else!
<p>
<font color="blue">
And that proves what? (Besides the fact that A.A. is
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">a vicious heretical cult religion</a> that is not compatible with
Christianity...)
</font>
<p>

The sacrifices that are spoken of in AA are not
Cult Rituals, they are personal sacrifices we make to take time out of
our selfish schedule to contribute in service work.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is an irrelevant statement. I never said that you sacrificed chickens on a voodoo alter.  
<p>
But being forbidden from telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth &#8212; now that
is a sacrifice.
</font>
<p>

Like in any area,
there are a few bad personalities in there... afterall we are
alcoholics... However, these few people set the bad examples by 13th
stepping newcomers. These are both men and women and occur frequently.
These people create a bad vibe and can cause people like you to freak
out and prophesize your horrendous experience. I bet you were so
vulnerable when you came in that even Bill Clinton would have
fantasized about drinking brandy with you and smoking cuban cigars.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Huh? That makes no sense. And all that you are doing is minimizing and denying the faults of
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
But then,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Minimization and Denial</i></a> is something that alcoholics
are supposed to be very good at.
</font>
<p>
If anything, I protect the rooms from this type of behavior and majority
do! In fact, I know people that would get physically defensive if
there was something &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; going on in the rooms of AA,
including me. The police are a call away too. Now, I don't know where
you went to meetings, but it sounds like you had a bad experience...
kinda like bad trip on acid where conspiracy's run galore and
sand-elfs are causing tsunamis that will wipe out mankind... actually
it was NASA, Exxon and the Bush administration that orchestrated that
by drilling a huge hole into the indonesian earth plates and sending
down a hydrogen bomb causing the plates to grind an earthquake that
would kill hundreds of thousand of people... this of course to divert
the attention away from Iraq! Brilliant isn't it! I heard it at a
&quot;closed&quot; AA meeting. Sounds like fanatic lunacy has gotten the best of
you? Or maybe you did that all on your own? Well, whatever it is I
wish you the same amount of luck back! I hope that you are able to
convince the rest of the world that AA, as a whole, just sucks and has
caused more harm than done good? Better Thee, Than Me!!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I got most of my &quot;crazy&quot; ideas about Alcoholics Anonymous from reading the crazy
words of the Founder Bill Wilson in the <i>Big Book</i> and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
</font>
<p>

Take it easy, I admire your persistancy and ability to blow things
totally out of proportion... I mean I'm pretty good at it, but you're
like a God at it! Happy Resentments!

<p>

Paul

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Paul, do you feel better now?
<p>
You have not offered one shred of evidence that Alcoholics Anonymous actually makes
any alcoholics quit drinking, or even just drink less.
<p>
But you did supply some more evidence that A.A. is a jealous cult
religion that bashes Jesus Christ.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Orange,

<p>

First, a response, then some comments.

<p>
<a name="TedK2f"> </a>
I believe I made to comment concerning &quot;an altar to pray at&quot; to
demonstrate Orange's desire to collect funds while condemning AA for
doing so.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Ted,
<p>
That is a complete distortion of the facts of the situation, and it just isn't true.
I have never condemned A.A. for passing the hat at
meetings.
<a href="orange-letters27.html#pass_the_hat" target="_blank">I have repeatedly said</a>
that I considered the hat-passing to be one of the more charming aspects of
A.A., and that if they would stick to fund-raising that way, that A.A. would be a more spiritual
organization.
<p>
What I condemned was the Alcoholics Anonymous leaders going to the courts of Mexico and Germany
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">committing PERJURY to get A.A.
members sentenced to prison</a>.
You know what <i>perjury</i> is, don't you?
That is when you put your hand on a Bible and solemnly swear by God to tell the truth,
and then you lie like a rug.
<p>
Well that is what the Alcoholics Anonymous leaders did,
in order to make more money by forcing people to buy over-priced
copies of <i>OUT OF COPYRIGHT</i> old editions of the <i>Big Book</i>.
That is a felony, maybe two or three: perjury, fraud, conspiracy...
<p>
Surely you must have the wits about you to be able to tell the different
between passing the hat at meetings and committing felony perjury against
innocent people who are just trying to help others?
</font>

<p>

I have made sparingly few posts recently, though I am a fundamentalist
Christian.  I guess you could consider me to be a scientific
Christian???  It's probably not appropriate for me to drop names, but I
graduated with credentials in teaching most scientific fields including
more than one flavour of  biophysics.  No bragging here, I'm just trying
to let you know know a little of my background.

<p>

We can further discuss faith if you like, but here is one question:

<p>
<a name="TedK2c"> </a>

Why do you call AA a cult?  I have read a few anti-AA definitions of
cult and they are sorely lacking.  It seems to me that these folks have
made up their own definitions of cult.  I have studied religious
apologetics for many years and apologists have been studying cults for
hundreds (thousands?) of years.  It seems to me that they have the
better right to definite cult and not Johnny-come-lately, anti-12 step,
self-defined scientists.

<p>

The singular characteristic of a cult is that the follower &quot;must&quot; be
removed from their family.  AA fails miserably in meeting this definition.

<p>

Ted, the anti-Agent Orange

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ted, read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>
to get my definition of a cult.
A.A. passes the test admirably.
<p>
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_total_immersion" target="_blank">The social isolation</a>
of which you speak of is merely one out of a hundred of the common cult
characteristics. Not all cults separate members from their families or their circle of former friends.
But they do the majority of the other things.
<p>
Furthermore,
<a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor" target="_blank">I have received complaints</a>
of A.A. doing just that: Taking over the convert's life
and removing him from his family, and turning him against his family,
and making A.A., and only A.A., his new social circle and his new world.
Check out that link.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

Yes, it sounds to me like that guy you know who recklessly speeds, is manic to some
degree.  Of course, this could go to different degrees.  I probably told you about
my series of webpages about hyperthymic personalities, starting at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html</a>,
as well as a webpage that summarizes
all this, at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm</a>.
Just after
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html#research" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html#research</a>, I have a table that I got out
of a book, headed &quot;Common Symptoms of Mania,&quot; which looks to me like it really
describes hyperthymic personality, hypomania, and then mania.  This shows how,
though in the old days &quot;mania&quot; meant only psychosis, but now one could see how
impairment can go to different degrees.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

In another part of that webpage, at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html#unambiguous" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html#unambiguous</a>,
I describe how I once
diagnosed a very hyperthymic boyfriend.  He's a neurologist since he always knew
that his usual personality and talents are very different from the average, but he
didn't know why until I recognized him engaging in the behavior pattern that's the
most distinctive sign of a hyperthymic temperament.  That is, getting agitated about
something trivial by going hysterical for a few seconds to a few minutes, and then
suddenly acting like everything's normal again as if he suddenly snapped out of
something.  He doesn't have moods when he acts hyped-up.  He always acts like that.
Because of this, when he was behind the wheel, and stressed-out, in a hurry to get
somewhere, under pressure about his driving, etc., that could have made him speed.
This worked like temporary insanity, since after he was out of the stressful
situation, he'd say that he was very aware of how dangerous that was, but when he'd
do it, he simply felt an irrational need to.  And once, I heard an obviously
hyperthymic friend of his (bubbly like my uncle), tell of a woman who that friend
knows who suddenly starts speeding for no good reason, though he keeps telling her
that's dangerous...

<p>

I'd suggest that you try to pressure your friend into doing something to stop his
dangerous driving, such as taking some medication.  Anti-seizure medications that
are used for bipolar disorder are more likely not to change the usual vivacious
personality, but does control the problems.  Maybe when he's not actively manic he'd
be more able to see how dangerous his own behavior is, so you could try to talk
about it with him then.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sharen,
<p>
He takes lithium now and then. As is usual with lithium, he doesn't like it because
it makes him feel emotionally flat.
</font>


<p>
Regarding your e-mail about the Gam-Anon chapter, I think that copyright laws give
you more of a right to copy text that you then express criticism of, than text that
you copy as something that you think is a good idea.  Our freedom to criticize
requires a freedom to give an example of what we're criticizing.  Also, if we're
criticizing it, then we're obviously not parasitizing off of it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that makes sense.
</font>
<p>


<p>

And, as I go into on my webpages about victim correction as a panacea, telling
people to deal with their own problems self-reliantly through self-help, even if it
means addicts' kids deciding, &quot;I've stopped blaming others, and I'm looking at
myself!&quot;, is basically how our culture tells us to deal with our own problems.  The
personal responsibility that it takes most seriously, is response-ability for one's
own welfare, one's own problems, rather than even the worldliest ethical
responsibility.  As I go into on my webpages, intercultural studies have
consistently found that depressed people who've lived outside of the modern West
have tended to feel paranoid, but modern Westerners, whether depressed or not, tend
to figure that even if someone did &quot;get you,&quot; that would mean only that you lost the
battle so you're a loser.

<p>

After all, that conception of personal responsibility is more reliable, since people
are more motivated to deal with their own problem than they are to take even the
worldliest ethical responsibility.  That conception is also more honorable, since
response-ability for one's own welfare is self-reliant, while ethical responsibility
could have implications of manipulative ploys, or, at the very least, &quot;The concept
of good is divided into two subspecies, that of the directly present satisfaction of
the will in each case, and that of its merely indirect satisfaction concerning the
future, in other words, the agreeable and the useful.  The concept of the opposite,
so long as we are speaking of beings without knowledge, is expressed by the word
bad, more rarely and abstractly by the word evil, which therefore denotes everything
that is not agreeable to the striving of the will in each case.&quot;  Christian
forgiveness could also look like the epitome of being well-adjusted.  While training
addicts' kids to have attitudes of, &quot;I've stopped blaming others, and I'm looking at
myself!&quot;, might seem insanely pragmatic stouthearted and forgiving, the fact still
remains that addicts' kids who have this outlook, would be a lot more likely to
succeed than if they had the same parents but didn't adopt this attitude.

<p>

And the fact that, as you said on another webpage, this is, &quot;one of those key things
that opens so many avenues of understanding,&quot; has a lot to do with the fact that

<p>

That conception of personal responsibility might sound very all-American, but
obviously it's never been tested as to how endurable its effects are.  There are a
lot of questions that need to be answered, that won't be as long as we figure that
this is simply what &quot;personal responsibility&quot; means.

<p>

And regarding your splitting your webpages up into smaller ones, I don't know if
your webpage editing program could do this, but Microsoft Front Page allows the
&quot;Replace&quot; function to work on the HTML code of webpages, and also allows one to
replace in &quot;All Pages.&quot;  When I split up some on my webpages, I changed my own links
to them from the old URLs to the new ones, by:<br>
<ul>
<li> a.. opening any document up,<br>
<li> b.. displaying its HTML code rather than displaying it in &quot;Normal&quot; mode,<br>
<li> c.. calling on the &quot;Replace&quot; function,<br>
<li> d.. telling it to replace the old URL with its new URL, and<br>
<li> e.. telling it to replace this in &quot;All pages.&quot;<br>
</ul>

Then it would do the replacing in the HTML code, so the links are what would change.

<p>

(Ever since I was a teenager, anyone who didn't have a chronically manic personality
seemed half dead to me, smirk, smirk.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, I am running Linux, so the Micro$uck programs are out of the question.
I also have 227 files to check and edit. A large file like the <i>Propaganda Techniques</i>
file has hundreds of links into and out of it, and any of the other 226 files may have links
into the file, pointing to specific named anchors, all of which will get moved into other files
when the big file is split up. But that's okay. Unix and Linux have other tools to use to
do the job. It's still just a lot of work.

Have a good day.

Subject:  	Comment on your paper<br>

<p>

I want to make this comment on your paper regarding the Effectiveness of AA.
<p>
I have now been sober for 2 years after years of drinking heavily.  I don't
often attend AA now although I did at first.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Glenda,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety. It is good that you chose to stop drinking so much.
</font>
<p>

<p>
However, the most important thing AA did teach me was a new way of thinking
which helped me to deal with problems in healthy ways for the first time in
my life (I am now 56).  I can say with complete sincerity AA definitely
helped move me in the right direction toward making healthier decisions.
<p>
<font color="blue">
What does that mean, in plain English?
That statement is pure psycho-babble, just vague slogans and buzz-words, and could mean anything.
</font>
<p>

<p>
I wonder if the person who wrote this ever attended an AA meeting?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, many of them. Please read at least
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction to the web site, here</a>.
</font>
<p>

I doubt it
because the part of AA that helps the alcoholic with new ways of dealing with life's
problems is one of the most important parts of AA and to a person who is truly
listening, in most meetings this is evident.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are just spouting vague slogans. <i>Precisely what</i> did A.A. teach you, and
how did that make you decide to stop drinking?
<p>
Or did you really quit drinking <i>before</i>
&quot;working the program&quot; and learning that &quot;new way of thinking&quot;?
</font>
<p>

AA is what helped me, not any
&quot;spontaneous&quot; remission from acoholism. I also know people who have been sober for
20 years who have experienced the &quot;miracle&quot; of AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<b><i>How</i></b> did A.A. &quot;help you&quot;?  What did A.A. really do?
<p>
And how on earth did you establish a cause-and-effect relationship between A.A. supposedly teaching
you a new way of thinking, and your quitting drinking?
<p>
Just because you went to some A.A. meetings does not mean that A.A. <i>caused</i> you to quit
drinking.
<p>
<font color="green">
<i>
<ul>
<li>
A bunch of people went to a Baptist church for years.<br>
<li>
During those years, many of the women got pregnant and had babies.<br>
<li>
That proves it:
Going to Baptist churches <b>causes</b> women to get pregnant and have babies.
</ul>
</font></i>


<p>
You say that your quitting drinking was not spontaneous remission.
How would you know that?
<p>
So when did you quit drinking, and
when did you go to your first A.A. meeting?
<p>
And when did you finish doing all 12 of the Steps?
<p>
If you quit drinking before finishing the 12 Steps, then the Steps did not make you quit drinking.
<p>
And since you aren't going to meetings any more, it sure isn't A.A. that is keeping you sober.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Re: Comment on your paper<br>

<p>

Hi,

<p>

I wanted to post this reply on your web site in response to this but couldnt find
the letter or your reply.  As you  suggested, I did pull up and read your entire
introduction.  Sounds like you had some very bad experiences with AA and I am sorry
that happened.  All groups are not alike though.

<p>

The AA group I  attended for a year was not like the group you described and my
sponsor helped me so much.  Your being forced to attend was not a good way to get
into any recovery program because the desire or need would have needed to come from
you.

<p>

In answer to your questions,

<p>

These are some of  specific things I learned in AA
<ul>

<li>  to ask for and live according to spiritual guidance from my Higher Power
<li>  to think things through before acting or reacting
<li>  if I want to take a drink , to  think it all the way through to what would/could
happen  if I did
<li>   to daily meditate and pray and live in such a way that I can respect myself
<li>  to be helpful to others in small as well as larger ways (most of which are
totally unrelated to drinking)
<li>  that there are many others like me out there who have a problem with drinking and
the support of AA has helped and does help
</ul>

<p>

Others around me have seen an noticeable change in me for the better  according to
what they tell me. When I drank, I worked a full time job, never got a DUI (lucky),
and didnt get into any real trouble but it was definitely controlling my life and I
would have eventually been into some deep trouble because my drinking was
progressive.

<p>

I did quit drinking 3 days before I went to AA so, yes, I made this decision myself.
However,   The only reason I did not return to drinking in that first year was  the
support and encouragement of the group and of my sponsor as well as attending
meetings and listening.  I still have that support from both my boyfriend (with 19
years of sobriety in AA) and from my sponsor (with 13 years of sobriety, also in
AA).  I also know there are many people I can call who will give me needed support
not to drink without telling me what to do.
<p>
I had quit drinking through the last 30 years about 10 or more times and each time I
returned to drinking pretty heavily after a time.  Thats how I know I am an
alcholic. I could quit drinking &#8212; that part was easy.  I just could not stay quit.

<p>

You sound very angry with AA from the things you say about it and I apologize for
your bad experiences; however, there are people who AA has helped and these are not
people in a cult any more than people who attend church every weel are in a cult.

<p>

I know that people respond to different ways of recovery; I do not think AA is the
only way.  All I know is that it helped me to continue not to drink until I became
stronger and for that I am eternally greatful. If I ever begin having strong urges
to drink again, I will be at more AA meetings because it works for me.

<p>

Please just consider that different people find ways to sobriety that works for them
and that AA is one way that has worked and still works for some people.

<p>

Blessings and Peace<br>

Hello Glenda,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
My opposition to Alcoholics Anonymous is not just a matter of having had a bad experience
with a 12-Step based treatment center, although that's a part of it.
I am opposed to A.A. because it does more harm than good, and A.A. constantly lies about its
success rate and its real achievements in helping alcoholics.
<p>
And A.A. does a lot more than that. I've already written it all down.
Read the file
<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.</a>.

<p>
Now you may have personally gotten some comfort and moral support from associating with A.A. members,
but many other people got misinformed, hurt, raped, or driven to relapse or suicide.
You were lucky.
<p>
Even one of the leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant,
who is a member of the Board of Trustees of A.A. Services, Inc., 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">discovered from his
eight years of rigorous testing of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>, that A.A. killed more people than it helped.
<p>
And lately I have been getting reports that the A.A. youth groups are really bad for young women.
Read these two items:
<ul>
<li> Washington DC has a large A.A. group for young people that specializes in the sexual exploitation
of under-age girls by old sponsors.
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.

<li> the Phoenix, Arizona, Young People's A.A. says that the group exists solely
for &quot;cars, pussy, and money&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.

</ul>
<p>
That's the dark underside of Alcoholics Anonymous. And that is going on right now, and that is also
&quot;the Real A.A.&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Re: Perennially Relevant<br>

<p>
Hi Again, Orange!

<p>
I just looked at that website with
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://www.ep.tc/aa-comics" target="_blank">the Al-Anon comics</a>, including the series &quot;If Your
Parents Drink too Much.&quot;  Frankly, this has the same logic as the ads, guides, for
treating our rampant depression that I go into on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/VictCorrSummary317.htm" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/VictCorrSummary317.htm</a>,
that depressive disorders
affect 34,000,000 American adults, so 34,000,000 American adults should take
antidepressants, or learn to have optimistic outlooks.  As usual, the first frame of
that comic series says how big the problem is, &quot;At least one child in thirteen lives
in an alcoholic home....&quot;  It's so predictable that books about depression give the
statistics for how many Americans have it, in the very beginning, that often when I
want to cover a book on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/VictCorrSummary317.htm" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/VictCorrSummary317.htm</a>, I go
to the first pages to find the statistics, and then compare those to the title of
the book, which is usually about how each depressed individual could deal with his
own problem.

<p>
The series of comics go into how real the kids' problems are, but they're taught not
only, &quot;I've stopped blaming other and I'm looking at myself!&quot;, but also, &quot;Ala-Teen
taught me how to let go of my father's drinking problem and still care about him!&quot;
and, &quot;I learned that alcoholism is a disease and that I can be happy in spite of my
mother's drinking!&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'd really like to know how the 12 Steps are supposed to teach children that...
(<i>&quot;Let me confess all of my moral shortcomings and defects of character some more...&quot;</i>)
</font>
<p>
Yet, in totally pragmatic terms, if each of these teens successfully coached
him/herself into having that attitude, they'd be most likely to succeed.  Linda, who
has to do the housework since her mom isn't, would still have to do the same
housework, but she'd probably grow up to feel less helpless.  Frank, whose dad beats
up his wife and who has to get a job to have money, couldn't change these facts, but
could change not only how confident he'd grow up to be, but also how well he
succeeds at school since he became clear-headed and confident.  Randy wouldn't be a
degenerate hippy delinquent drug-pusher, and wouldn't have run away at the end,
maybe getting into the van of a child molester.  Since just after his dad
temporarily sobered-up, Randy is shown wearing a square-looking sweater and with his
hair combed, obviously he did &quot;let go&quot; rather than feeling resentment about his
dad's past drinking, but that doesn't seem to be good enough.  The whole idea is
that at least one child in thirteen lives in an alcoholic home, so at least one
child in thirteen would benefit greatly if he learned to deal with such realities in
such an unconditional, failsafe fashion.

Subject:  	Using coins to calculate retention of cult members.<br>

<p>

I don't think you've taken into account the folks who just go back once a year just
to pick up a coin and rub it into their faces. If you factor that in, you'll find
that AA retention rates are actually lower than you think.
<p>

My first year coin was
actually a 37th year coin. That came about because by the time the first year came
around I was already long gone and just stopped in to touch base with someone who was
(and probably still is) a major AA cultie who I had doing various things for me
while I travelled like looking after my cat. So I stopped back a week earlier than
the monthly &quot;birthday party&quot; to pick up my coin (my &quot;sobriety&quot; date fell on the
22nd. I was told to put my name on the board for the month end festivities. I did
and stopped back for it on the (traditional for this group) last Saturday of the
month.

<p>

So I stopped back and the person in charge never did like my views on the whole pack
of lies that makes up AA. That and never getting a sponsor, spending a lot of time
in bars for food and tea since my friends still drank and not getting a sponsor
*ever* sort of teed off this control freak. Each of the &quot;birthday celebrants&quot; gets
to come up with someone to speak for them, then they're presented a coin. Needless
to say, I wasn't allowed up by the control freak who called an end to it after
everyone else had their little speeches. So at the end I just grabbed any coin and I
later found out it was a 37 year coin.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that's funny.
</font>
<p>

Now each year I go to one of the AA groups and snag a coin. I don't go to any of the
meetings otherwise. The last few times I've been asked to comment  I simply  tell
them what I had   prepared for the first year birthday.

<p>

&quot;If you want to stop drinking, don't fucking drink.&quot;

<p>

It's worked for me.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Edvo,
<p>
Thanks for a funny and entertaining letter.
<p>
About the line:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I don't think you've taken into account the folks who just go back once a year just

that AA retention rates are actually lower than you think.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I've considered it, but cannot calculate any numbers for it.
I mentioned in a few places the people who only go to one A.A. meeting a year,
just to pick up another coin.
<p>
I also fell into that category for a while. When I went to pick up my one-year coin, years ago now,
I had not been to an A.A. meeting in nearly a year, because I was very slow to go get the coin, and
I really had 18 months of sobriety by then, and had not
gone to an A.A. meeting since picking up the 6-month coin.
(And I had not gone to an A.A. meeting in 2 or 3 months when I got the 6-month coin. I was going to
SMART instead.)

<p>
When I noticed that A.A. boosters were claiming that all of the people who were picking up coins were
proof that the A.A. program works, I stopped picking up coins.
I am now due my 2nd through 6th year coins, but I doubt that I will ever go get them.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Thanks Orange!!!<br>

<p>

A.O.,

<p>

I have wanted to write you for years and thank you for
your work, past and present.  I have been
procrastinating because I wanted to write a brilliant
essay for your ever-expanding letters section... I may
still do that one day!!!  For now we'll just just have
to settle for a &quot;Thank You&quot; and a bit about my
trying-to-get-better experience.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tom,
<p>
Actually, you did write a very good letter.
</font>
<p>

I have been reading your work since '02... previously
linked from apple's aadeprogramming site. I walked out
of my last AA meeting on Christmas Eve 2002 and made a
commitment to myself never to go to another 12-step
meeting for the rest of my life.  Unfortunately, I
went to bar after that meeting... for that night I had
better company at the bar than at that meeting. Those
meetings were LONELY... and I knew everyone.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I have been struggling with alcoholism my entire adult
life. I am writing this at 41 years of age with 2 days
dry.  Went to my first AA meeting in '89 and stayed 3
years... went &quot;back out&quot;... came back via
&quot;treatment&quot;... 6 months... back &quot;out&quot;... back in 1.5
years... back out... tried going back again and again
and again 60 days... not more than 30 days in a row in
the past 6 years, though I have been trying at least
once every quarter, if not more often, in that period.
<p>
It has gotten bad... I can't detox without medication
even if I drink for two nights.  My body can't take
it, but I keep going back to it and keep stopping. 30
days seems to be a major hurdle... usually when bills
are due???  I have lost a lot, but still have a place
to live... barely. I get suicidal a lot.  I've been to
doctors and county mental health so many times.  They
ALL say go to AA, I say I have been doing that for
over 15 years and it doesn't work for me.  &quot;Dual
Diagnosis&quot;... they won't listen to anything I say or
how I feel... their agenda is me going to AA. (Or they
reluctantly mention SMART, which I have investigated
online, but has very few meetings and they are not
close by).  Suicidal??... try getting an AA sponsor and
reading the Big Book and 90 meetings in 90 days!!!
[IMG: me flipping the bird]  I mean I was serious
about AA... I really tried and worked those steps and
went to different meetings and got different sponsors.
<p>
But it IS all a lie.  Nobody in there has ANY idea
what it is all about because it is all a sick riddle
created by a sick man who wanted people to follow him.
No one wants to admit that they were taken and that
all their beliefs are indoctrinated and their &quot;AA
personal history&quot; is fake. Both of my parents are
heavy AAers, and that has really made things a chore
for me emotionally.  Thankfully they have mellowed on
the Nazi-scale over the years and seem to be able to
talk to me without their AA goggles tinted too darkly.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I know the answer for me is &quot;Just don't drink no
matter what&quot;. I just have not been able to maintain
that, even though I have proven that I CAN do it.
I've always done it for myself... never via the law,
etc.  Just for my own emotional and physical heath.  I
have determined that smoking pot will ultimately lead
to my justifying a drink.  Keeping my head clear is
imperative.
<p>
The best news:  I HAVE BEEN NICOTINE-FREE
FOR SIX MONTHS!!!!!!!   Thanks to you, Orange!!!!
(Well, I did it, but you motivated me.

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://www.whyquit.org/" target="_blank">whyquit.org</a>
was helpful, as well).
<p>
It's amazing that I have drank
5th after 5th and not smoked a single tobacco product
in six months.  Really, THANK YOU.  Your writings
helped me a lot there.  I smoked Phillip Morris
products for over 25 years.  Wish I had a dime rebate
for every pack I smoked.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Anyway, I am like you... I cannot drink moderately.  In
the past months I have only drank alone, at home, to
blackout/passout for multi-day binges around the
clock. Then I quit and try to restore my health the
best I can, but I pick it back up again. I don't want
to do it.  It is bizzare and incredibly painful and
uncomfortable... it is like I am watching myself from
the outside doing it but unable to control it.
<p>
For me
it is progressive and every time I drink... even after
periods of abstinence, my withdrawal symptoms get
worse and more disturbing. Sometimes suicide is more
comforting that another round of DT's (the doctor is
sick of me coming in for Librium and keeps pushing AA
or other &quot;recovery&quot; homes)... but I am still alive and
kicking... I am still trying to make it.  I hope I
will.
<p>
I seem to do OK once I get some time under my
belt. I just CANNOT have even one beer (or joint).
Gotta watch the coffee/sugar binging, too.  That
throws my moods into a tailspin.  I think I may be
bipolar or something... somthing more than just
depression... but I can't get an honest evaluation
because our medical and social services systems are
fully AA indoctrinated. One thing is for CERTAIN: I
will never go to another AA meeting or have any
involvement in 12 step activities for the rest of my
life... NO MATTER WHAT.  Oh, and I don't smoke
cigarettes...

Date:  	Tue, October 3, 2006 10:54 am<br>
From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Parental Alcoholism, Per Se, Considered Abusive<br>

<p>
Hi Again, Orange!

<p>
First off, I figured that I might as well mention how seriously the law takes the
negative effects of parental alcoholism, per se, and how different this is from the
Ala-Teen approach.  Another of my boyfriends worked for a non-profit organization
that mediated disputes, especially within families.  He told me that not only was he
mandated to report overt abuse of kids, he also had to report simply when a parent
was alcoholic.  It should seem obvious that most cases of alcoholism would lead, at
the very least, to a lot of verbal abuse of kids.

<p>

Also, I just sent the following to Mark Foley's lawyer.  Let's see what happens!

<p>

Rather than a potential client, I'm e-mailing you about Mark Foley.  Even before I
heard his representatives attribute his problem to &quot;emotional&quot; problems and
&quot;mental illness,&quot; his whole situation and personality sounded to me like a
hyperthymic, or chronically manic, personality.  I have plenty of practical
familiarity with this, and have some webpages on them, one at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm</a>, and a series on them starting at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142913/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html" target="_blank">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html</a>.

<p>
If that's is the case, then I'd
suggest that Mark Foley not only come out and say so publicly, but also talk about
the positive attributes of hyperthymic personalities that he has, such as his good
sense of humor, and his whole attractive that's causing so many of his friends to
back him even in this situation.  The more years that pass by, the less
stigmatized that mood disorders have become, and the more hated that pedophilia
has become, so this would certainly help him.  This could also make the public
aware of hyperthymic personalities, which are so common that awareness of their
characteristics would do a lot of people a lot of good!

(Ever since I was a teenager, anyone who didn't have a chronically manic personality
seemed half dead to me, smirk, smirk.)

Hi Sharen,
<p>
I wonder how the lawyer reacted to that...
It probably went over like a lead balloon.
<p>
We know that what followed was Foley publicly proclaiming that a priest molested him when
he was a boy...

<p>
But just because a priest molested him didn't mean that Foley had to go do it to other kids...
We aren't talking about a contagious disease here.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.
