When Frank Buchman died in 1961, in Freudenstadt, Germany,
one of his disciples, Peter Howard, took over the leadership of
Moral Re-Armament, but he only lived for a few more years himself.
Still, Peter Howard managed to promote the same hateful insane ultra-Right-wing
philosophy of MRA during what little time he had remaining. He
wrote and published a book, <i>Britain and the Beast</i>,
which, among other things, continued the attacks on homosexuals.
Howard devoted two whole chapters, out of the 14 chapters in his book,
to attacking homosexuals.
In the chapter titled &quot;Queens and Queers&quot;,
Howard complained bitterly about a Sunday sermon that he had heard
on the radio which preached tolerance and charity towards homosexuals:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Homosexuals use such broadcasts to justify their ways.
They protest that they are not propagandists. But it is a lie.
(Homosexuals tell many lies. It is part of their retreat and cover from life.)
They try to make others homosexual to ease the sting of their uncertainty.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is this propagandizing of the homosexuals as well as their mutual protection
that creates the close-knit confraternity of the 'boys' around the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At one point 264 homosexuals were reported to have been
purged from the American State Department. Many of them moved from
Washington to New York and took jobs with the United Nations, drifting
back to Washington after a year or two.
But men of this sort have links with men of the same sort in Britain and
in other lands. There are no barriers of class, colour, country in the land
of Sodom.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="ftnt065_ret"> </a>
<font color="blue">
Two hundred and sixty-four homosexuals in the State Department?
That sounds just like Senator Joseph McCarthy the Red-baiter, waving a
piece of paper in the air and claiming that he had the names of 205 Communists
who worked in the State Department (whom he never did identify, in
spite of many repeated requests from the Senate subcommittees that were investigating
McCarthy's charges).<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt065">65</a></sup></font>
</font>

<p>
And Peter Howard seems to have found homosexuals <i>everywhere</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A boy who last year [1962] left a well-known public school said to me,
'At the school I left recently, about eighty per cent of the boys went through
some homosexual experience.'<br>

a man wrote from Seattle, on 24 January 1963, 'In my lifetime I have known

I am a homosexual myself.'<br>

to staff his 'team' with his own people.<br>

Considering
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9">Peter Howard's history of
involvement with fascism</a>, it was probably not just a coincidence
that Peter Howard's denunciations of homosexuals were very similar &#8212;
almost identical &#8212; to those voiced by Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...he [Heinrich Himmler] explained how homosexuals in positions of influence,
instead of choosing subordinates for their professional competence, chose them
because they were homosexual. This was an argument Hitler had used a year before to
Diels; he had lectured him on the role of the homosexual in history. Now Himmler
used precisely the same analogy as Hitler had to explain the point. Diels, who
could not have heard or read Himmler's talk, described Hitler as saying:
'Look, if I have the choice between a lovely but incompetent girl as a secretary
and one who is capable but hideous, I decide all too easily in favour of the lovely
incompetent.' So it was with homosexuals appointing men to posts, he went on;
if they were to acquire influence the National Socialist state would soon be
in the hands of these creatures and their lovers'.<font size="-1"><sup>50</sup></font><br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Himmler was seldom content with making a point once. He continued at length to
explain how the man appointed for his sexual bent would act in the same way
when he came to make an appointment. Thus in a masculine state if you found
one man of such an inclination in a position 'you could with certainty find
three, four, eight, ten and still more people of the same bent.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He added that the homosexual was a pathological liar. He, Himmler, had not known this
in the beginning, since to a normal person it was so alien. He and Heydrich and a
couple of other colleagues really had to learn in this area from vile experience.
Now he no longer asked a homosexual if he could give his word, for the homosexual
in the instant he said something was convinced it was true. Interestingly, this
is exactly what Professor Gebhardt had said of Himmler himself.<br>

About sex between married couples, Peter Howard wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Indulgence by the married, while having the cloak of legitimacy, may
nevertheless be the source of irritable tempers and of inability to answer
to the real needs of the children. Parents indulgent inside marriage
need not be surprised if their children are indulgent outside marriage.
A union which could otherwise be powerful for remaking the nation
thus remains a soft and uninspiring association.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Notice the completely groundless declarations: <i>Sexual indulgence by
married couples produces irritable tempers.</i>
Since when? What study or poll or survey ever found that? It seems like not getting laid
is far more likely to produce irritable tempers.

<p>
Likewise, how does sexual indulgence by married couples
make parents unable to &quot;answer
to the real needs of the children&quot;? Who ever established anything like that?
That is completely baseless.
<p>
Nevertheless, undisturbed by the lack of any supporting facts for their
crazy ideas, Peter Howard and Paul Campbell dogmatically declared that
sex between married couples is bad.
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, it was standard MRA practice at their centers like Mackinac Island
and Caux to demand that even married couples sleep in sexually-segregated
quarters. It seems that because Frank Buchman could not openly indulge his
sexual appetites, nobody else could either.

<p>
Unlikely as it may seem, Peter Howard still somehow managed to come up with two sons,
Philip and Anthony, and a daughter,
Anne, who married a British member of Parliament in
1962.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt145">145</a></sup></font>

We have to ask, &quot;Was Peter Howard actually another closeted homosexual?
Or was he bi?&quot;
Frank Buchman put on a big show of homophobia to hide his own homosexuality,
and one has to ask whether Peter Howard was doing the same thing.
Howard was married, but he was also one of the MRA leaders who
condemned sex between a man and his wife...

<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Nicolson">Peter Howard had close homosexual friends when he
was a student at Oxford</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Of the recruits Mosley was able to secure, the most prestigious was the
Hon. Harold Nicolson, &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
[a] fastidious, well-connected habitu&eacute; of London's
intellectual, literary world, with his dreams of youth and glory &nbsp; ...
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nicolson was a homosexual who was attracted to virile and manly youths
of the better classes. His young Oxford friends comprised not just
intellectuals like Christopher Hobhouse, but also undergraduates of a
quite different type, like Peter Howard, 'charming and forceful but
terribly immature', captain of the Oxford, and soon to be captain of the
England, Rugby team.<br>

<p>
So just how friendly were Harold Nicolson and the &quot;charming and
forceful&quot; Peter Howard, anyway?
<p>
Then funny phrases keep turning up in Peter Howard's writings &#8212; Freudian slips? &#8212; like
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-rroot150.html#licked">licked by impurity</a>&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#intimate_Himmler">not intimate</a>&quot;</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>

The heterosexual, promiscuous person ordinarily has an aggressive spirit,
and not infrequently is possessed by a short volatile temper.

<p>
&quot;Licked by impurity&quot;? Now that sounds sexy. And who was more
pious than Frank Buchman and his &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;absolutely pure&quot; followers?

<i>(Oh, and I have to ask: If

does that mean that the <font color="#af0000">homosexual</font>

</font>
<p>
Frank Buchman attracted a lot of attention
and criticism back in the nineteen-thirties
for associating with high-ranking Nazis like
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Himmler1">Heinrich Himmler</a>.
Peter Howard wrote that Buchman never met Hitler
(<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_not_changed">which was probably untrue</a>), and then added:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Nor was Buchman an intimate of Himmler or of any other member of the Nazi
hierarchy.<br>

<p>
Not an intimate of Himmler? That is avoiding the question.
Nobody was asking whether Frank Buchman and Heinrich Himmler got in bed together; they were
asking how sympathetic Frank Buchman was to the Nazi philosophy and goals.

Peter Howard denied that Moral Re-Armament was basically dead on its feet, an
idea whose time had gone. He alternated between declaring it victorious
and wallowing in self-pity, complaining about the criticism that MRA received:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Moral Re-Armament is an army on the march throughout the world united

by favours, nor halted by lies, threats or ruthless bullying. It is a winning march.<br>
