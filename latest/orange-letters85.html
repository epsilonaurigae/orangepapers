From:  	&quot;James G&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Busy as you are &#8212; I hope you will post this....<br>

<p>

I have CCd Ken on this but it is written to Orange.

<p>

So Blamedenial has yet another rebirth but with a twist of lemon. Eric F has
agreed to run the site, answer the emails, and generally make the posts that
feed the appetite of the visitors that still dare to peruse the site many
love to hate, and hate to love.

<p>

After the events that unfolded towards the end of last year I felt that I
was no longer in a position to run such a venture, and have for sometime
been looking for an exit strategy. I miss making the boring monologues that
were my videos; I miss the creativity, I miss the distraction, I miss all
the crashes, but above all I miss the controversy. The latter I add, because
I miss it for all the wrong reasons. It bates one like euphoric recall might
when we look back on our substance of choice with favour. Controversy online
has all the intensity to create a rush, but it also lacks the intimacy that
might force one to feel guilty for enjoying the whole fiasco.  Call it an
English trait, but I recall that someone far wiser than myself wrote that an
Englishman is only happy when he has persuaded the world he is in
discomfort.

<p>

We have what the Romans would have called an amphitheatre. Battles are
fought and won, reputations gained and lost, and groups formed as well as
disbanded. For a time it is entertaining, or even, edutaining. I add the
latter because it is possible to learn something from all this, and not just
about the individual, but about all the valid points of contention with
regards to AA.

<p>

This is for the most part a debate conducted online and I urge people to
never forget that loyalty, friendship and the like are most fickle on here,
as they are elsewhere. There was a time when I dreamed of making this whole
spectacle my life; getting a law degree, qualifying and fighting to prove to
the establishment that AA is wrong &#8212; all that changed sometime ago when I
learned that in order to do this I would have to deny my own thoughts, my
own feelings, and silence myself yet again, as I had done in the rooms. AA
has little respect for the individual, but they are not alone in that
outlook.  Trust, decency, an acceptance of error in light of absolute
personal turmoil, are lost on many in this debate. The individual, as an
entity becomes fair fodder in this 'game', regardless of the points they
make, whether they are right or not.

<p>

Despite my cowardly retreat from the fray for now, I would encourage more
people to speak their views &#8212; if you are human, and thus err from time to
time, you will be shot down, exposed, humiliated, but if you can stick
around, battle on so to speak, you might meet a handful of people willing to
learn from you as well as teach you. As always balance is the key.  And
should anyone else like myself ever arrive with all my faults, please let AA
do the deed of revealing those faults &#8212; they are in fact irrelevant to this
whole debate, and by condoning the actions of those who have done this all
we do is persuade others not to take the risk of speaking their thoughts.
Any alcoholic or addict is going to have skeletons in the closet; in fact
anyone who has lived is.  I think we might call it airing our dirty laundry
in public. The result in my case is that I still have a passion to question
AA but I do not wish to offer any support to the antics employed by either
extreme.

<p>

And with that I ask that you give Eric a chance to take over from the
abysmal job I was doing at Blamedenial and see where he can take it. One
thing on Eric's side is that he employs a sense of humour and behind that
guise is hidden a humanity that is very much needed, and welcomed by myself,
in this whole furore.  I shall stick around for the time being on the side
lines helping Eric with the maintenance of the site, but he is free to
express anything he chooses. I think he is very brave to take on the
responsibility of a website that has meant so well but failed to achieve
anything of value. In his favour however are the number of visitors to the
site, and the opportunity to turn that around. I would hope that the likes
of Agent Orange, Ken Ragge, Stanton Peele et al. offer him the support he
deserves for having the courage to present something to this intense debate.

<p>

And to end a final thought in a very Jerry Springer way &#8212; whether the
individual who questions lives the perfect existence in terms of our value
system means so little &#8212; what is of paramount importance is whether their
points are valid, and should they prove to be so, then they deserve to be
answered. Finding people who have left AA, or are on the fringes, who are
perfect and without fault is unlikely to happen. I might even add that those
who swear by AA do not exist either. If Blamedenial has failed thus far, so
be it, but for all the effort I have made let that be my final lesson to all
those who want to expose AA for what it is &#8212; stick to the points, stick to
the facts, stick to the reality otherwise we have no chance of making any
difference whatsoever.  I leave this with more regrets than I did when I
left AA &#8212; let that be food for thought, but that said, I am happy to have
been freed from AA. The difference boils down to barriers to exit, and back
chat, and character assignations. Had I just left AA and read the Orange
Papers, and More Revealed, and shut up, then I suspect I would have been in
a better position. Putting my face on line was the biggest mistake I have
made since leaving the rooms.

<p>

And on a personal note I hope you are settling in to your new home. As
always, thank you for your effort and all that you have taught me. It looks
like I am going to do pretty well in my law exams and that the offers of
work will result. I would have liked to have been a part of this but when my
relapse was exposed last year, I felt I was unable to despite the fact that
I dealt with it without AA. Go figure... any wonder why it feels like we are
making so little difference? Being younger than most does not help my
credibility, but in truth it should not mean anything. I have been asked to
write a biography for someone and for the time being that is what I shall
focus on. As much as I respect your mode of academic writing, and the way
you adhere to the Harvard method of citation, I am also keen to learn from
those who simply have a view. This begs the question; what does one have to
do to have a voice in all this? There in lies the answer to why 'policy'
will never be changed. As Emerson said, &quot;*S*ociety everywhere is in
conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. The virtue in
most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not
realities and creators, but names and customs.&quot;

<p>

I noticed that you have quoted Emerson on a few occasions. Despite his
Christian outlook, I respect his view of the individual, having read all his
essays. See, one can support an individual despite his contrary views &#8212; that
is something I am unable to do with AA.

<p>

I trust you are well.

Hello again, James,
<p>
I am well, and I hope you are well too. I seem to
remember that you did well on your law exams the last time. Good.
Here's to hoping that it goes well again.
<p>
I will miss your videos, but life goes on. I'm glad someone will maintain your web site.
Thanks for all you have done.

<p>
I wouldn't call your &quot;retreat from the fray&quot; cowardly. People need to get on with their
lives. You need to do different things at different times.

Another great song was the Jefferson Airplane, &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; album,
<font color="black">
&quot;Life is change.  How it differs from the rocks.&quot;
</font>

<p>
(And yes, I do seem to love to quote things, don't I? Emerson is in good company.)

<p>
And you know, I think we are making a difference. There is just a lot of momentum to overcome.
The big system (the world) changes VERY slowly. A.A. has had a 70-year head start in promoting its
strange brand of quackery, and a lot of well-meaning but misinformed people honestly
think that A.A. is a helpful organization and a good thing. But they are learning otherwise.
<p>
Have you been following
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group">the flap over the &quot;Midtown Group&quot;
 of Washington DC, USA</a>?
There, <i><b>Newsweek</b></i> magazine, which is one of the biggest magazines
 in the USA, published a devastating
article about 'A.A. the cult that sexually exploits little girls', and
<a href="orange-letters84.html#Midtown3">the local TV station in
Washington DC has been hammering away on the issue</a>.
<p>
Now that is big.  A.A.'s facade is cracking.
Major news outlets dare to criticize and expose A.A. misconduct and sexual exploitation
of female members, which is something that I haven't ever seen before in my lifetime.
<p>
So there is hope. Things are changing.
<p>
Have a good day, and have a good life.

As you are aware my niece, Madeleine, is still missing and I am asking

everyone you know and ask them to do the same, as the story is only
being covered in Britain, Eire and Portugal. We don't believe that she
is in Portugal anymore and need to get her picture and the story
across Europe as quickly as possible. Suggestions are welcome.

Hi Andrew,
<p>
I don't mind printing that story with the picture, if it is
real rather than a hoax.

<p>

But please, I need more information. Can you get back to
the original source and get the details? The guy didn't
even give the full name of the girl. His niece, Madeleine,...
What is her last name? Who are her parents?

<p>

Can we get some contact info? Whom to tell if we see
a girl who looks like that?
<p>
What police department is handling the case?

<p>

When was she kidnapped, stolen, or disappeared? Where?

<p>

And so on.

Orange,

<p>

Madeleine McCann is a little English girl who was abducted while on
holiday
in Portugal with her parents (her whereabouts are still unknown) and the
story has been making waves across Europe. I was in Switzerland on  Monday
for a job interview and the  story was in all the media there. Obviously
it
hasn't yet made it across the pond.

<p>

Here's a tiny link to the BBC's survey of the news about her:

Andrew,
<p>
Oh, good. Lots of background information. You are right, the
story did not make it over here. I never heard a word of this
before. But I'll go ahead and put it up on the chance that some
European reader might see it.

<p>
Such a pretty little girl. I can see why someone would want to steal her.
I hope she gets home okay.
<p>

Have a good day.

Thanks for the tip, Mike.
<p>
I'm glad to see a news organization actually doing their job, just for a change.

<p>
In that article, when it came time for the token positive remarks about
 Alcoholics Anonymous, I couldn't help but notice the propaganda techniques
 used in defense of the Midtown Group:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I guess because in society each person has their own opinion about
certain things, maybe they had an experience that didn't work for them,&quot;
Linda said. &quot;Who are they to take away from people who it is working for?&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

That is classic
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism"><i>escape via relativism</i></a>
&#8212; as if it's all just a matter of one person's opinion versus another's.<br>
As if this were true,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;So what if your daughters got raped there? Mine are still okay.
 So Midtown is a good group.&quot;
</font>
<p>
And of course the speaker was just
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii">assuming facts not in evidence</a>
&#8212; &quot;it is working&quot;.<br>
Just because some girls abstained from drinking for a while does not mean
that the Midtown group is working for them.

== A very interesting discussion of the Midtown Group. Definitely read this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;There are individuals that have formed a organization, which call
themselves &quot;Love and Service&quot; (LS). They have every intention
of bringing the MG's negative influence, to light, for all of the world
to see, as well as help the MG's conditioned members receive psychological
help, as they attempt to leave the MTG.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The MG, feeling the threat of exposure, that could limit their
consumption of Newcomers, decided to fight back by setting up the Public
Relations Chair Person of LS with a false charge. The MG not only used
a woman to file false &quot;stalking / harassment&quot; charges on this
Trusted Servant, they also manipulated (pressured) more than 30 of their
impressionable Newcomers, to lie in a Court of Law, to back up said charges.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;What the MG didn't count on was that what manipulative practices
that work in AA meetings and on its broken fellowship, does not work,
by any stretch of the imagination, in a Court of Law.&quot;

Alcoholics Anonymous sure isn't cleaning its own house, in spite of all of the
high-falutin' talk about how A.A. is self-managing and self-governing.
The Midtown Group is still listed in the schedules of A.A. meetings. Look at the bottom of this page:<br>

Oh, and I have one lingering question:

that the Midtown Group

&quot;also just won the bid for SERCYPAA, South East
Region Conference of Young People in AA. So these perverts will be running a YP
conference sometime this year in DC.&quot;</font><br>
Is that still true? Is the Alcoholics Anonymous organization
going to allow a bunch of known and outed sexual
predators to run a young people's convention in Washington DC this year?<br>
Wow. A.A. really doesn't believe in cleaning house, does it?

on how to keep your group from getting taken over by the Midtown group.
It seems that Mike Q. and his gang have taken over 18 A.A. groups by invading them
in large numbers and then voting the previous leaders out, and changing the rules to
make the Mike Q. clique dominant. It sure sounds like an invasive cancer to me.

Hi again, Dennis,
<p>
Thanks for the tip.  That link is especially good because it gives the phone numbers to call:<br>
Portuguese Police: 00351 282 405 400<br>
Crimestoppers in the UK: 0800 555 111<br>
Or, if calling from Portugal: 44 1883 731 336<br>
The international # for Crimestoppers is +44 1883 731 336.

<p>
Yes, I had to ask if the Madeleine story was a hoax, because I seem to recall that a lot of those
kinds of alerts were in fact hoaxes. Which is really a sick heartless kind of hoax.
It takes some real weirdos to think that kind of stuff is funny.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Thanks for your work<br>

<p>

Hi Orange,

<p>

I just wanted to send you a quick note thanking you for the links regarding
the Midtown Group scandal. I haven't been feeling very well lately, so I
haven't been able to do as much on the Recovering from Recovery blog or
BlameDenial as I would like to, just a few post posts late at night when I
can't sleep. I had an AAer remark sarcastically to me, &quot; I bet you're loving
this stuff about Midtown, more ammunition to bash AA with.&quot; What a ludicrous
statement. First off, nothing surrounding the Midtown scandal makes me
happy; it is a sad tragedy that young people are being abused and taken
advantage of in that and other AA groups around the country. Second, I
haven't really been &quot;bashing&quot; AA lately, just pointing out how they are
bashing themselves and demonstrating the hollowness of their steps and
traditions.

<p>

As Jimmy and I have talked over the past few weeks, I've decided to take a
slightly different tack in my writing, more of an appeal to AA members to
look at their fellowship and honestly see what is wrong with it. I think
this is paying of, at least a little. I sent this blog post<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315095133/http://freedomfrom12steps.blogspot.com/2007/05/open-letter-to-members-of-alcoholics.html">
&lt;http://freedomfrom12steps.blogspot.com/2007/05/open-letter-to-members-of-alcoholics.html&gt;</a><br>

as an e-mail to about a dozen AA members in the Houston, TX area that I
know, and it has seemed to spread around the country quite rapidly. Perhaps
all of this will serve as a wake up call to the AA members who view AA as
more of a mutual support network rather than a gift from God to stand up and
demand some action and change. As I've softened my tone towards AA members a
bit, I've had some comment to me that they agree with my positions, and want
to try and change things, so hope is not lost for all of those in AA. The
more open-minded people that I know can now easily see how the reactions I
get from the die-hard religious wing are exactly the things that you and I
have written about; predictable, unthinking knee-jerk reactions, very
similar to the way a computer responds to a set of commands, but closer to
the instinctual reactions of animals defending their young.

<p>

I'm going to start a long essay for BlameDenial tonight to get the new
direction going over there. I can't tell you how much Jimmy has helped me
recently with his simple compassion and understanding. We've discussed
meeting up here in Houston sometime this year and making some videos, and I
hope we can do that soon. Slowly but surely, we're having an effect on
people in AA and the public at large. Hopefully, someday soon, all the cult
religion nonsense can be set aside and some real progress finally be made in
helping alcoholics and drug addicts.

<p>

Take care, and my best wishes to you,

<p>

Hi Eric,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and good luck on your future work.
And thanks for all that you have already done.
<p>
I have also tried to soften my stance, to not sound so shrill and strident,
but I seem to keep coming back to the conclusion that A.A. still
kills more alcoholics than it saves, which is sort of a harsh message. &nbsp; &nbsp; :-)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From: &quot;Ron R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: Paul Diener Reference To A Study Regarding The Effectiveness of One Voice in Decreasing The Effectiveness of Propaganda<br>

<p>
Hi Orange:

<p>
I've been reading one of your papers devoted to Paul Diener's responses
on the Addict-L website throughout the year 2002. Among all the
interesting information and arguments that he provided, this one
particularly caught my eye and mind. It's from
<a href="orange-Diener-postings.html#2002_12_07">a posting dating 12-7-2002</a>.
The relevant line is bolded, italicized, and underlined. The
surrounding quoted info adds the correct context in which the emphasized
line is written.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

&quot;I have never said ALL those who monitor Addict-L are corrupt. (I would
not waste time posting here if I thought this to be true.) Especially,
NON- professionals monitor this site. I spend a bit of time each week
providing a critical voice, so that the kind of bull you guys serve up
does not go without refutation.
<b><u>Research shows that even one voice of
dissent can greatly decrease the effectiveness of propaganda.</u></b>
<p>
        But I do not even claim that all the 'addiction' hacks are
CONSCIOUS evil-doers. People have a remarkable ability to do
evil deeds, yet see themselves as moral and heroic. (Even
Eichmann thought he had offered humanity a difficult, but
necessary, medical service, that he had helped eliminate a
deadly, inherited brain disorder: 'Jewish materialism').&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Do you know of which study or studies to which Diener was referring? The
emphasized line provides, I think, some hope and motivation to continue
advocacy for any cause that is just yet contrary to dominant cultural
ideologies; in this case the acceptance of 12-Steppism as the best
solution to addiction. It would be great to see those studies. Given
that Diener may be gone (as you opined elsewhere), this may be difficult
to ascertain.

<p>
I've been coming to your website for years. Thanks so much for your
commitment.

<p>
Ron R.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ron,
<p>
Thanks for the complements. Alas, I don't know what Paul was
referring to. All I can say is that he was probably right.
Every time I have checked out his references, I have found that
he was right. He had a PhD that was apparently well-earned &#8212;
he had a breath-taking sweeping view of history and the world,
which is why I like to read him.  And I have gotten a lot of
leads and hints and references from him.

<p>
And unfortunately, I don't think we can ask him. To the best of
my knowledge, he died. I heard a rumor that he was in poor health,
and then he just stopped posting and disappeared, and his
internet account was cancelled. And then I got letters from
his admirers in Europe who asked me what happened to him...

<p>
So I guess all we can do is try to track down those references
ourselves.

<p>
Have a good day.

Orange,

<p>
I saw where a Ron R. was asking about the following:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
More than likely it was from:<br>
Asch SE, &quot;Studies of Independence and Conformity: I. A Minority of One
Against a Unanimous Majority.&quot;  Psychological Monographs: General and
Applied 70(1956):1-70.
<p>
Even if it wasn't from there, Asch made the
same point and probably first.

Subject:  	music<br>

<p>

Orange,
How you doin? I'm still reading your site when I have time. This has
nothing to do with AA but that line in sgt. pepper is 20 years ago
today. And that byrds song was written by Pete Seeger.
<p>
Best Wishes, Bloozman

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hiya again, Bloozman,
<p>
You are absolutely right. I had that line about &quot;It was 40 years ago today&quot; going through my head
so much from all of the newscasters and commentators who were echoing it that my mind slipped
a cog. Yeh, the Beatles originally sang &quot;20 years ago today&quot;.
<p>
And what is both funny and frightening
is that, at that time, that seemed like an eternity. Many of us were just 20 years old ourselves,
and 20 years into the future sounded as distant as <i>&quot;Will you still need me, Will you still feed me,
when I'm 64?&quot;</i>
<p>
Well, our new sixties are here, this year, and no, Paul, the little
gold-digger won't feed you when you're 64.
<p>
I didn't know that Pete Seeger wrote &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot;.
I'm impressed. It's a very different thing from the usual folk/protest material.
<p>
It's amazing how it all just goes on and on and there's so much.
Here it is 2007 and I'm still learning stuff about the sixties (and earlier)...
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	A few remarks<br>

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
I think that a majority of those with substance abuse problems do it on
their own without a group.<br>
And, the 'recovery' industry does not know the whys and wherefores.

<p>
People who quit on their own have no reason to tell anyone how it was done.

<p>
An interesting sociological study would be to determine the charactreristics
of those who remain in AA.  It won't be done, I expect.

<p>
Midtown group does not surprise me.  I am a bit surprised that it became
public.  You are doing well on this matter.

<p>
<a name="fraught"> </a>
A flawed idea that AA is built upon:  The idea that a deeply flawed person
will cure another deeply flawed person.  A dynamic fraught with peril.

<p>
One day, competent professionals will learn that AA is a deeply flawed
organization; which only a small number of people find useful.

<p>
One day, the court system will realize that mandating AA is merely a
diversion from incarceration.  Perhaps, many in that system are aware of
that.  The cynical nature of that arrangement is manifest.

<p>
Regards,<br>
Anonymous

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the input. I couldn't agree more. I especially like the line about,
<font color="black">
&quot;The idea that a deeply flawed person will cure another deeply
flawed person.  A dynamic fraught with peril.&quot;</font>

<p>
Yes, really. Like when did any medical research ever establish that insane people
were the best counselors for other insane people? ...That the lunatics really should
run the insane asylum?

From:  	&quot;Matthew B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
I have been browsing your web-site of late and found it in all honesty rather
nauseating.

<p>
As an example, you profess that AA kills people, well, not going to AA ALSO kills
people, I haven't seen you promote that point as rigorously as you might.

<p>
As for your point regarding the nil success rate of AA and asking one e-mailer to
provide proof, well, heres proof enough. I have been a regular AA attendee for over
11 years and am now 10 years + sober. Thats success for a drunk/alcoholic of my
nature.

<p>
When I came to AA I couldnt stop drinking, and I sure as hell couldnt stop your way
(by doing it alone).

<p>
AA didnt stop me drinking, I stopped because I was afraid of living and afraid of
dying, becait was killing me and I was fortunate enoguh to at least be in an
organisation where others had also been in the same place in their lives.

<p>
Now Ive stopped, and have not taken a drink for over 10 years, so why can't I do it
your way? Because Im an alcoholic and I need to be a part of something bigger than
me that pursues the same objective as me, which is why its called a fellowship. Its
staying stopped thats the trick.

<p>
Oh and by the way, AA doesnt suggest/instruct/dictate or tell that their way is the
only way, we do not have the monopoly on recovery, although you seem to take some
kind of satisfaction from suggesting that we do.

<p>
You may choose to publish this or may choose not to, it doesnt matter; however if
you do choose to though, please dont try to manipulate my words or what you THINK
they mean, theres no hidden meaning, just let others read them and allow them the
dignity to make their own minds up.

<p>
Actually, I wish you well.

<p>
In the mean time, have a good day and a good life.

<p>
Matt

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hello Matt,
<p>
You claimed that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;not going to AA ALSO kills people&quot;</font>.
<p>
No it doesn't. You are trying to imply that A.A. makes people quit drinking and saves lives.
There is no evidence for that. The evidence is just the opposite: that A.A. makes things worse
for a lot of people.
<p>
We have been over this for so many times that I will just give you the list of
medical studies where A.A. harmed alcoholics,

<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
 A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A.
 increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
 &quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, the A.A. Trustee,
found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective, and raised the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ol>

<p>
In fact, there has never been a single valid medical study that showed that attending A.A. meetings helped
alcoholics to get better. No one. Not ever.
<p>
And you yourself just wrote that you didn't quit drinking because of Alcoholics Anonymous.
You quit drinking because you were going to die if you didn't. So did I, for the same reason,
and without Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Congratulations on your 10 years of sobriety. That does not in any way show that A.A. helped you.
It shows that you decided to quit drinking in order to save your life, and then you did it.
<p>
The fact that you didn't do it earlier is irrelevant.
You didn't quit until you really wanted to quit, until things got so bad that you just had to quit.
<p>
And your statement that you couldn't quit before is also irrelevant.
It's like saying that you when you were a child, you could never ride a bicycle
&#8212; you fell down every time you tried &#8212; until the Magic Day when you succeeded in staying up on
the bicycle. And what was the cause of that Magic Day? Some organization that says that it has a
magical spiritual cure for bicycleism?

<p>
Oh, and Bill Wilson did say that &quot;A.A. is the only way&quot;. Sure, he started off with
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">some remarks that sounded open-minded</a>,
to get people to join his cult,
but then he switched to claiming that A.A. was the only way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Any willing newcomer feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the
foundering vessel he has become.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
 page 35.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant.
His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's just one more
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html">bait-and-switch trick</a>.
Bill had so many of them.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
