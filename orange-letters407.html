Subject: 	&quot;Disease of addiction&quot; and &quot;AA success rate is 100% if you do it right&quot;<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
Thank you for your work in compiling so much information showing that AA is not the only way.

<p>
As a person who no longer chooses to use drugs or alcohol but still interacts with a number of people drinking the Kool Aid, I am often frustrated by the total refusal to engage in an objective discussion about our common problem.

<p>
As far as I can tell from my own research, the AMA voted to classify alcoholism as a disease in 1956 for insurance billing purposes.  However, the 1998 Rush Study found that only 12% of doctors consider alcoholism to be &quot;100% a disease&quot;.

<p>
Even when I was using, I have always believed drug/alcohol abuse to be a matter of choice (I enjoyed your analogy of the cost/benefit analysis).  If we as a society start classifying bad habits, moral weaknesses and outright criminal behavior as &quot;diseases&quot;, where do we draw the line?  Nail biting?  Overeating?  Pedophilia (I am powerless over children and my life has become unmanageable, etc.)?

<p>
The most common response I receive is, &quot;well yeah, but alcoholism is a disease and the cure is AA and it works 100% of the time if you work it correctly&quot;.  As we both know from Vaillant, the NIAAA and even AA's own triennial survey, the real success rate hovers around 5% after one year.  I have even met a man who works in a local treatment center who claims his success rate is &quot;81%&quot; but will offer no documentation or method of statistical analysis.  I also suspect that he has not updated his figures in over 3 years.  What do you say to someone who is convinced that AA's low success rate is due to the participant &quot;not working the program correctly&quot;?

<p>
Also, one of AA's popular slogans is &quot;the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results&quot;.  This quote is often misattributed to Albert Einstein but I cannot locate any instance of him writing or speaking such words.  If this is true, why do we see countless people trying AA over and over again until &quot;they work it right&quot;?

<p>
Lastly, do you know of any demographic surveys or any type of general census for AA participants?  I suspect that the perpetuation of the cult mentality is most likely driven by a combination of the youth and lack of education which seems to be prevalent in my local AA community.

<p>
Your thoughts would be much appreciated,<br>
Ed M.

Yes, that is one of the common identifying characteristics of a cult.
Cult members never want to objectively discuss the dogma, beliefs,
tenets, practices, and standards of the cult. They may say that they do, but
what they really want is you to agree with everything that they say.

<p>
And actually, the AMA did not call it a &quot;disease&quot; then, they only called
it an &quot;illness&quot;.

I found this statement on the AMA web site, in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005338/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1926.html" target="_blank">the history of the AMA</a>:<br>
<center>
<b>1956: AMA declares alcoholism an illness</b>
</center>
<p>
Oh, an &quot;illness&quot;, huh? Not a &quot;disease&quot;,
like the Steppers have been telling us? Those words are not the same thing.
There is a big difference there.
Food poisoning is an illness too, but it isn't contagious, or
hereditary, or incurable.
<p>
The AMA was simply responding to some very noisy A.A. lobbyists who
insisted that alcoholics were misunderstood.
And yes, they were probably after the health insurance money too.
<p>
From 1956 to 1992, the AMA had an undefined &quot;illness&quot;. They had never
said just what &quot;alcoholism&quot; was.  Finally, in 1992, they allowed a
joint committee of two A.A. front groups to write a definition of &quot;alcoholism,
the disease&quot;.  The definition is so goofy that it does not even say
that alcoholism is caused by drinking alcohol. They never said what
causes it.
Look here:
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">Two A.A. front groups wrote the AMA definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot;</a>.


<p>
And the AMA certainly did not endorse the A.A. idea that &quot;alcoholism&quot;
is a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; which only a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; will cure,
so A.A. pulls a quick sleight-of-hand trick there, and claims that
the AMA agrees with A.A. They never did. How could they? That would mean
that you should hire a priest, not a medical doctor, to cure the disease.
<p>
By the way, the AMA is not the final authority on medical issues, or
even a trustworthy organization.
The AMA is just a private club for doctors, and its main goal is to
make more money for itself and its members.
The president of the AMA who built it up into the big organization that
it is &#8212; Morris Fishbein &#8212; was busted for racketeering.
He ran a scam where pharmaceutical companies had to buy big expensive
full-page advertisements in his JAMA (Journal of the AMA) or else
he wouldn't approve of their medications.

<p>
Oh yes. Eventually, everything bad can be a disease. 
Being greedy and refusing to pay your workers a decent wage is
&quot;acquisitionitis&quot;.
Cannibalism is merely an &quot;eating disorder&quot;.
Murdering people whom you don't like, or with whom you disagree,
is &quot;hypercriticality&quot;.

<p>
&quot;It works IF you work it&quot; is a textbook example of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Lying With Qualifiers</a>

<p>
And logically, it's a meaningless statement. Vanilla ice cream also works
if you work it correctly.
So does knitting. Just always eat ice cream and knit instead of drink alcohol.
It works 100% of the time if you work it right.

<p>
Yes, that is a common treatment center trick.  They only count the
&quot;graduates&quot; because only the &quot;graduates&quot;  worked
the program &quot;correctly&quot; &#8212; meaning, that they quit
drinking and drugging. So they are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">
cherry-picking, and only counting their success stories</a>.
 The truth is, only 10% or 15% of the patients
(or not &quot;patients&quot;, but &quot;clients&quot;) at a typical
treatment center actually &quot;graduate&quot;. With that trick, they
could claim a 100% success rate, but that would sound unbelievable,
so they settle for numbers like 80%. Then they do no
follow-up surveys. How many of their success stories are still clean
and sober a year later? They never reveal that. 
You would think that for $20,000 or $40,000, you should at least
get a guarantee of a year clean and sober. But no.

<p>
Now what do you say to them? Nothing that I know of. They know what kind
of a terrible failure rate they really have, but they won't admit
that out loud.
They won't be that honest. Thus, a frank and truthful conversation is
impossible.
<p>
Now you can talk to them about counting ALL of the incoming patients,
no matter whether the patients &quot;work a strong program&quot;, but they 
don't want to hear it. Being honest like that would ruin their numbers
and spoil their advertisements.
<p>
You could tell them that the proper way to test any medication or
treatment is
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">a Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</a>,
but I know that they won't do that in order to get valid statistics.

<p>
And of course, &quot;working a strong program&quot; and &quot;doing it correctly&quot;
are just euphemisms for &quot;quit drinking&quot; and &quot;quit drugging&quot;.
So it's the same old trick of claiming the credit for the people
who quit their bad habits, while disavowing any responsibility for
those who don't. Thus the treatment program actually does nothing.
People have to quit drinking and drugging as a matter of choice
and their own will power, and then give the credit to some quacks
who charge a whole lot of money for double-talk and nonsense.

<p>
I don't know whether Einstein said it either. I know that I've seen some
quotes that attributed the saying to him, but it could be a misquote.
Once one of those misquotes gets started, it spreads like crabgrass.  
Like the misquote attributed to Sir Herbert Spencer about &quot;contempt
prior to investigation&quot;.  Spencer never said it, but it was printed
in the <i>Big Book</i>, so now many people think that he did say it.
(Look here for the whole story of that misquote:
<a href="Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf" target="_blank">
Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf</a>.)

<p>
And yes, trying A.A. again and again, and imagining that it will start
working the next time around, is insanity.

<p>
Honestly, really, how could an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties
work as a cure for a &quot;disease&quot;?

<p>
Ah, now that would be interesting. I don't know of any such surveys.
The A.A. headquarters likes to brag that all kinds of people make up
A.A. &#8212;
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#carpenter" target="_blank">
people that range from the local butcher, baker, and carpenter to doctors</a>
&#8212;
but I've never seen a real demographic survey of A.A. members.
Like you, I suspect that lack of education &#8212; and even hostile
anti-intellectualism &#8212; would be a common characteristic.
<p>
The closest thing that I know of is a study done by a trio of
psychiatrists and psychologists
who analyzed A.A. members and found that they ranged
from mildly disturbed all the way up to full-blown psychotic, and
only 10% of the A.A. members could be classified as sane and normal.
We should also consider mental illness as one of the causes of
cult mentality. Look here:
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers" target="_blank">Disturbed Followers</a>.

<p>
And while we are considering the causes of cult mentality, I'm reminded
of this quote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Wanting to believe is perhaps the most powerful dynamic initiating and sustaining 
cult-like behavior.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Wrong Way Home: Uncovering the Patterns of Cult Behavior in
American Society</i>,

</blockquote>
<p>
That leads into all of the various reasons why people join cults and
insist on believing in cults, ranging from buying a guaranteed ticket
to Heaven, to fear of death or madness, to enjoying being part of the
in-crowd, to enjoying the fantasy that they are doing something great,
and much more.  We discussed all of that several times before. Look at:

That is one productive mother. She has reason to be proud.

The mother is in the lead, and the father is near the middle of the flock.
He's the tallest one. Look closely at the goslings. The first and last
goslings are much bigger than the others, and much older, and have all
of their feathers, and adult coloration. My best guess for what is going
on there is that the two large goslings are the surviving children from
last year, and the 11 smaller goslings are the children from this year.
Canada Geese goslings prefer to stay with their parents for two years,
so that makes sense. Also note how the older children take the lead and
tail positions, to surround and protect the younger ones. The older
children routinely help to raise their younger siblings.

Baby Fish, almost certainly baby Carp, eating bread.
</center>
The baby carp are enthusiastically eating the bread.
<a href="orange-letters351.html#Meatbag" target="_blank">Earlier, we were
discussing the merits of feeding the wildlife</a>,
and someone who was against it complained that old bread will
just sink to the bottom of the pond
and rot and poison the water. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The only place that could happen is in a dead, stagnant pond that is
devoid of life.  Here, the baby fish will eat all of the left-over bread.
That may seem unlikely, until you see that there are <i>thousands</i> of
those baby fish. The shore is crawling with them.
Just one female carp makes hundreds of eggs, which hatch out to
hungry little fry.
They fasten their jaws on the bread, and then twist their bodies with
a strong flip of their tails, and rip off a mouthful of the bread.
And then they do it again, and again. Thousands of them do it.
In 24 hours, that bread will be gone &#8212; if a duck or goose or
other bird doesn't get it sooner.
A simple fact of life out in nature is that free food doesn't sit
around for very long. Something comes along and finds it and eats it.
<p>
UPDATE: 2014.07.17: An interesting web site called &quot;arkive.org&quot; reports that a single
female carp can lay <i>millions</i> of eggs in a single breeding season.
[<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005338/http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arkive.org%2Fcommon-carp%2Fcyprinus-carpio%2Fvideo-ca09a.html&amp;ei=GVLIU4izC8XZoATQ3YHQDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIVVWRhC2RuCmqXRrEOcuqqJGZug&amp;sig2=mfExc9XBL7Zcgqimu7ENNw&amp;bvm=bv.71198958,d.cGU" target="_blank">Link Here</a>.]
So saying that a female carp can make hundreds of eggs is a gross underestimate,
and saying that there are thousands of baby fish is not an exaggeration at all.
Rather, it's way too low.
So there are hundreds of thousands, or even millions of those little baby fish,
all hungry for that bread. Needless to say, it gets eaten before it can rot.
<p>
Likewise, Wikipedia reports
[<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005338/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carp" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carp</a>]
&quot;a typical adult female can lay 300,000 eggs in a single spawn.&quot;
Wow. Now that's a bunch of kids.

Loved your article. I've been destined to fail at staying sober since I quit going to meetings. I found the opposite to be true. I'm calmer, saner and living in the world as a &quot;normie&quot;. I'm not obsessed with being weak and one drink away from a drunk. I just don't drink. I laughed all through your words and found many so sad.

Hello Lisa,

Subject: 	Thought you may enjoy this essay destroying Astrology<br>

<p>
<center>
<h2> Why Astrology is fake in 20 sentences!</h2>
</center>
<p>
The gravity that affects biological life (fish migrations, ocean tides) comes from different sources. The big 4 planets have less than 1% influence on us and their combined nodal cycle is hundreds of years long so there isn't a mentionable, cyclical influence. In short, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus have a negligible effect on Earths life! They are too far away and their gravity does not affect us, period! Read a scientific journal.
<p>
The Moon is the only significant celestial gravitational source. Gravity affection from above is approximately 80% lunar, 20% solar, and a tiny portion, jovial planets.<br>
**The Moon is the only culprit who could potentially cause prenatal character development patterns that would resemble something loosely similar to astrology.<br>
** For the Moon to cause the personality and emotional differences we would have to find indisputable correlations between its fluctuating gravitational influence and human behavior/personality. Contrary to people's ignorance and wishful thinking, no notable correlations have been found.

<p>
To find correlational data we have two difficult tasks. One is to perfectly graph chronologically and geographically, the Moon's fluctuating gravitational influence and the other is to do a 40 year, double blind, unethical and impeccable study of thousands of pregnant women and their children, on every latitude, longitude and elevation. The second will never happen unless someone finds remarkable correlational data and publishes it. Good luck convincing respected neuroscientists, pediatricians and astrophysicists that lunar gravity influences prenatal, neurological personality development in a detectable and harvestable way. The first task, to graph lunar influence, sounds reasonable, but it's a dead end too.

<p>
The lunar apogee and perigee (distance), its revolution, and its nodal cycle (18.61 years) make any correlation pointless. The Moon also has fluctuating gravity of its own according to region. The amusing zodiac charts (western and eastern) are not divisible into an 18.61 year timeframe. A cyclical, lunar gravity graph will never correlate to human neurology. Why?<br>
 **Because it would be an 18 year, 8 month, 15 day long 'zodiac' with sporadically fluctuating gravity influence and extreme geographic prejudice. Tracking its influence in humans would be a daunting task for people with 30 times our current technology and the data would suggest no less than millions of different 'star signs.<br>
** We can't even surmise wind and weather patterns with perfect accuracy, good luck predicting how a brain with 150 trillion synapses will behave. A lunar gravity pattern of influence exists, but securing it to human personality is ridiculous, far-fetched, and insulting to our complex anatomy. There isn't a chart that can tell us who we'll love, how we'll behave, or when we'll face challenges. Our precarious moon isn't a reliable subject for a graph. It's always going out, coming in, spinning and nutating. The notion that 13 constellations, a handful of planets and the Moon's location dictates human sociology is deeply erroneous, a source of social prejudice and only rivaled in fantasy by the current world religions.

Hey guess what I am still sober!   Wait I forgot AA does not work.  Better run down to the bar.  :)  Just poking a little fun on your article.  I was reading it again and I still stand on you have so much talent but choose to write so negative about a movement that has saved millions of lives.  AA has killed no one.  It is a simple program I have never met anyone too stupid for the program but people like you (smart in a good way I mean it) make it harder than it is.

Sober and Happy In Columbus<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Patrick,
<p>
Thanks for the response. Congratulations for getting your life together
and staying sober. I'm genuinely happy to hear that you are doing well,
and keeping yourself sober.
But of course your sobriety doesn't prove anything
about A.A. working.
<p>
It's like, suppose somebody joined Scientology and then spent all
of his spare time at the Scientology Center
holding two tin cans that are connected to a meter, and confessing all
of his sins to his Case Supervisor (C/S), and also telling his C/S
about every injury that he ever suffered.
Then he wrote to me and bragged that he was still sober, so that proves
that Scientology really works.
<p>
No it doesn't. Scientology is just another
fraudulent cure for whatever ails you, just like Alcoholics Anonymous.
If a Scientologist is sober, it's because he is controlling his own
behavior and not drinking alcohol. And the same thing applies to A.A.
members too.
<p>
By the way, both William Griffith Wilson and Lafayette Ronald Hubbard were
certified lunatics (their psychiatrists said so), and they both
imagined that they had invented a great new cure that nobody else
was intelligent enough to see, and they both founded cults that
maintain that they have the only cure for a human problem.

<p>
A.A. is not harmless and it has harmed a great many people. Have you read
the <a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">A.A. Horror Stories</a>
yet?
<p>
And also see the
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">A.A. Suicides</a>
and the
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">A.A. &quot;No Meds&quot; Horror Stories</a>.

<p>
And A.A. has not saved millions of lives. In fact, A.A. has killed more
people than it has saved.
A.A. merely steals the credit for the few people who, like you, quit drinking
and stay quit by using their own will power and determination.
<br>
Look here:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial</a>

<p>
And A.A. refuses to take any blame for the millions of people who are
hurt more than helped by A.A., and who suffer and die.  That is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">Observational Selection</a>,
which is a common propaganda trick where a conman only counts the hits
and ignores the misses.

<p>
The slogan about &quot;Nobody is too stupid to get the A.A. program, but
some are too intelligent,&quot; is actually very revealing. You have
to be a &quot;low-information voter&quot; to believe in the ravings of
the lunatic William Griffith Wilson.
<p>
But then again, you also have to be a &quot;low-information voter&quot;
to believe in the ravings of Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of
Scientology, so you are in good company.

<p>
Have a good day now.

I am sitting in am aa meeting right now my home group anniversary there are over 120 people in the room more than 40 percent have 10 plus years we just did a count down.  Another 30 percent had over 5 and yes 30 had less than 1 year.  Yes people have died that I knew in the program.   Your premise of true alcoholics  are better without aa is laughable.  Your stats continue to skew the truth.  Yes people die in aa there are tracked so people like you can track them.

  You are better without aa is laughable.  When alcoholics don't get treatment within aa or another program based treatment that outlines a better way of living will not recover.

 The true alcoholics that don't pursue treatment die you just don't count them in your stats.  How many kill themselves from depression caused by alcoholism?  How many car accidents and people die?  How many unintentional drug over doses?  Over eating? Obesity? The list of things true alcoholics die from is end less they are just listed under something else.  How people have you heard that have died when they say they just lost the will to live!  Many many of these are people that died from untreated alcoholism.  Where are there people in your studies?

One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor and medical Doctor George E. Vaillant of Harvard University, who was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless  &#8212;  that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested  &#8212;  a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as &quot;appalling&quot;. While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
<p>
* (Nevertheless, Vaillant still became a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to &quot;get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer.&quot; That is cult religion, not a treatment.<br>

Hello again, Patrick,
<p>
I'm not skewing the numbers, you are. You are again engaging in
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">Observational Selection</a>.
You have not counted all of the failures who are not there at
your meeting. You didn't count a single suicide who is now in the
ground, rather than at your A.A. meeting.
You didn't count a single relapser who took the &quot;powerless&quot; doctrine
literally and drank alcohol uncontrollably.
You didn't count a single one of the people who stopped taking her medications
on the instructions of her sponsor and ended up in a mental hospital, or dead.
You are only looking at the survivors of the cult.

What you are describing is a filter.  Only those few sober people remain out
of the thousands of people who came and went in the last 10 or 20 years.
You are only seeing one side of the picture.  On the other side are the
missing A.A. failures.
You never went to the meeting at the graveyard to count all of the A.A.
failures, did you?
<p>
By the way, a group that has that high of a percentage of old-timers
is very unusual. Where are all of the newcomers? Where is the next
generation of A.A.?
Apparently, A.A. is shrinking down to a museum of old-timers.

<p>
Who tracks the people who die in A.A.? Nobody that I know of. Please show
me the records. I want to see all of the numbers.
The A.A. headquarters most assuredly does not track A.A. fatalities,

One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was

People who die from obesity are not dying from &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
Unintentional drug overdoses are not caused by &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
People losing their will to live is not alcoholism.

And people who are depressed often turn to alcohol to try to fix the

That was Bill Wilson's problem &#8212; he was a chronic depressive even
before he took a single drink. He suffered a year-long bout of depression
when he was just a child, when his mother left him with his grandparents.
Bill's first 3-year-long bout of clinical depression was while he was
still in high school, when his girlfriend Bertha Bamford died, which caused
him to flunk out and not graduate from high school.  Long periods of
clinical depression were a recurring feature of Bill's life.  The worst
was an 11-year-long period from 1944 to 1955, while Bill was allegedly sober.
<p>
&quot;Alcoholism&quot; is not a catch-all ailment that causes all other
medical conditions. Often, it's just a complicating factor where people
self-medicate with alcohol, vainly trying to fix what is broken.

<p>
And what you call &quot;true alcoholics&quot; do not die from lack of A.A. or
treatment. As I just showed you, most of the successful recoveries
happen without any A.A. or any treatment.
<p>
And yes, people do count all of the alcohol fatalities. The government
is constantly supplying us with numbers. And I have reported many, many
times that the annual death toll from alcohol &#8212; just in the USA &#8212;
is over 100,000 per year, plus another 13,000 from automobile accidents.
And the death toll from tobacco, which Bill Wilson said is okay,
is 430,000 per year.  On the other hand, the death toll from marijuana
is near zero. People are counting everything.

<p> 
Then you quoted me describing Dr. George Vaillant's Project CASPAR results,
and asked, where are the people in Vaillant's studies? You mean now?
Probably somewhere around Boston. How should I know? I'm in Oregon.
Ask George Vaillant. As a true believer member of Alcoholics Anonymous,
and a former member of the Board of Trustees of A.A.,
I'm sure that he will be happy to tell you all about it.
You can contact him through Harvard University. Write to Prof. George E.
Vaillant, c/o the Psychiatry Department.

<p>
And you can try reading his book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i>. You have apparently 
already seen my analysis of his book, here:<br> 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a>
<p>
Please read it again, and again, until you understand what Dr. Vaillant was
saying about A.A. treatment:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but
our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	Back to the Old Testament<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
It has been a while and I see you have published my ramble on the old testament, just to clarify a couple points you picked up &#8212; 

<p>
My analysis of some parts of the ot are quite standard biblical scholarship,  being &quot;the documentary hypothesis&quot;, which is simply that the ot was written over hundreds of years by a multitude of different authors and schools of thought, these are:

<p>
1. The Yahwists, who refer to God as &quot;yhw&quot;;<br>
2. The Elohists, who refer to God as &quot;ellohim&quot;;<br>
3. The Preistly writers; these are the &quot;p&quot; or &quot;d&quot; source (Deuteronomic).<br>

<p>
At one point Ellohim and Yahweh would have been separate cults and merged fully only around 600bce, in captivity in Babylon. The first five books of the ot have fairly late authorship and (look at all those rules!) indicate a settled people with a rather involved cult of worship.

<p>
Under the documentary hypothesis, the OT was compiled in babylon from obviously older sources &#8212; around 600bce.

<p>
So, the OT is not fiction, it just can't easily be read as history since it is compiled long after many of the events and there is so much drift (and each tribe is telling slightly different stories &#8212; that is why Goliath is killed by two different people: each tribe claims the kill).

<p>
Anyway, the ancient Hebrews would not have had a very fixed idea of history &#8212; these are the stories of the tribes and all. They do care about meaning.

<p>
Job is considered the oldest book because the literary structure is so primative, because it resembles other wisdom liturature of deeper antiquity and because the cosmology is God vs the Dragon, which is an older cosmology than genesis.

<p>
I occasionally like to break out actual biblical religion in AA meetings, always to debunk the 12 steps (which my rabbi regards as &#8212; harmless, ok, questionable,  apostasy). Oh, how they hate that. I like to begin &quot;I had my rabbi review the 12 steps (and they get mushy in anticipation); he judged it pagan worship. Haha.

<p>
It is a great conceit of Bill W's that christian-ish Oxfordism is a new, universal religion suitable for all. For God's sake; it is not even Christianity.

<p>
Yeah, you get to name your own God (which is apostasy for me!) but what of it? Bill W. has defined the attributes of God. A sort of saving God that does stuff for you. I rather stay sober in my own religious tradition. I hate the imperial reach of AA, and most any sane Jew sees it as a Protestant-lite tent meeting from jump.

<p>
Plus, Bill is a necromancer and we ought to stone him to death.

<p>
I do not make many meetings these days. The passive-agressive thrill is not worth the tedium.

<p>
Cheers,

<p>
Ilr

Hello Ian,
<p>
Thanks for the history lesson, and the laugh. I can just picture
the A.A. members drooling in anticipation of what your Rabbi would say
about the 12 Steps: &quot;Yes, the 12 Steps are completely compatible with
Talmudic teachings.&quot; <i>NOT!</i>
Pagan worship, huh? That sounds about right.
<p>
And stoning Bill Wilson to death for all of the millions of people whom
he has hurt sounds too kind.

<p>
Calling the A.A. God &quot;a saving God&quot; really sounds like an
understatement.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Santa_Claus" target="_blank">
The A.A. God is Santa Claus</a>.
He will give you a new car, and a new wife, and a new job, and money,
and a better apartment, and everything:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

happened to me since I have been in A.A. &#8212; they came to me
from a Greater Power.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
<i>Rum, Radio, and Rebellion</i>, page 367.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I've heard a lot of such talk in A.A. meetings, how &quot;Higher Power&quot;
gave her this, and that, and arranged things so that she would benefit.
I even had a guy who was trying to recruit me as his sponsee
telling me that it was wonderful that God had arranged things so
that I was so poor and down and out that I was eating out of
Dempsey Dumpsters.
(The idea being that such poverty kept me from drinking too much.)
<p>
By the way, your history of the Old Testament reminded me of a lecture
on the orgins of the Gospels that my friend &quot;Dewisant&quot; messaged to me one day:
<p> 
<center><table width="93%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<br>There are two theories.  The two-source and the four-source theories.
<br>Two Source is the view that Matthew and Luke made use of two written sources - Mark and the &quot;Sayings Gospel Q&quot; - in composing their gospels.
<br>
<br>Four Source is a common explanation of the relationships found in the Synoptic Gospels (MMLJ).  Matthew used Mark, Q, and his own special source called M.  Luke also used Mark and Q, but had another source called L, that Matthew did not have.  The material in M and L probably comes from oral tradition.
<br>Further:
<br>
<br>(Correction.  The Synoptic Gospels are MML)
<br>
<br>Agreement between Matthew and Luke begins where Mark begins and ends where Mark ends.
<br>
<br>Matthew reproduces about 90% of Mark, Luke about 50%.  They often reproduce Mark in the same order.  When they disagree, either Matthew or Luke supports the sequence in Mark.
<br>
<br>In segments the three have in common, verbal agreement averages about 50%.  (Further proof in the book, and I ain't typing that much.  I can show it to you on Sunday, ironically.)
<br>
<br>Said segments are called &quot;The Triple Tradition&quot;..  In those segments in common, Matthew and Mark often agree against Luke, and Luke and Mark often against Matthew, but Matthew and Luke rarely agree against Mark.
<br>
<br>Mark is responsible for the chronological outline of the life of Jesus represented by the Synoptics; Matthew and Luke do NOT have independant evidence for the order of events.
<br>
<br>Mark is the earliest of the three.
<br>
<br>
<br>I also have a timeline, if you want. I can give you a rough one for order of first appearance and earliest remaining traces.
<br>
<br>Did you get all that?  *LOL*
<br>
<br>1 - 30 CE:
<br>John the Baptist, the precursor and mentor of Jesus (died about 27CE)
<br>Jesus of Nazareth, &quot;traveling sage and wonder-worker&quot; [ed. - my quotes, their words] (died about 30CE) {ed. - Date is actually highly questionable, given current research, but I didn't write it.]
<br>30 - 60 CE:
<br>Paul of Tarsus, chief founder of gentile Christianity (letters written about 50 - 60CE)
<br>Sayings Gospel Q (first edition, about 50CE)
<br>Gospel of Thomas (first edition, about 50CE)
<br>60 - 80 CE:
<br>Signs Gospel (eventually incorporated into John)
<br>Gospel of Mark, the first narrative gospel (first edition, about 70CE)
<br>Didache, first believer's handbook (first edition) [ed. - And actually, damned interesting, too!]
<br>
<br>80 - 100 CE:
<br>Gospel of matthew, incorporating Mark and Q (about 80CE)
<br>Gospel of Luke, incorporating Mark and Q (about 90CE)
<br>Dialogue of the Savior (first edition, probably 50 - 100CE)
<br>Gospel of Peter (first edition, probably about 50 - 100CE)
<br>Egerton Gospel (probably 50 - 100CE)
<br>Gospel of John, incorporating the Signs Gospel (about 90CE)
<br>Gospel of Mark, canonical edition (about 100CE)
<br>100 - 150 CE:
<br>Gospel of John, third edition (insertions and additions)
<br>
<br>Secret Book of James, first edition (found at Nag Hammadi)
<br>Gospel of Mary (found at Nag Hammadi)
<br>Jewish-Christian Gospels (preserved in patristic quotations)
<br>Didache, second edition (insertions and additions)
<br>Gospel of Thomas, second edition (surviving edition)
<br>
<br>Surviving fragment of Gospel of John (P52)
<br>Surviving fragments of Egerton Gospel (PEgerton2 and PK&ouml;ln255)
<br>150 - 325 CE:
<br>Emergence of four &quot;recognized&quot; gospels
<br>Emergence of an official collection of Christian writtings (&quot;New Testament&quot;)
<br>Christianity becomes a legal religion (313CE)
<br>Coucil of Nicea (325CE)
<br>First official creeds
<br>First surviving copies of &quot;Bibles&quot; (about 325-350CE)
<br>{ed. - DONE!  Whew!!}
<br>
<br>I need a cigarette, after that.  And think my WPM for typing just went up a few points.  *LOL*
<br>
<br>Couple of notes.  The 'o' in PK&ouml;ln255 has an umlaut.  Also, on the manuscript numbers, P52, PEgerton2 and PK&ouml;ln255, the numbers are always in superscript.
<br>Got all that.  *ROFL*
<br>
<br>You now know more about Christianity than most American Christians.  You are now, officially exempt from EVER having to go to church, ever again.  :-P

<p>
Further to that &#8212; 

<p>
I notice when you talk about Moses and the ot you make a typical error.

<p>
The 614 commandments (of which stoning necromancers and bashing your enemies heads are top picks) are only binding on the children of Israel: gentiles are not expected to follow Mosaic Law).

<p>
Gentiles get by on the much less rigorous 7 commandments to Noah &#8212; the Noahide Laws.

<p>
When people seek to fuss with religion they tend to pick the dumbest things in the ot and combine them with the dumbest of the nt.

<p>
They thence ask you &quot;am I going to hell because I eat shellfish?&quot;.

<p>
No. The dietary laws are only binding on Jews and you can read the ot 1mn times and you will discover there is no mention of hell. Jews do not beleive in hell.

<p>
