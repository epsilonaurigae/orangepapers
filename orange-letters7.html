Hello Orange,
<p>
I like your site. I was in AA and Al-anon in the
1980's. Got what I needed out of both groups, and
drifted away. 
<p>

After reading about the 24 hour concept of AA and how
God delivers you from drinking, I thought of the New
Testament, when Christ made the blind see and lame
beggars walk. If God as Christ could and did do those
things, then why not remove a disease of drinking
permanently? I do agree that AA's presentation of God
and His Works is awful. Truly awful.
<p>

One thing bothers me though. Which was B. Wilson &#8212; a
lazy parasite or a severely depressed man? Depression
does present itself as laziness. Was he a lazy
parasite when he wasn't depressed? Or was he always
depressed? 
<p>

One question for you &#8212; what drove you to be so
passionate about AA? I am just curious because I know
how much work is involved in writing pages and coding
web pages. I did read the intro. Was it what you saw
happening in AA?
<p>

I have enjoyed reading your pages. I did like the
pages on critical thinking aka propaganda of AA. 
Critical thinking is crucial for understanding and for
discernment.

Hi Snorks,<br>
Thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
The short and sweet answer about "why?" is indeed in
<a href="orange-intro.html">the intro</a>.
That's 100% autobiographical. So is the routine about
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">A.A. "treatment"</a>
at the end of the Bait-And-Switch web page.
<p>
Beyond that, it's just the frustration of seeing friends
get sold a bill of goods, rather than something that helps
or works.
<p>

As far as the question of Bill being lazy, or depressed, or
both, I don't know if I can really split the two out of
his behavior and figure out just how much was due to each.
And you are right about the two looking similar, so that it's
easy to confuse one for the other. And then I would add
the cigarette smoking. It robs all of your energy and makes
you less physically active, too. And Bill was such a heavy
chain smoker that he died of it. That's definitely the biggest
slow-down.
<p>

Well, have a good day.

[letter 2 from Snorks:]
<p>

Hi Orange,<br>
Thanks for your reply.
<p>

I can understand about your frustration about AA being
one thing and turning out to be something else all
together. Too bad you can't report it to your local
consumer fraud center. 
<p>

My experience with AA was "don't ask, don't tell". I
have a mental illness, so as long as I didn't talk
about it, I was fine. 
<p>

I went to a non-traditional AA meeting. We met at
lunchtime in a government building. We used one of
their conference rooms. Since it was at lunch, there
was no meeting after the meeting. Since it was a
conference room, there were no pictures, no slogans
posted, and no literature. What there was, was when
someone brought some. 
<p>

In the twelve years I was in AA, I DID NOT own a Big
Book or the 12x12. I didn't have a sponsor either. 
Basically, everyone assumed that everyone else went to
evening meetings. They used the lunch group as a back
up to the real deal &#8212; the evening meeting. I also
never went to an evening meeting. Since they never
asked about my program, I never told them about my
lack of program.
<p>

Since I was a double winner, I went to Al-anon as
well. But Al-anon wasn't set up to handle someone
like me nor the three men in the group. I have a
brother who drinks too much. Two men had wives. One
man had a daughter. We also had one woman with a son.
 Al-anon was really meant for wives of alcoholics. No
more and no less. I guess the rest of us had to go
some place else.
<p>

My knowledge came from the pamphlets that I glommed
onto and some Al-anon books. I also took notes at the
meetings. That's how I learned the steps.
<p>

Why I left &#8212; intolerance of mental illness. As long
as I remained silent, and left most of the program, I
was fine. But there were those slogans: "My best
thinking got me here." My best thinking did get me
there since I was seeking treatment for my mental
illness. AA was suggested as a place to go to augment
my treatment. (Not by my doctor though. He was
neutral.)
<p>

"No one ever died from feelings." I lost one friend
and one relative to untreated depression. They killed
themselves when their feelings overwhelmed them.
<p>

"You're right where you're supposed to be." I am
supposed to be sane. I am supposed to be in treatment
working on getting sane. I am not supposed to be in a
room with other people telling me NOT to take my meds.
<p>

Then there was the discussion of the evils of anger. 
Anger is good. Focused anger is what people use to
get better. You need it for fuel over the hard places
to getting better. 
<p>

What is cunning and baffling is mental illness. That
is the real deal. All this talk of sanity and
insanity over drinking is stupid. Few people in the
meetings understand what those terms really
meant. I believe in God who restored me to sanity. 
He did it by inspiring people to be doctors to treat
others. He did it by inspiring people to look for a
cure. He did it when people discovered some drugs did
help people become sane. I do not believe that a
12-step program is a cure for mental illness, which is
a disease of the brain.
<p>

But I do believe as you do, B. Wilson had a mental
illness or at least a disease of the brain. I also
believe that the Big Book needs to be updated. After
all treatment for people has progressed from the dark
days of the 1930's. Then you drank, got religion,
went to the nut house, and got electro-shock therapy.
<p>

Today, we have more choices and more humane ways to
become well.
<p>

Sorry about writing so much. I came upon your site
when I was researching cults. I always thought AA was
a type of a cult.
<p>

Take care,<br>
Snorks

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Snorks,
<p>
Hey, don't apologize for writing so much. It's great. I love it.
You make more sense, as a supposedly insane person, than a lot of
the allegedly sane people that I have to deal with.<br>
(Look
<a href="orange-letters7.html#pitch">
two letters down</a> for a sterling example of sanity...)
<p>
Congratulations on your recovery, and
definitely have a good day.

Dear Agent Orange,
<p>

I am a 4th year Social Work student in Canada. I have to complete a 4 month 
practicum placement in a local agency, and, by choice, I chose a 12 step 
treatment program (of course, this was partially due to the complete lack of 
choice!)
<p>

So, here I am.... only 1 week in and I am going nuts! I feel like they are 
wanting to convert me, and see that I &quot;come to believe&quot;. I am wanting to 
help the clients in recovery, but fear that if I offer alternatives for 
them, I will sabotage their time there.. and afterall.. I am only a student.
<p>

I am questioning whether or not I can truly learn an skills there, apart 
from being able to critically evaluate the program from the inside.
Your papers are giving me the support I need right now,
<p>

Thank you,<br>
Joan

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi Joan,<br>
Thanks for the compliments. Glad to hear that somebody gets
something out of all of those pages occasionally.
<p>
And I really know how you feel about them wanting to convert
you and make you come to believe. That's one of the things
that they did to me that made me write all of the Orange Papers.
And the thing that is really maddening is when they deny it
and say that they aren't trying to make you believe anything.
<p>

I too feel really funny about campaigning against A.A..
They repeat
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">the Big Lie</a> about how it helps so many people
so much that you start to believe that maybe at least a few
people benefit from it, so if a friend is getting indoctrinated
into believing all of the standard dogma, like the disease
theory, and spiritual diseases, and a spiritual experience
being the cure, am I really doing him a favor by telling him
the truth, contradicting all of that stuff?
Would I hurt him by taking away his &quot;support system&quot;?
<p>

That seems to be part of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">the strategy</a>:
&quot;Don't complain about
us brainwashing people into our religious cult unless you
have a program that works better. Our religion that we won't
call a religion has saved millions of lives.&quot;
<p>

That's where I have to just fall back on the numbers in
the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">the Effectiveness of 12-Step Treatment</a>, and
remember that A.A.'s score on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">rigorously controlled tests</a>
seems to always be zero...
<p>

Thanks for the letter. Have a good day.

<a name="Lincoln"> </a>
[second letter from Pitch Black, 20 January 2003:]
<p>

<p>

I skimmed your &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; section  There is no evidence that 
Lincoln ever said that line about sending the other generals a case of 
whatever Grant drank. But, he certainly never said anything about them 
&quot;getting off their asses.&quot;

<p><font color="blue">
You really should know better than to try to prove a negative. Did you live
with President Lincoln in the White House during the Civil War years, and monitor every
conversation Lincoln ever had during those years?
If not, then how can you be sure that Lincoln never said something?
He might have spoken while you were out of the room.

<p>
But before we go any further, you have dodged the question I asked you in the
last letter:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
Why do you applaud and cheer for people getting two-month coins at A.A. meetings,
but sneer at two years of sobriety achieved outside of A.A.?<br>
</font>
Please answer that question.
<p>
<a name="General_Grant"> </a>
Now, back to Lincoln. This is Carl Sandburg, quoting Lincoln in his famous biography of
Lincoln. President Lincoln is speaking to John M. Thayer, a brigadier from Grant's army:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;One day a delegation headed by a distinguished doctor of divinity from New York,
called on me and made the familiar complaint and protest against Grant being retained
in his command. After the clergyman had concluded his remarks, I asked if any others
desired to add anything to what had already been said. They replied that they did not.
Then looking as serious as I could, I said:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;'Doctor, can you tell me where General Grant gets his liquor?'&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;'The doctor seemed quite nonplussed, but replied that he could not. I then said to
him:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;'I am very sorry, for if you could tell me I would direct the Chief Quartermaster
of the army to lay in a large stock of the same kind of liquor, and would also direct
him to furnish a supply to some of my other generals who have never yet won a victory.'&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lincoln handed Thayer a friendly slap on the leg, lay back in his chair, had a laugh,
and resumed:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;What I want and what the people want is Generals who will fight battles and win
victories. Grant has done this and I propose to stand by him. I permitted this incident
to get into print, and I have been troubled no more with delegations protesting against
Grant. Somehow or other I have always felt a leaning toward Grant. Ever since he sent
that message to Buckner, 'No terms but unconditional surrender,' I have felt that he was
a man I could tie to, though I have never seen him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, noted that when overzealous people had accused Grant
of intemperance, Lincoln's reply was, &quot;If I knew what brand of whiskey he drinks
I would send a barrel or so to some other generals.&quot;
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Abraham Lincoln, The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg, Volume II, page 120.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Now we can still quibble over the &quot;get off of their asses&quot; phrase...
I forget where I heard that. I shall search further tomorrow.
</font><p>

<a name="resentment"> </a>
Later on, while engaging in your own Ad Hominen 
attack against Bill W. (I spelled that right, didin't I? I mean, I notice 
in your mail that the first thing you always do with your unfriendly 
correspondents is accuse them of an Ad Hominen attack) you mention that he 
wrote the Big Book during a bout of severe depression. This is untrue, as 
you point out in another section of your self-indulgent website. Bill's 
depression dated from after 1940, and was caused, again, according to your 
twisted logic, by his guilt over killing his best friend, Hank.

<p><font color="blue">
Quite wrong. Please <i>actually read</i> what you are criticizing,
rather than just &quot;skim&quot; it (as you called it) and
then go off half-cocked with your head full of misimpressions.
I said that Bill's second book, <i>&quot;Twelve Steps
and Twelve Traditions&quot;</i>, was written in the middle of his 11-year bout of deep,
crippling clinical depression. <i>&quot;12x12&quot;</i>
was written around 1950 to 1951, and published
in 1952. That was right in the middle of Bill's depression.

<p>
You also misunderstand the nature of <i>Ad Hominem</i>. It is not just criticizing
someone. It is attacking a person, <i><b>rather than</b></i> attacking his statements.
It is attacking someone personally because you cannot argue with or refute his
statements.
<i>Ad Hominem</i> is: When he has the facts on his side, you attack
his appearance, or his manner of speaking, or his taste in music,
or some other irrelevant detail of his person. (And perhaps throw in a little
name-calling, too.)
<p>
<a name="resentment2"> </a>
For example, in your next paragraph, just below,
you accuse me of having a resentment. That is a common stepper stunt.
That is an <i>Ad Hominem</i> attack.
Steppers have
this strange idea that anyone who feels a resentment is automatically wrong. Nothing
else need be said, and you don't need to pay any attention to what he actually says.
If he has a resentment, that makes him automatically always wrong in the minds of steppers.
That is probably because Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Resentment is the number one offender. It destroys more
alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual
disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill,
we have been spiritually sick.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 5,
<i>How It Works</i>, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But with the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth
of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is
infinitely grave.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 66.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
The truth is, whether someone has a resentment, or is angry, has
nothing to do with whether his statements are actually true.
Whether I am happy or unhappy, or resentful or cheerful, has absolutely
nothing to do with whether Bill Wilson was a lying fraud.
<p>

<p>
[third letter from Pitch Black, 20 January 2003:]
<p>

Dear Orange-pulp:
<p>

Regarding, &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot;
<p>

Now, let's get this one straight. It's ok for a guy to command the Army of 
the Potomac and be a drunk, but it's a scandal for a depressvie to write a 
book?. Can't follow my logic? That's because I'm extrapolating from your 
zany website. As part of your Ad Hominen attack on Bill W., you imply that 
the big book is a monstrosity partly because it is written by a man in a 
depression. Wow, what a slam at all your readers/supporters who happen to be 
depressed. I guess a depressed person is incapable of doing anything useful. 
 I think you owe all your depressed readers an apology.  But, let's leave 
that alone for a minute, and think about General Grant. Are you so certain 
that he was a great general? I can only imagine how you'd rip him apart if 
he were the topic of your hateful website, rather than Bill W. Let's not 
forget Cold Harbor, shall we? How many men slaughtered? 7,000 in about 15 
minutes, wasn't it? &quot;Grant, the Butcher&quot;, they called him. If you ever 
decide to uncover the truth about the Civil War, instead of just going over 
and over the same ground on AA, just think of how many millions of pages you 
could write. Here, let me get you started: (I shall use quotations, to put 
words in your mouth, even though you never said this. It is a propaganda 
trick you often use.) &quot;Grant, after a lifetime of failure, manages through 
bribery and murder to get appointed commander of the Army of the Ohio. He 
nearly loses the war thanks to his bungling at Shiloh, then takes more than a 
year to conquer Vicksburg. All during this time, he was actually in 
communication with the Senate plotting to have Lincoln assassinated so he 
could take over. After manipulating his way to the top, he drags the war out 
through all of 1864 and much of 65, so that he can get his assassin, JW Booth 
into position for the kill. After the War, he spearheads the impeachment of 
Andrew Johnson, and takes over soon after. His administration occupies a 
singular place in American history for malfeasance and corruption. And in a 
final slam at truth, honor and dignity, Grant buys off his biographers, and 
is held blameless.&quot;   Well, that's all for now. I leave it to you to fill 
in all the nasty details. You do it so well.

<p><font color="blue">

Well Pitch, that is one mighty fine conspiracy theory you have there.
Now all you need to do is find some actual evidence to support your theory.
Do you perhaps have a book written (or co-written)
by Ulysses S. Grant that describes in detail how he is planning to assassinate Lincoln?
Do you have a letter from General Grant to John Wilkes Booth, in Grant's handwriting,
giving the kill order?
Do you have any old files that show how Grant's plot unfolded? Do you have any
financial records from Grant's cabal? Do you have letters from his associates
that denounced his treasonous behavior?
<p>
That's the difference between your story about Grant and my story about Bill Wilson.
I have the evidence. I have lots of evidence, starting with the <i>Big Book</i>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, where Bill Wilson described his plans and even gave
detailed instructions for how to hoodwink more people into joining his organization (chapter 7).
And then we have Bill's second book, the hateful, twisted,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, which clearly
reveals the depths of Bill Wilson's madness. And we have Bill's attempt at a
cover-up of what he had done, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>.
And we have two biographies that are based on the autobiographical tape recordings made
by Bill Wilson before his death &#8212; <i>Bill W.</i> by Robert Thomsen, and <i>Bill W.,
My First 40 Years</i>, by The Hazelden Foundation. And then we have the history of
A.A. according to the headquarters staff: <i>Pass It On</i>. And we have letters from
Henrietta Seiberling and Clarence Snyder. And we have old financial records from the
earliest days of The 100 Men Corporation, and Works Publishing.
We have various sundry documents from other early A.A. members.
And we even have a
signed, notarized, statement from Doctor Bob's daughter
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith">Sue Smith Windows</a>
that says that Bill Wilson stole the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i>,
and also stole the money that had been collected to publish the book.
<p>
Get together that kind of documentation to support your theory about General Grant and
you will become a famous historian very quickly.

<p>
The big difference between Bill Wilson and General Grant is that Grant didn't start
a cult religion and write books full of bombastic, grandiose lunacy that is supposed
to save the lives of alcoholics, but kills them instead.
General Grant isn't killing alcoholics today, but Bill Wilson is.
That's why I'm writing about Bill Wilson, and not General Grant.

Think of your AA website, and 
your dirty little tactics. If there are 10 interpretations of an event, you 
shall accept the one that suits your beliefs, and ignore all the others. If 
there are 100 scientific studies published, you will ignore the ones that 
refute your position, and state and restate, and restate, and restate, ad 
infinitum the one that fits your paradigm. If someone has heard of a letter 
(written by a trustworthy guy!) that may or may not have existed that 
purports to slander BIll W. you will accept that fictional document, and 
ignore 100 actual documents that disprove your point. You, Orange-pulp, are 
a medieval man. You have accepted a perfect universe, one that damns AA on 
every score, and, like Thomas Aquinas, you sit in your cubicle fitting every 
phenomenon into your neat little sphere. Congratulations! You are RIGHT! 
And, there's nothing that anyone, anywhere, can say to disprove you. 
<p>

And have a really nice day!

You speak of <i>&quot;10 different interpretations of an event.&quot;</i>
That is another common
line that I hear from steppers, as if truth is just a matter of having an
opinion or an interpretation, and one opinion is just as valid as any
other. It isn't.
<p>
Even Professor George E. Vaillant, Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
recognized that when he analyzed the results of his 8-year long test of Alcoholics
Anonymous treatment of alcoholics. He wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were no
better than the natural history of the disease.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<b>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</b>, George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1983, pages 283-286.<br>

The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<b>The Natural History of Alcoholism <i>Revisited</i></b>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The phrase &quot;compelling evidence&quot; is precise scientific language
that means that
the evidence forces Professor Vaillant to come to just one conclusion. There is no room
for wishful thinking, or for another 9 opinions. Facts are facts.
<p>
And that's how it is when you have alcoholics dying.
Whether they are dead isn't just
a matter of your opinion versus my opinion. And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Vaillant plainly stated</a> that A.A. failed
to help them, and they died.
<p>
And that's that.
<p>
Last but not least: you say,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If
there are 100 scientific studies published, you will ignore the ones that
refute your position...&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Quite wrong. I have collected every valid test of the effectiveness of A.A. that
I could find. And there aren't many. Also,
I am still waiting for some A.A. true believer to send me even one report of a valid
test of Alcoholics Anonymous treatment that shows A.A. to be good, effective, treatment
for alcoholism. I have been inviting such submissions for a long
time now, and have received nothing. So have at it. Send me something.
There are no good randomized controlled studies of the efficacy of A.A.
treatment that show that A.A. actually works, or saves lives that I know of,
not even one. All of the valid tests say
that A.A. <i>does not work</i>, and A.A. kills alcoholics. Even
A.A. Trustee George E. Vaillant got that result when he
did his 8-year-long test of A.A. treatment of alcoholics.
<p>
<a name="controlled_study"> </a>
How you do a good randomized controlled study is:
<ul>
<li> Get a large bunch of alcoholics from somewhere, the more the better.
<li> Randomly, evenly, divide them into two groups.
<li> Send one group to A.A..
<li> Do nothing with the other group. Just send them home and
ignore them. Let them drink all they want.
That's the control group that gets no &quot;treatment&quot; for alcoholism.
<li> Check on all of those alcoholics at least once a year, for as many years as possible,
preferably for at least for five or six years, and see how they are doing.
Count how many are dead, and how many are still drinking too much, and how many are abstaining,
and how many are drinking moderately. Also check their arrest records and see who got
repeatedly re-arrested for public drunkenness or for drunk driving.
<li> Then compare the results from the control group to the results from the A.A. group
to see what effect A.A. really had on the alcoholics.
</ul>
<p>
That experiment has been done
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">a few times</a>, and
the results were that A.A. did nothing good. It made the alcoholics
worse, and even killed them. Cult religion just is not a good
treatment program for alcoholism. Go read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html"><i>The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step
Treatment</i></a>.

<p>
For your information, what I don't want to receive is phony, faked, studies that are
just propaganda intended to fool people into thinking that A.A. works, like the
so-called studies that show that people who go to A.A. meetings drink less than
people who go to bars. Well of course. That isn't a test. Those people are self-selecting
groups. People who want to drink go to bars while the people who want to be sober, and
have been made to
believe that A.A. is somehow necessary for sobriety, go to A.A. meetings.
<p>
That is like discovering that the girls who join convents and become nuns get pregnant less
often than the girls who go out with the boys on Saturday night, so nuns' prayers must have a
magical birth-control effect.
<p>
Please don't submit articles like
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-spirrecov.html">Spirituality: The key to
recovery from alcoholism</a>&quot;</i>
or
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-pseudo2.html">The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</a>&quot;</i>.
Those things are not tests or experiments at all. They are just some more deceptive
propaganda.
<p>
And please don't forget the question,<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
Why do you applaud and cheer for people getting two-month coins at A.A. meetings,
but sneer at two years of sobriety achieved outside of A.A.?<br>
</font>
<p>
Please answer that question. Thank you.

Have a good day.

[fourth letter from Pitch Black, 24 January 2003:]
<p>

Dear Orange-pulp:
<p>

My apologies.  You're quite right.  You were referring to 12 Steps and 12 
Traditions, not the Big Book when you referred to Bill as a &quot;raving lunatic.&quot; 
But, you still didn't answer my objection to condemning all depressives, now 
did you?

<p><font color="blue">
I did not condemn all depressives. You are misquoting me again.
What I said was that it was grossly dishonest and phony for
Bill Wilson to write
that <i>12X12</i> was a manual for how to live happily by using
the Twelve Steps, and that <i>working the program</i> had not had any ill effects:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A.'s Twelve Steps are a group of principles, spiritual in their nature,
which, if practiced as a way of life, can expel the obsession to drink and
enable the sufferer to become happily and usefully whole.<br>
...<br>
Many people, nonalcoholics, report that as a result of the practice of A.A.'s Twelve
Steps, they have been able to meet other difficulties of life. They think that
the Twelve Steps can mean more than sobriety for problem drinkers.
They see in them a way to happy and effective living for many, alcoholic
or not.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 15-16.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But dependence upon an A.A. group or Higher Power hasn't produced
any baleful results.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 38.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson
hid the fact that he was actually so unhappy, so mentally ill, so depressed,
that he was completely disabled and
under the care of a psychiatrist &#8212;
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a>.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>No baleful results indeed</i>.<br>
</font>
The 12 Steps really
made Bill happy and usefully whole, didn't they?
After 16 years of <i>Working The Steps</i>, all he could do was lay in bed and stare
at the ceiling all day, or just sit in his office and hold his head in his hands
all day long. But he didn't bother to tell his readers about that part
of the story, did he, while he was telling everybody to <i>Work The Steps</i>?
That's what I was condemning. The deceit, the dishonesty.
</font><p>

I shall answer your question about my &quot;sneering&quot; at your two years 
of sobriety, but first, let me address a few of your issues.  First, let's 
take your comment about Lincoln having made the statement while I was &quot;out of 
the room.&quot;  Any historian knows that you have to be able to prove that a 
quote was rendered, not that a quote was NOT rendered. Even you know better 
than that.  If one uses that standard of historical accuracy, anything goes.  
They use that sort of logic down on the &quot;right&quot; side of AM radio.  You are 
quite right that Sandburg told that story.  You might wish to look at the 
copyright of Sandburg's book, while you're at it. It's quite, ... how shall 
I put it?  ... old.  Recent scholarship shows that the story is apocryphal.  

<p><font color="blue">
Hold on right there. That's another one of those sweeping, unsupported statements.
Show me the evidence. Cite the documentation. <i>Whose</i> &quot;scholarship&quot; shows that
Sandburg's biography of Lincoln is inaccurate, and that the story is apocryphal?
<p>
A little further down in this letter, you accuse me of using innuendo. You just gave
us a great demonstration of innuendo right there:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;You might wish to look at the copyright of Sandburg's book,
while you're at it. It's quite, ... how shall I put it? ... old.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
Since when does the publication date of Carl Sandburg's biography of Abraham Lincoln
determine whether it is a good biography? Abraham Lincoln is getting a little
old now, too, you know.


<p>
You make those dramatic statements
but you never supply any evidence to support your statements.<br>

I'm beginning to
suspect that you are just using
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#lie"><i>Propaganda Technique Number 2</i></a>&quot;
a lot: just make stuff up.<br>
<p>
Show me the proof.
<p>
</font><p>


As for you telling me that I'm &quot;quibbling&quot; about your &quot;get off their asses&quot; 
line, I"m afraid that is NOT quibbling.  It is typical of your whole strategy 
to play fast and loose with the facts, add in any old innuendo, to make a 
point.  You give yourself away, and I'm sure your more intelligent readers 
can see it in a second.  Let's take a simple example.  You blame Dr. Bob for 
his daughter's unhappy marriage.  She was under his Hitlerian fist. The poor 
dear!  But, your standard for everyone else is so high!  For we mortals, you 
demand that  we  stand on our own two feet, take responsibility for our own 
actions, etc. etc.  You grasp at any item that will further your argument, 
and because of that you are a fraud and a liar.  So, please go and &quot;research&quot; 
whether Lincoln told people to &quot;get off their asses.&quot;  Something tells me you 
won't waste much time on that project.   And, after your research shows 
you're wrong, will you edit that out of your website?  No, like Pilate, what 
you have written, you have written! 

<p><font color="blue">
So you think what Doctor Bob did to Sue is okay? You think that
shoving a constantly-relapsing, philandering old drunkard on his
daughter against her will was the act of a wise, sane, compassionate
man?
Do you really think that someone who would do that to his own daughter
is qualified to tell everybody else how to live?
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
And you want more research on Lincoln and Grant's whiskey?
</font>
Here is some more:
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of course, Mrs. Lincoln served wine to guests on formal occasions, and it was
often remarked that the President, despite his moral support for temperance in
the military, chose not to enforce such a policy. Nothing he said in this
regard was as well known as his joke about sending Grant's brand of whiskey to
other generals in the field. Obviously, if he was a total abstainer himself,
he was not eager to impose that standard on everybody
else.<font size="-1"><sup>80</sup></font><br>

T. LYLE DICKEY, [later] a judge of the Illinois Supreme Court . . . , at the time of Grant's
famous Vicksburg campaign [May-July, 1863], was on the General's staff as chief of cavalry.
Judge (then Colonel) Dickey had been sent to Washington with private dispatches for the
President and Secretary of War. Lincoln and Dickey had been intimate friends for years,
and during the latter's visit to the former on that occasion, Dickey remarked, &quot;I
hear that some one has been trying to poison you against Grant by reporting that he
gets drunk. I wish to assure you, Mr. President, that there is not a scintilla of truth
in the report.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, Colonel,&quot; replied the President, &quot;we get all sorts of reports here,
but I'll say this to you: that if those accusing General Grant of getting drunk will
tell me <i>where he gets his whiskey</i>, I will get a lot of it and send it around
to some of the other generals, who are badly in need of something of the kind.&quot;<br>

<p>
Are you going to claim that new &quot;scholarship&quot; has discredited those authors too?
Is all of that apocryphal too?

</font><p>



As far as research showing AA's efficacy, or lack thereof, every medical text 
I've encountered posits that AA does not lend itself to a scientific study, 
since the members are anonymous, don't sign any register, are not listed, 
etc. etc.

<p><font color="blue">
Once again, show me the proof. What &quot;medical texts&quot; said what?
I want quotations, citations, book names,
author names, page numbers. Or are you just making stuff up?
<p>
And you are really shooting yourself in the foot there.
It isn't a matter of <i>&quot;A.A. not lending itself to scientific study&quot;</i>.<br>
The faith-healing A.A. Twelve-Step program just flat-out does not work. Period.<br>
Voodoo medicine and faith healing do not work. Period.<br>
That's why A.A. cannot pass any real tests.<br>
That's why the true believers like you spread the
story that A.A. works in some magical non-scientific way that cannot be measured
or detected.
</font><p>



How do you count an AA member?  If he comes once, leaves, and comes 
again, leaves, and then gets sober, is he a failure twice and a success once? 
 This one guy would be counted as a 67% percent failure rate, yet in 
actuality, he's a 100% success.  You reject this logic, obviously, and hammer 
us to death with that single study from the Harvard Newsletter.  Are you 
certain that study was truly accurate?  It flies in the face of my 15 plus 
years of observation.  Has it been repeated?   Don't these kind of studies 
need to be repeated?  So, you accept this study unquestioningly, because it 
fits your paradigm.

<p><font color="blue">
Your logic about 'the 67% problem' is faulty.
I'm not counting anything that way, and neither
did Professor Vaillant or anyone else that I'm citing.
Of course you do not count them, or uncount them, every time they walk into or out
of &quot;the rooms&quot;.
<p>
I told you how to do a controlled study in the previous letter.
You count and measure all of the people in both groups at the end
of the test, and you compare the A.A. group to the control group to
see what effect A.A. had on the A.A. group.
<p>
It's really very simple. You are just trying to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#obfuscate">create confusion</a> to mask
the fact that A.A. does not have a success rate. (It just has a failure rate.)
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>Precisely what</i>
</font>
have you seen in your <i>&quot;15 years of observation&quot;</i>?
You again indulge in some vague hand-waving.
What percentage of the newcomers actually got sober?<br>

(And you have to count <i>all</i> of the newcomers, too. No excuses.)<br>
<p>
If the total success rate was 5% or less, then
that's just spontaneous remission at work, again. The number of additional people
who quit drinking, above and beyond the spontaneous remission rate, is zero.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">So
that gives A.A. a success rate of zero</a>. It's very simple.
So instead of just declaring that you have seen stuff,
<font color="#BF0000">
please tell us what your success rate has been for the last 15 years.
</font>

<p>
By the way, I challenged you to come up with even just one valid randomized
controlled study of A.A. that showed that A.A. works to cure or save alcoholics &#8212;
that shows that A.A. is an effective treatment program for alcoholism.
You seem to be ignoring or evading that challenge.
Instead, you claim that some unnamed medical books say
that you can't figure out what the A.A. success rate really is.
<p>
If you are going to ignore (or duck) the opportunity to show us the
success rate of A.A., then please do not again accuse me of<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If there are 100 scientific studies published, you will ignore
the ones that refute your position...&quot;<br>
</font>
What ones that refute my position? Show me the evidence. Never mind 100, show me just one.
</font><p>

Then, you  blithely assert that MOST people are able to 
recover on their own.  Well, maybe some of them do.  I never said that nobody 
recovers on their own.

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, <i>MOST</i>. Not &quot;some&quot;, <i>most</i>, like 80% of them, do it on their own.
Recovery without voodoo medicine or faith healing is the tried and
true method that works for most successful people.

</font><p>

However, has it ever occurred to you that any study 
that actually asks the person in question for an assessement of his/her 
drinking is bound to be flawed?  Aren't alcoholics notorious for lying about 
their drinking?  Isn't it likely that if you contacted a known alcoholic and 
asked  him how his drinking is progressing that he's going to tell you that 
"all is well?"

<p><font color="blue">
Dishonesty in answering questions is always a problem that researchers must
watch out for. However, you overlook the obvious fact that the people in both
the A.A. group and the non-A.A. group are probably equally likely to fib about their success
or failure, so the effect of prevarication is likely to cancel out.
<p>
And some things are pretty hard to hide, like being sick unto death from drinking.
People who are sick and stinking and hung-over aren't going to fool the researchers when
they claim that they haven't been drinking at all. And if they aren't sick or hung-over
or showing any ill effects from alcohol, and can easily fool the researchers,
then how much could they really be drinking?
<p>
Besides, the dead ones find it very difficult to lie and fool the researchers about
their current status.
<p>
You are again just trying to confuse the issue, and obfuscate the simple truth that
A.A. does not have a success rate.
</font><p>

<a name="cause6"> </a>
Why are you so willing to believe anyone who says that 
they've recovered on their own, yet are totally unwilling to believe anyone 
who says that they have recovered in AA?
Why do you believe and validate 
every person who relates an AA horror story, but reject every person who says 
that AA is wonderful and saved their lives?  Why do you use this double 
standard?  Maybe you can answer that question for me, &#8212; in less than 5,000 
words, and without citing George Valiant and the Harvard Newsletter, please.  

<p><font color="blue">
I do not reject every pro-A.A. story.
Read the file of &quot;<a href="orange-whats_good.html">What's Good About A.A.?</a>&quot;
Read the earlier letters.
What I object to is things like people making illogical jumps to conclusions, like:
<ol>
<li> I went to A.A. and then quit drinking.
<li> Therefore A.A. works.
</ol>
Item one does not prove item two.
<p>
Try this: What if someone says:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ol>
<li> I went to Satanic ceremonies where we offered up blood sacrifices to Satan, begging
Him to help us quit drinking.
<li> Right after that, I quit drinking.
<li> Therefore, praying to Satan, and making sacrifices to Satan, really works
great for getting sobriety.
</ol>
</font>
<p>
Are you buying that? I'm not. But it's the same bad logic:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc"><i>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc</i></a> &#8212;
&quot;It happened after something, so it was caused by that something.&quot;
</font><p>

You accuse AA's of being inflexible, and yet you are the most doctrinaire 
person I've ever encountered.  Let's take an example.  In your twisted 
medieval mind, AA is a &quot;total failure.&quot;  People who drop out of AA fail 
because of AA.  People who die after being exposed to AA die because of AA.  
People who die without going to AA die because AA was the only game in town 
and they preferred dying than going to AA.  AND, people who go to AA and get 
sober, are kidding themselves.  They really got sober by themselves, and 
their attendance at AA was just a coincidence, &#8212; something like a &quot;rabbit's 
foot&quot;, I think you said.  So, AA is a total, utter, comlete failure and 
abomination.  WOW.  I remember reading about this strategy of argumentation. 
It's called the &quot;Big Lie&quot; and its master proponent was none other than Adolf 
Hitler.  If you said that AA had some problems that needed ironing out, then 
everyone in  AA would agree with you.  And you'd hate that, would'nt you?
<a name="obsess"> </a>

So, you construct this monstrous conspiracy theory to satisfy some weird 
obsession.  Of course you don't see that, do you?  This website is dedicated 
to truth, justice, and the American way!  

<p><font color="blue">
You are trying to dodge the obvious truth that A.A. is basically a superstitious
program, one that is based on
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">dabbling in the occult</a>,
and one that tries to use faith healing
to cure a deadly problem. That's why it doesn't help people. That's why they die.
Teaching people to believe in the goofy dogma of A.A. does hurt them, and
even makes some of them die early. Professor George E. Vaillant, Class A Trustee of
Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">clearly showed that</a>, remember?
<p>
Constantly repeating the untrue story that A.A. works great is the Big Lie.
<p>
One thing that I can't help but notice is your total lack of evidence to support your
statements. You just complain about mine. You complain that I quote doctors
and professors and other knowledgeable people too much.
But you don't quote or cite anybody or anything.
You have not provided any evidence that A.A. works &#8212; you just say it works
because you wish to believe that it works. Where's the evidence? Where's the
proof?
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>What is your success rate?</i>
</font>
<p>
You are also trying to avoid the obvious fact that A.A. has gone out of its way
to suppress any alternative, competing methods of recovery. That isn't the American
way.
</font><p>

<a name="cheer_for2"> </a>

Now, finally, the answer to your question.  I didn't sneer at your two years 
of sobriety, although it may have seemed that way.  It is quite an 
accomplishment, actually.  I was sneering at your smug confidence that you 
have beaten the game, and you did it all by yourself.  I applaud the two-year 
man in AA because he still realizes that he's not out of the woods.  He knows 
that alcohol is a subtle foe, and that he has to treat the mental illness one 
day at a time.  You, in your arrogance, think that you've conquered it all by 
yourself.
<p><font color="blue">
In other words, yes, you are sneering at my two years, because I'm
not showing the proper fear, humility, and subservience.<br>

I am not a good cult member.<br>

You say that I am &quot;arrogant&quot; for not needing superstition and paranoia
in my life.
</font><p>


You think two years is a long time, but it is not long for John 
Barleycorn.  He's still got your number.  And, you can accuse me of 
fearmongering, because, my friend, there's much to fear!

<p><font color="blue">
You are anthropomorphizing again, and you really are also using fear-mongering.
There is no such monster as John Barleycorn who
is immortal, and who never rests, and who is stalking me in the dark,
waiting to get me.
You are just trying to scare the children with stories of the bogeyman, again.
(You really should go write scripts for Hollywood slasher movies.)
</font><p>

I've been sober 
many, many years longer than that, and I've seen arrogant guys like you... 
(and like me, for that matter) fall to alcoholism. If you do drink again, 
I pity you.  It will be pretty hard for you to come crawling in to AA after 
all the slander you've heaped on a program that has saved millions of lives.  
It will take a lot of humility, and I wonder if you've got it.
<p>
Yours, <br>

<p><font color="blue">
Even if I did return to drinking, I would not go to a voodoo medicine cult
to get help. But don't worry. I'm not really in as much danger as you think.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.<br>
And don't forget to tell us what &quot;scholarship&quot; has rendered

[Pitch Black's fifth letter, 26 January 2003:]
<p>


Dear Orange Pulp:
<p>

<font color="blue">

</font><p>
I don't think I can beat you up like this any more. It's really not right.  
I'm just going to point out that you have failed to address several points 
that I made in my last letter.  The reason for your failure to address my 
questions is because you ARE WRONG, and you know it   After all, you asked me 
to address my comment about sneering at your two years of sobriety.  I did as 
you requested, forthrightly, and directly.  So, let me repeat my points, and 
give you one more chance to address the issues.  
<p>

<font color="blue">
Beating up on me? Very funny. You haven't scored any points yet. I asked you for
some facts and you have not come up with one. I've already read this letter, and
I see that again you just make wild claims. You still have not supplied
a single fact, quotation, or citation to support your statements.
Are you allergic to books and libraries?
</font><p>

1. I asked you to comment on your quote of Lincoln that he told his generals 
to &quot;get off their asses.&quot;  I see that you have not addressed that issue at 
all, but rather, have sent me a list of undated material, the authors of 
which, undoubtedly read Sandburg.  So, let's leave it at that.  You are an 
amateurish historian.    I notice that you cite a book called &quot;Civil War 
Tales, Folklore, and Legends.&quot;  hahahaahahahahahahhaha..... You're really 
hurting me, here man!..  Which of those three things is the quote listed 
under?  Is it a TALE, FOLKLORE, or LEGEND?  Listen, it's not really worth our 
while to argue this one.  You're making a fool of yourself. Frankly, it's a 
great quote, and we all wish Lincoln actually had said it.    I read in 
several sources that it has been found to be untrue.  If I find the source, 
I'll send it along.  Meanwhile, have you deleted the line about &quot;asses?&quot;  It 
is an insult to our greatest national figure, you know.  
<p>

<font color="blue">
Oh, now that's really funny. You feel called upon to turn into a super-patriot
and gallantly defend the honor of President Abraham Lincoln?
I don't think he really needs your help.
<p>

As far as the &quot;get off of their asses&quot; phrase is concerned, I told you
that I was still looking. Have you gone to the library and gotten any quotes about
Sandburg's scholarship, or quotes from medical books on the efficacy of A.A. yet?

<p>
<i>Which</i> &quot;several sources&quot; found the story about Grant's whiskey to
be untrue, and <i>HOW</i> did they determine that it is untrue?
Can't you remember anything? Can't you give us even a little vague
hint about who discovered what, and when and where and how?
(When you challenged me, I came up with three quotes in a couple of days, remember?
So let's get with the program, shall we?)
Just because somebody
comes along and says that Carl Sandburg was wrong doesn't prove anything...
His documentation and references must be better than Sandburg's.
I'll definitely be waiting for your report.

<p>
The story in the book that you criticize would pretty obviously fall
into the category of &quot;tale&quot;, since it
involves a real historical figure and friend of Abraham Lincoln, Judge/Colonel
T. LYLE DICKEY, and was reported by another named person, Francis Fisher Browne.
<p>
I notice that you have simply ignored the other quote and its many references.

Are you going to claim that they are all bad historians, too? You claim that
they all &quot;undoubtedly read Sandburg&quot;.
Where is your evidence for that?
And what's wrong with that?
<p>
<ul>
<li> You just slander Carl Sandberg while providing no evidence whatsoever
that Carl Sandburg was mistaken.
<li> Then you try to pass off your assumption that Sandburg was wrong as a reason to proclaim
that everybody else is wrong too. That's a demonstration of the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii"><i>Petitio Principii</i></a>
&#8212; assuming facts not in evidence.
</ul>

And, as they say in the television infomercials: <i>But wait! There's more!</i>

<p>
But I suppose you are going to say that Eicher was corrupted by Carl Sandburg too, right?
<p>
And feast your eyes on this old quote. It just gets better and better:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Finally, in July 1862, when General Halleck was called to Washington as General-in-Chief,
Grant was put at the head of the armies of the West. There was much opposition to him.
Men came to the President urging his removal. Lincoln shook his head. &quot;I can't
spare this man,&quot; he said; &quot;he <i>fights</i>.&quot;
Many good people complained that he drank. &quot;Can you tell me the kind of whiskey?&quot;
asked Lincoln, &quot;I should like to send a barrel to some of my other generals.&quot;

<p>
Are you going to tell us that Mr. Tarbell was corrupted by Carl Sandburg back in
1895?
Sandburg's biography of Abraham Lincoln was not published until 1936.

<p>
Besides, do know what this whole argument is? It is the propaganda technique
called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#nitpick"><i>Nit-Picking</i></a>, as well as
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert"><i>Divert Attention</i></a>.
You keep hammering away at the Lincoln quote as if the worth of Alcoholics Anonymous
will be determined by whether Abraham Lincoln said that he wanted to send a barrel of
Grant's whiskey to his other generals who had yet to win a battle, or whether Lincoln
really said that he wished his generals would <i>get off of their asses</i> and go win
some battles. You pointedly ignore the important issues like
Bill Wilson's insanity and dishonesty,
and just want to argue about General Grant and Abraham Lincoln.
<p>
So let's get back to some relevant issues, like Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">the raving lunatic</a>,
and Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">the felonious thief</a>,
and Bill Wilson the phony holy man and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html">cult leader</a>,
and Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">the stock swindler</a>, and other fun stuff like that...

2.  Did Dr. Bob tie his daughter up and force her to walk down the aisle with 
that guy? Wasn't she over 18 years old?  When Dr. Bob &quot;shoved&quot; him her way, 
didn't she know how to say &quot;no&quot;?

<p>

She did say &quot;no&quot;.
She fought with her father for years over Ray Windows.
She was in love with Ray, and only wanted Ray.
Dr. Bob didn't like Ray because he was just a regular, rather unspectacular
high-school kid. Dr. Bob got the bright idea of
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Galbraith">using the older man Ernie Galbraith</a>, A.A. Number Four,
to split up Susan and Ray.

He asked Ernie to show an interest in Sue, to horn in and break up Sue and Ray.
It worked. Ray was 31 when Ray and Sue were only 17,
so Ernie was able to just heavy Ray out and scare him off.
<p>
But Ernie Galbraith was an alcoholic philanderer. Having him 
&quot;show an interest in&quot; Sue was really like having the fox guard the
henhouse. Any farmer stupid enough to do that should not be surprised to
find his plumpest hen eaten. The teenage girl Susan was pretty
defenseless against the well-practiced older charmer Ernie. So he seduced her
and took her for himself. Doctor Bob bitterly complained that Ernie had
&quot;double-crossed him.&quot;

He was a cruel petty tyrant &#8212; somebody who groveled like a naughty
little boy before his wife as she searched his pockets for liquor every
time he came into the house (read his story in the <i>Big Book</i>,
&quot;Doctor Bob's Nightmare&quot;),
but who was a harsh, cruel, autocratic tyrant to his children.
That's the classic <i>petty tyrant</i> &#8212; a weak man who gets his jollies
by lording it over someone else who is even weaker, like children.
(Or like shaky, weak, detoxing alcoholics, whom he made

Sue wrote about her earlier childhood:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The paddle Dad used on us came from a game that had a ball with it.
One end of the paddle was big and one end was little. Dad used the little
end, the part that hurt like the dickens. Mom would use the big end;
it didn't hurt so much for some reason. Well, Dad found out and he
whittled it down so that both ends were the same. He always kept that paddle
on an inside shelf of the bathroom closet. It was about a half-inch thick.
Like I say, when we got it, we knew it.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
What kind of a sick sadistic alcoholic child-abuser sits around whittling a paddle with
which to beat his children, carving it so that it will cause more pain?
<p>
And there is more, lots more, like the daughter of Susan and Ernie ended up
getting pregnant at 16, and then, several years later,
killed herself and her own young daughter with Ernie's shotgun in a double murder-suicide.
Neurosis and insanity ran rampant in the Smith family.

3. Was the famous Harvard study repeated?  Did they interview their subjects 
in order to get their information?  You, yourself admit that there is a 
problem with that approach.   Admit that this study is FLAWED, and stop 
citing it like it's gospel truth.  
<p>

<font color="blue">
How do you know it was flawed? You keep making these wild accusations, supported by
no facts at all. Why don't you go argue with the Harvard Medical School? All they do is
teach doctors and save lives, but what does that matter?
I'm sure that you know much more about medicine
than they do, right? When did you receive your doctorate?
<p>
To answer your other questions,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">the article in the
Harvard Mental Health Letter</a>
was a report that simply stated what the situation was, as they saw it,
as they summarized current medical knowledge.
It was not the results of one individual scientific experiment that might need to
be repeated for verification. If you don't like their conclusions,
then complain to the Harvard Medical School. Personally, I feel much
more comfortable trusting their opinion, rather than yours.
(They do not seem to have such a propensity for just making stuff up, or
making unsupported claims.)
</font><p>

4.  You keep demanding a scientific study of AA's success.  However, in the 
absence of a fascist state, how can we gather our research for this study 
that you demand?  IT CANT BE DONE!!!  CAN YOU HEAR ME??  IT CANT BE DONE!!  
Stop asking for what you know can't be produced.  
<p>

<font color="blue">
Now you are really losing it. That is pathetic.
<p>
A few letters earlier, you accused me of ignoring something like a
hundred scientific studies that reported positive results
for Alcoholics Anonymous, and of just picking a few that reported bad results.<br>
<p>
So I asked you to show me some of those allegedly positive reports, or even just one.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">You didn't.</font><br>
<p>
And now you claim that the studies cannot be done without
making our nation into a fascist state?
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Well, the NIAAA was able to do
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH">Project MATCH</a> without
plunging the USA into fascism, wasn't it?<br>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Professor George E. Vaillant,
Trustee of AAWS</a>, was able to do his 8-year longitudinal study of A.A.
treatment without having storm troopers goose-stepping down Pennsylvania
Avenue.<br>
<li>
And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a> managed to conduct his 5-year long study of the outpatient
treatment of alcoholism without moving Nazis into the White House.<br>
<li>
And then, even without the help of the Gestapo,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Diana C. Walsh and associates</a> managed
to conduct a test that allowed alcoholics a limited choice of treatment
programs.
That solves the problem of the unconstitutionality
of sentencing people to A.A., because A.A. meetings are religious ceremonies.
If you give them a choice between A.A. or some rational, non-religious
kind of treatment, then you aren't violating their civil rights.
The results were: those who chose AA still did the worst (about as bad
as those who were assigned to AA).<br>
</ul>
<p>
So your lame excuse that we cannot test A.A. without making the USA a fascist state is
ridiculous. It is doubly ridiculous when we consider how steppers love to
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Little_Red_Book">have the
judge sentence drunk drivers to go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings</a>.
Fascism and violation of people's civil rights doesn't bother you then, does it?
<p>
Besides, you accused me of ignoring something like a hundred scientific
studies that existed. Where are they?
</font><p>

<a name="cause7"> </a>
5.  Why won't you accept anyone's  experience at face value, UNLESS it 
corresponds to your notions of reality.  Why do you deny that AA ever works 
for anyone, when thousands of people claim it works for them right now?  You 
didn't address your double standard?
<p>

<font color="blue">
I don't accept anecdotal evidence and testimonials as proof of anything because
they are completely unreliable and worthless, that's why.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#anecdote">
We've been over this before</a>. Testimonials are nothing but stories like:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I was sick. I drank Dr. Bummer's Green Snake Oil&reg; and then I got
better. So that green snake oil is really great medicine,
and it really works good.&quot;</i></font><br>
The speaker has no way of knowing
whether he got better because of the snake oil, or because his body just healed
itself, just the same as it always does.
<p>
That's why the FDA demands rigorously-controlled randomized tests and studies
of drugs and treatments, and will not even consider testimonials, stories, or
anecdotal evidence as proof of efficacy.
<p>
We discussed testimonials in the previous letter. Such bad logic is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc"><i>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc</i></a>.
That means,
&quot;It happened after something, so it was caused by that something.&quot;
That is, of course, invalid logic, just jumping to conclusions, and
seeing <i>cause-and-effect</i> relationships where none exist.
It is just like
<font color="green">
&quot;Every morning, the rooster crows. Then the sun rises.
So the rooster's crowing makes the sun rise.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Even worse, the way that A.A. uses testimonials is biased and dishonest. If someone
quits drinking, then A.A. and the Twelve Steps get the credit. If someone relapses
and dies drunk, then the individual A.A. member gets all of the blame.<br>
It's a <i>&quot;Heads I win, Tails you lose&quot;</i> con game.
<p>
And, A.A. routinely disavows any connection with the failures. The drop-outs
and failures are stubbornly ignored when you count your
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;thousands
of people [who] claim it works for them&quot;</font>.
You always say something like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well,
they didn't do the program right, so they don't count.&quot;</font>
<p>
Likewise, how about this logic:
<p><font color="#4f007f">
1.) Joe did his Fifth Step and quit drinking. Therefore, The Fifth Step
works to make people quit drinking.<br>
<p>
2.) <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Paddy">Paddy</a> and
<a href="orange-recruit.html#Jackie">Jackie</a> did a bunch of
Twelfth-Step recruiting work, and then they relapsed and went out and
died drunk. Therefore, the Twelfth Step works to make people go out and die drunk.
</font>
<p>
That's anecdotal evidence, and proof by anecdote. Do you find that acceptable?
<p>
In addition, the stories in the <i>Big Book</i> are just so much cherry-picking.
Bill Wilson <i>never</i> told what really happened with <i>Big Book</i> authors
who relapsed.
When
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success">early <i>Big Book</i>
authors relapsed</a> and died drunk, their stories were simply silently replaced.
Think about Henry Parkhurst,
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#woman_stay" target="_blank">Florence Rankin (the second A.A. woman)</a>,
and Ernie Galbraith,
all of whom wrote stories for the <i>Big Book</i> about how A.A. had saved them from alcoholism.
When they went out and died drunk, Bill didn't bother to report what actually happened to them,
did he? No, Bill just quietly replaced their stories with some more stories from other people who
raved about how A.A. had saved their lives.
That is grossly dishonest. And that makes such testimonials completely worthless.
<p>
It's just like your refusal to answer my question about
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;What is your success rate?&quot;</font><br>
You stubbornly refuse to discuss hard numbers, and instead just wave your hands
in the air and claim
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;it works for thousands&quot;</font>...

</font><p>


And, while we're at it, here are a few more questions for you:
<p>

<font color="blue">
And, while we are at it, stop right there.<br>
The propaganda technique you are now trying to pull is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert">
<i>Divert Attention</i></a>. You are trying to change the subject
to avoid dealing with all of the points you have lost.
<p>
Before we go off on a tangent, there is a lot of unfinished old business:
<ol>
<p><li> How do you rationalize Bill Wilson writing that 16 years of <i>Working The Steps</i>
and being dependent on Alcoholics Anonymous had produced &quot;no baleful results&quot;
while the truth was that he was so depressed that he was completely nonfunctional and under
the care of a psychiatrist?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,

</blockquote>
<p>

<p><li> You stated:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;every medical text I've encountered
posits that AA does not lend itself to a scientific study...&quot;</font><br>
<p>
And I said:<br>
<font color="green">
'Once again, show me the proof. What &quot;medical texts&quot; said
what? I want quotations, citations,
book names, author names, page numbers. Or are you just making stuff up?'<br></font>
<p>
You have been noticeably silent on the subject.

<p><li> You said:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It flies in the face of my 15 plus years of observation...&quot;</font><br>
<p>
And I asked:<br>
<font color="green">
<font color="#BF0000"><i>Precisely what</i></font>
have you seen in your <i>&quot;15 years of observation&quot;</i>?<br>
You again indulge in some vague hand-waving.<br>
What percentage of the newcomers actually got sober?<br>
(And you have to count <i>all</i> of the newcomers, too. No excuses.)<br></font>
<p>
You have been noticeably silent on the subject.<br>
Don't you even want to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">brag about your great success rate</a>?<br>
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>What is your success rate?</i>
</font>
<p>

<p><li>
I said,<br>
<font color="green">
&quot;You are trying to dodge the obvious truth that A.A. is basically
a superstitious program, one that is based on dabbling in the occult,
and one that tries to use faith healing to cure a deadly problem.
That's why it doesn't help people. That's why they die.&quot;</font><p>

You haven't answered that.

<p><li> Don't forget the answer to: &quot;What expert historians have
proven that Carl Sandburg's famous huge multi-volume
biography of Abraham Lincoln is now obsolete and unreliable?&quot;

<p><li> And don't forget: &quot;Where are the hundred scientific studies
that you accused me of ignoring?&quot;

</ol>
<p>
Now, I guess we can look at your new questions:
</font><p>


6. Do you think tobacco addiction and alcohol addiction are the same things, 
basically?    It seems that virtually everyone who used tobacco becomes 
addicted to it, but a minority of people who use alcohol develop problems.  
You don't believe that we alcoholics have any underlying problems?  We just 
overdid it, and got hooked.  So, just get unhooked, and all is well?  I think 
you're kidding yourself.  But, I like to think I'm open minded.  Convince me. 
 
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are not even making any sense there.
<p>
What does tobacco addiction have to do with alcoholics having underlying problems,
besides the fact that tobacco makes alcoholics' health problems even worse?
Of course getting unhooked will improve the situation. But what's your point?
<p>
If you are trying to imply that I don't know that alcoholics often have other
problems besides drinking too much, then you have it exactly backwards. I'm the
one who has been objecting to
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications">
some fundamentalist steppers telling my friend not to
take his medications</a>. If you had bothered to read the cult test, you would know that.
I have repeatedly criticized A.A. for failing to deal with underlying medical or
psychiatric problems, and telling people not to take their medications,
and just insisting that the Twelve Steps will fix everything.
<p>
Ah, but there is really one more twist to this thing in your mind, isn't there?<br>
It's what actually started this whole long exchange of letters.

<i>&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">Us Stupid Drunks</a>&quot;</i>
and flipped out when I
actually said one good thing about one alcoholic &#8212; General Ulysses S. Grant.
You couldn't handle that.
You couldn't handle me criticizing Bill Wilson's stereotype of alcoholics that
says that all alcoholics are selfish
and manipulative and resentful and self-seeking and examples of self-will run riot
and instincts gone astray...
The &quot;underlying problem&quot; that you are hinting at is
<font color="#BF0000"><i>SIN</i></font>, isn't it?
It's &quot;sin&quot;, also known as &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
also known as &quot;character defects&quot;.
That's the underlying problem that you hint that I am
ignoring, isn't it?
You want to claim that all of those nasty criminal alcoholics must go
to A.A. and confess their sins in order to get just a &quot;one-day reprieve
from death&quot;, right?
<p>
You imagine that nobody can recover from alcoholism unless they get religion
and get down on their knees and start confessing everything to God, don't you?
</font><p>

7.  You aren't true to your own logic either, I think.  You tell people to 
get sober by themselves.  But when people say they can't, you tell them to go 
to one of the alternative AA's.  Are you sure they're not &quot;cults&quot; also?  
Maybe you better start researching them.  Also, if you admit that there are, 
indeed, people who can't get sober by themselves, then why do you claim that 
everyone who goes to AA and gets sober, basically DID do it by themselves.  
Would they have done it by themselves if there was no AA to go to?  Isn't 
this a weakness in your case?  
<p>

<font color="blue">
<ul>
<li> I said that I got sober by my own efforts, without any group.
<li> I said that <i>&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;</i>
was the way that most successful people do it.
<li> The
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">Harvard Medical School said</a>
that 80% of the successful quitters do it alone.
<li> And, when a previous
correspondent challenged me to come up with a program that works as well as
A.A., I said, <i>&quot;That's easy: No treatment. Nothing. Do It Yourself.&quot;</i><br>
Nothing, no treatment at all, works just as well as Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ul>
<p>
But I never said that everybody had to do it that way.
<p>
<a name="not_cult"> </a>
I have repeatedly,
<font color="#BF0000"><i>even in letters to you</i></font>,
said that the support of
a group of friends can be helpful, and that a change of environment, to get out of old habits,
can be helpful, and I recommended that people check out other groups like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005651/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005651/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a>,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005651/http://www.womenforsobriety.org/">WFS</a>,
and MFS, to see if they like them, and to see if they can be helpful.
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
So why aren't those other groups also cults?</font><br>
That is a wonderful question. I'm so glad you asked.
<p>
Well, just to give you a very short list of the most obvious items:
<ol>
<li> They don't say that you have to
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_exit">go to their meetings forever</a>.
<li> They don't push
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality">insane, irrational dogma</a>,
voodoo medicine, and faith healing.
<li> They don't claim that they can make you
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">hear the voice of God</a>, telling you what to
do, and giving you the power to do it.
<li> They don't try to
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#moral_inventory">make you feel guilty</a> by
demanding that you make lists of every
sin you ever committed, and every wrong ever done to another person.
<li> They don't
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step5">make you confess your sins</a>
to another group member.
<li> Their meetings are not public confession sessions.
<li> They don't push superstition as medical treatment.
<li> They don't demand that you
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step3">
surrender your will and your life</a> to the group.
<li> They don't demand that you become

<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias">induce phobias</a>
&#8212; they don't tell people that they will die drunk if they quit the group.
<li> They don't induce feelings of
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step1">powerlessness</a> in members.

<li> They don't tell you to get a sponsor who will supervise your indoctrination.
<li> They don't tell people with mental problems
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds">not to take their doctor-prescribed medications</a>.
<li> Their organizations weren't founded by, and their doctrines weren't created by,
a psychotic who suffered from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">
delusions of grandeur</a> and a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic">
narcissistic personality disorder</a>.
<li> Likewise, their primary books and manuals are not the ravings of that psychotic.
<li> Their organizations are not just off-shoots of
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">an old cult religion</a>.
<li> They do not teach that you can 
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#idolatry">
just make up any old God or &quot;Higher Power&quot;
of your own choosing, and pray to it, and get great results</a>.

<li> They don't say that your mind is defective and that your thinking is alcoholic,
so you should just
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_deceived">let your sponsor do your thinking for you</a>.
<li> They don't claim to have
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#solve_all">a panacea</a>.

<li> They don't claim that they are
&quot;<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step11">Seeking and Doing the Will of God</a>&quot;.

<li> They don't try to saturate beginners with their dogma by demanding that beginners
do 90 meetings in 90 days.
<li> They don't claim to have
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way"><i>The One And Only Way</i></a>.
<li> They do not demand that you
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step11">pray to God or some other &quot;Higher Power&quot;</a>.
<li> They don't bombard you with slogans, thought-stopping clich&eacute;s, and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak">in-group lingo</a>.
<li> They don't consider the first 164 pages of their books to be so holy that those books
cannot be changed, corrected, or updated, even one tiny little bit.
<li> They don't claim that God <a href="orange-rroot030.html#Bill_guided">guided</a>
their leader to write the group's book.
<li> No hero worship. They don't have
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_guru_right">holy gurus like Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob</a>.
<li> They don't practice
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">deceptive recruiting</a>.
<li> They don't practice
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">coercive recruiting</a>.
<li> They don't pull a lot of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html">bait and switch stunts</a> on you.
<li> They don't have programs that look like carbon copies of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">standard brainwashing programs</a>.

Basically, Pulpie, I think you're off the wall.  You have a deep hatred of 
AA, and you've channelled all this energy into this website.  I must admit 
that it has its attractions, and God knows AA could be improved.
<p>
<font color="blue">
My &quot;deep hatred&quot;, as you call it, is basically my objection to
A.A. and N.A. hurting my friends with cult religion and voodoo medicine.
Knock it off,
and quit doing
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">deceptive recruiting</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">coercive recruiting</a>,
and quit telling everybody that a superstitious faith-healing cult is the
best way to treat alcoholism,
and we won't have anything to argue about.
I have said many times that I don't care if some crazy burned-out old alcoholics
want to huddle in church basements and convince themselves that they are
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#chosen_people">the Chosen Children of God</a>...
</font><p>

But, I think that this will be my last message to you for a while.

<p><font color="blue">
So you are just going to use
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hit_and_run">the hit-and-run tactic</a>?
Just make a lot of wild unsubstantiated accusations and sweeping allegations,
backed up by no evidence whatsoever, and then run away?
Not even going to stay around long enough to supply any facts to
support your statements? I still haven't seen one single quote, or one single
citation in support of anything &#8212; not one reference, and not one document
or book. Nothing but hot air.
<p>
Aren't you even going to give us one single report of a valid scientific
experiment &#8212; a randomized controlled study &#8212; where Alcoholics Anonymous
showed good results? Not even one, out of the hundred that you accused me
of ignoring?
</font><p>

I'll allow you 
the last opportunity to kick the hell out of me.  I think your readers, &#8212; if 
you have any other besides me &#8212; will see the underlying flaws in your 
reasoning.  And, I hope that one day, you too will see how twisted your

You bring your suffering on yourself. I didn't force you to come
here and embarass yourself by making foolish statements.
</font><p>

As for your sobriety, congratulations on your two years, but I believe that 
10 years is really necessary to prove the point.

<p><font color="blue">
Ten years is necessary to prove what point? To whom?<br>
Do you think that sobriety is a show, or a contest?<br>

way back down to &quot;Start&quot;, and have to give back all of your accumulated

Is your goal in life to prove
that your cult is <i>The One And Only True Cult Of God</i> by staying sober
longer than your critics?<br>
Even if you were to stay sober longer than everybody
else in the world, it would not prove that A.A. members are really <i>Seeking
and Doing the Will of God</i>.
</font><p>


A lot of us stayed sober for two years, only to fall later on.
<p><font color="blue">
Yeh, I hear that happens in A.A. a lot.
</font><p>

I dot care if you've got quality 
sobriety, or dry drunk sobriety.  Honestly, I think I'm off the beam much of 
the time myself.  So, hold onto my email address, and I'll do the same.  In 
10 years, I'd like to see what kind of tune you're singing.  My experience 
tells me that you'll find that old John does exist. He's not &quot;out there,&quot; 
he's &quot;in here&quot; and we're in much deeper trouble than you think.

</font><p>

<hr>
<p>
[Pitch Black's sixth letter, 26 January 2003:]
<p>

I made an error on my most recent letter.  Instead of saying &quot;undated 
material,&quot; I should have said, &quot;material dated no later than 1934.&quot;  
<p>

Pitch Black

<p>
<font color="blue">
This is odd. So what does the year 1934 have to do with biographies of Abraham Lincoln?
Did they decide to change the history of the Civil War that year?
<p>
Or are you just using some innuendo and implying
that Carl Sandburg was a bad historian, and that all subsequent
historians are so incompetent that they only read Sandburg and are
all contaminated by him, so no
history written after Sandburg's famous huge multi-volume biography of
Abraham Lincoln was published is any good at all? Do you really expect
us to believe that all good historical scholarship came to a screeching
halt in 1934? No modern historian reads anything but Carl Sandburg?
<p>
Your argument, dear sir, is absurd, right down there on the level of Bill Wilson's
brain-damaged logic.
<p>
Besides, I already came up with the quote from Ida Tarbell that was published
in 1895. Unless Carl Sandburg had a time machine, he couldn't have misinformed
Mr. Tarbell.
<p>
Incidentally, the volumes that I have in my hands say that
Carl Sandburg's biography of Abraham Lincoln &#8212; <i>The War Years</i> &#8212;
was published in 1936, 1938, and 1939, not 1934. But that is a triviality now.
<p>

<p>
How long will I have to wait to hear from you just what &quot;scholarship&quot;
<i><b>proved</b></i>
that Carl Sandburg's biography of Lincoln is wrong, and that
the story of President Lincoln joking about sending lots, cases, or barrels of
General Grant's
whiskey to his other generals is apocryphal?<br>
<p>
'Til Hell freezes over?
<p>
Oh, and now you also have to prove Ida Tarbell wrong, too.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<hr>
<p>
[Pitch Black's seventh letter, 29 January 2003:]
<p>

Orange pulp:
<p>
I have two points.
<p>

1.  I never said Grant was NOT a drinker. He clearly was.
<p><font color="blue">
I never accused you of saying that Grant was not a drinker.
</font><p>

Also, Lincoln certainly responded to criticism of Grant
by saying &quot;I can't spare this man, he fights.&quot; What he clearly
did NOT say was that they should &quot;get off their asses.&quot;

<p><font color="blue">
But you did say that Lincoln never said that he wanted to send Grant's whiskey to
his other generals so that they would win some battles.
The second sentence of your second letter was:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;There is no evidence that Lincoln ever said that line
about sending the other generals a case of whatever Grant drank.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
</font><p>

Since you have now cited 5 or 6 accounts of this exchange, and not one of them contains
that line, when are you going to edit it out of your website?
<p><font color="blue">
I have. I'm now using Carl Sandburg's quote, which you have failed to discredit.
</font><p>

How  much &quot;research&quot; are you going to do
before you admit that your attribution is (another) lie?

<p><font color="blue">
Not a lie. I was simply recalling a humorous story from memory.
There is a big difference between remembering a joke with different wording
than some book uses, and a deliberate lie.
After all, I'm not accusing you of lying for saying,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;There is no evidence that Lincoln ever said that line
about sending the other generals a case of whatever Grant drank.&quot;<br>
</font>
I'll shrug that off as a simple, honest, uninformed, mistake.
<p>

But since you prompted me to go to the library and look up several
different versions of Lincoln's joke,
I'll use Carl Sandburg's version of the story &#8212; at least until you prove
that Carl Sandberg was wrong. I'm still waiting for your evidence that
Sandburg was wrong. Oh, and now, that Ida Tarbell was also wrong.
And Merrill D. Peterson, and Francis Fisher Browne, and David J. Eicher...
</font><p>

And, while we're at it, what is the proper path to take with regard to
a quote like that?  To leave it in place while you search for it, or to
take it out until you find it?  Any reputable historian would never
publish a quote like that without a single source.  But,
you're not a reputable historian, are you?  You're a quack.

<p><font color="blue">
I never claimed to be a historian. My web site is about Alcoholics Anonymous,
the quack treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction, and cult religions,
not the history of the Civil War.
</font><p>

But, I prefer that you leave that line in place.  Anyone reading
your website, and seeing my comments will immediately recognize that my
point is valid, that Lincoln would never use an _expression like that,
and the fact that you have left it in your website in spite of its obvious
inaccuracy is a beacon, shedding light on your whole crazy mindset.  As I
said before, you are doctrinaire, utterly unwilling, and unable to admit
that anything you say can possibly be wrong.
<p><font color="blue">
I have never made any such claim.
</font><p>

Please look that trait up in the DSM and see what diagnosis we come up
with for you. Grandiose? Narcissistic? Borderline personality?  I wonder
how your family, (if you have one) puts up with your perfection all the
time.  If your website is any guide, it must be pretty tough living with
a guy like you, who is absolutely never wrong. Sort of Dr. Bob-ish of
you, don't you think? 

<p><font color="blue">
Okay, now that you have gotten that textbook example of an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#personal"><i>Ad Hominem</i> attack</a>
out of your system, perhaps you can
get around to answering those unanswered questions from the previous letter,
all of which are far more important than President Lincoln's joke about
General Grant's whiskey:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Produce those quotes from all of those medical books that you referred
to when you said that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;every medical text I've encountered posits that AA does not lend
itself to a scientific study.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<li> Cite those alleged 100 scientific studies of A.A. that you accused me of ignoring:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If there are 100 scientific studies published, you will ignore
the ones that refute your position, and state and restate, and restate,
and restate, ad infinitum the one that fits your paradigm.&quot;<br>
</font>
Heck, I'm easy. Just give me 20.<br>
Can't you even come up with 10?<br>
One?<br>
<p>
Remember that they must be valid scientific studies, not
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html">dishonest pseudo-science</a> or
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html">deceptive propaganda</a>.<br>
Oh, and the reason that I have to repeat the truth so much is because you stubbornly
refuse to get it. You seem to have a problem that A.A. calls <i>being in denial</i>.

<p>
<li> Explain Bill Wilson's writing that he had gotten
<i>&quot;no baleful results&quot; from many years of practicing the
Twelve Steps and being dependent upon an A.A. group</i>, when he was
actually so mentally ill and depressed that he was completely crippled
and non-functional, and under the care of the psychiatrist
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a> when he wrote
that remark.
<p>
<li> In your &quot;15 plus years of observation&quot; of A.A. that you bragged about,<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
What has your real success rate with all of the newcomers actually been?<br>
</font>
That's a very simple question, so why won't you anwer it?<br>
You must know what your success rate has been.<br>
Your brain works, doesn't it? Your memory works, doesn't it?

<p>
<li> And you still haven't responded to the statement:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;You are trying to dodge the obvious truth that A.A. is basically
a superstitious program, one that is based on
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">dabbling in the occult</a>,
and one that tries to use faith healing to cure a deadly problem. That's
why it doesn't help people. That's why they die.&quot;
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
And then I will add one more question:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Is your behavior here an example of
what 15 years of <i>Working The Steps</i> turns somebody into?
</ul>
</font><p>

2.  Ida Tarbell is a woman.

<p>

[ Pitch Black's eighth letter, January 31, 2003: ]<br>
<p>

Dear Orange:
<p>
Please don't publish this letter on your website.

<p><font color="blue">
Sorry, but I never promised not to print your letters. And after seven of them,
it's a little late to start now. Besides, I still have not printed your
real name or email address, so you still have your anonymity.
<p>
Now, if you were a patient in a treatment program who would get in
trouble for telling me what was going on there,
then that would be a very different matter. But that isn't
the case here. I've already posted seven of your letters,
and you didn't object, so I might as well finish the series.
</font><p>

I don't want to debate 
with you anymore. To sum up about the Civil War:  You correctly pointed 
out that I claimed that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; that Lincoln made the &quot;case 
of whiskey&quot; remark. I mis-spoke.  There is ample evidence that he said it, 
and you have provided excellent sources.

<p><font color="blue">
Then I guess you also misspoke when you called me a &quot;a fraud and a liar&quot; and a 
&quot;quack&quot; historian, right?
</font><p>

However, I have read in several 
modern sources that the story, which is admittedly wonderful, is probably not 
true.  If I ever come upon the source, I'll send it to you. However, you have 
every right to publish the story, as is.  I'm sort of surprised, however, 
that you do not recognize that modern historical research methods are vastly 
superior to those of 100 years ago.  Sandburg was great for his time.  But, 
he isn't assigned in the colleges anymore.

<p><font color="blue">
There you go again, with character assassination, innuendo, and grand, sweeping,
statements that are supported by no facts whatsoever. You just won't quit doing it,
will you?
(Don't you notice that repeating pattern in your behavior?)
You still have not come up with one single fact to support your attacks on the
scholarship of Carl Sandburg, but you continue to slander him.
<p>

Besides the obvious fact that we can use computers to archive, search and index large
amounts of information much faster, just how have &quot;modern historical research
methods&quot; become
&quot;vastly superior&quot;? The truth is, we have exactly the same historical source
documents about Lincoln available today as existed 100 years ago.
Abraham Lincoln has not written or spoken anything new in the last century,
because he's been dead.
We still use the same English language, and the truth is still the truth, and
a lie is still a lie. So what has changed so much?
<p>
And do you have some surveys of college American history teachers that tell us what
texts they use in their courses today, and what they used many years earlier,
to show that Carl Sandburg has fallen out of favor?
Do you have a survey of college history teachers' opinions of Carl Sandburg?
</font><p>

I'm glad to see that you have 
taken the &quot;asses&quot; line out of your website, as that was clearly not 
supportable by any evidence.

<p><font color="blue">
&quot;...clearly not supportable by any evidence&quot;?<br> 
As Carl Sagan said,
<i>&quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;</i><br>

I am still looking. It's only been two weeks, and I've already come up with 5 quotes
that you insisted didn't exist,
and I do also have other things to do with my life.
But I haven't found the exact quote that I was remembering, so
I'll use Carl Sandburg's quote for now.
<p>
And speaking of quotes, I'm still waiting for some from you &#8212; the scientific
studies of A.A., and the medical books' statements, remember?
</font><p>

As far as Ida Tarbell is concerned, she is a famous &quot;muckraker&quot;
who wrote &quot;The History of Standard Oil,&quot; which led up to 
the Supreme Court case that broke up the monopoly in 1911.  I wasn't aware of 
her Civil War writings.  

<p><font color="blue">
</font><p>


This exchange of letters has lost its allure for me.

<p><font color="blue">
Lost its allure? Do you think that this is all just a game?
People are dying over this stuff.
People are
really getting hurt by Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, their misinformation,
their ineffective superstitious 12-step treatment of alcoholism
and drug addiction, and the crazy proselytizing members who want to shove their
cult on every victim they can get &#8212;
and all you care about is &quot;the allure of the debate&quot;?
What kind of a sick ego trip is that?
You think that you can just parrot a stream of standard A.A. misinformation 
for fun, until the thrill is gone, and then run away?
What kind of &quot;spirituality&quot; is that?
</font><p>

I think we know where we stand on the issues.
<p><font color="blue">
No, I don't know where you stand. I am beginning to suspect that you
suffer from some kind of a psychiatric problem, and don't
really stand anywhere on anything.
There does not seem to be very much correlation between the words that come
out of your mouth and the reality that is around you.
</font><p>

In a previous letter, you said that I had not scored 
a single point.  I certainly hope that you give me a bit more credit than 
that.  And I sure won't give you a score of zero, either.  But, win, lose, or 
draw, I would like to bring it to an end amicably.  Good luck with your 
future endeavors.
<p>

<p><font color="blue">
You have not scored a single point because you have not produced a single
fact to support any of your statements, nor have you have even supported your statements

You have not come up with one single quote or citation or reference,

Your statements about Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism, and recovery are obviously

You seem to think that it's fun to blow a lot of hot air, and make things up,
and say whatever you want to say, and attack people's character and call them liars,
and then just change the subject when challenged and asked
to prove your statements.
<p>
And now you are going to just run away, rather than answer the questions.
That is the behavior of a very dishonest person, or a mentally ill person, 
or the kind of person that Bill Wilson described as:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest
with themselves.
There are such unfortunates.
They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way.
They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner
of living which demands rigorous honesty.<br>

3rd Edition, Chapter 5, &quot;How It Works&quot;, page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

You do not score debating points by refusing to answer the
important questions like<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;What is your success rate?&quot;
</font>
<p>
But I must thank you for your letters. There is just nothing that I could ever 
have written that would have so clearly shown our readers just what a horror
Alcoholics Anonymous really is, and what 15 years of <i>Working
the Steps</i> does to people's minds.
Oh, and also what kind of a sponsor they are in danger of getting if
they try the A.A. program.
