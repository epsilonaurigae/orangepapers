Subject:  	AA lies<br>

<p>
Thanks for the info about the lies of AA. I'm not really familiar with your style of
criticism, so I became confused as to which points you were making. I suppose I
should have interpreted most of your writing as sarcasm.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Shapiro,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
No I am not being sarcastic. Oh, I may use sarcasm and humor a little bit, like
when I have
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#hear_instructions" target="newwin38">Batman and Robin discussing Doorknob Almighty</a>,
but by and large, I mean what I say quite literally.

</font>
<p>
In any case, you make some solid arguments, but I am afraid that the simple truth
about AA &#8212; or whatever you want to call it (cult, self-help group, religion,
faith-healers, etc.) &#8212; is that it provides a program to remove the barriers between
a life run by Self (ego) and a world not run by Self. For many of us, that requires
a spiritual awakening and connection which has to be reestablished regularly.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Right there, you have demonstrated what is wrong with Alcoholics Anonymous.
That whole rap is bullshit. Pardon my language, but that is bullshit, pure and simple.
&quot;Ego&quot; or &quot;Self&quot;, with a capital 'S', is not the cause
of alcohol abuse or alcohol addiction.
<p>
I know that line is standard A.A. dogma. It was also standard Oxford Group dogma.
And such dogma is why Alcoholics Anonymous does not work to make alcoholics quit drinking.
Reheated Buchmanism is not a cure for alcoholism.
</font>
<p>
And it also requires regular admission of the mistakes one makes while interacting
with demanding wives, children, employers, neighbors, and strangers, not to mention
domesticated and wild animals! I don't see how you could oppose admission of one's
faults. I am capable of serious finger-pointing, and I have come to learn that it is
rarely justified (and even then I am still unjustified in being angry or acting out
in anger).

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is zero evidence that engaging in &quot;regular&quot; confession sessions
makes alcoholics quit drinking. The evidence is that the A.A. practices
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin33">raise the
death rate in alcoholics</a>, including raising the suicide rate.
A.A. also
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin34">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin35">raises the rate of rearrests</a>.

</font>
<p>
I wish you the best of luck, but I can only tell you that it is very liberating to
walk around town, look people in the eye, and be cordial, especially to my loved
ones.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, quitting excessive drinking really makes you feel better. And quitting both
drinking and smoking can make you feel fantastically better.
That has nothing to do with practicing Buchmanism, of course.
</font>
<p>
The simple fact of the matter is that, for alcoholics that drank like I did, there
is really only one solution to living a life happy, joyous, free... or at least
somewhat comfortable.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="newwin34">Only one solution</a>.
That is a standard cult rap.
<i>&quot;Only our guru/church/group/organization has the magic answer.&quot;</i>
That is, in fact, one of the key characteristics of a cult. It's in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="newwin36">the Cult Test</a>.

<p>
And of course, the truth is that far, far more alcoholics successfully drinking without
A.A. than with it.

I couldn't admit I was powerless and was told I was, regardless... and that I needed

I &quot;faked it&quot; for my stay there.  What I noticed was the majority of the younger

You did not say whether you have 5 years of sobriety in A.A.; just that you have

Subject:  	inquiry<br>

<p>
To whom it may concern:

<p>
What a wonderfully informative website. I stumbled across it just recently and the
material has kept me captivated. Are people able to contact you with questions, are
you an advocate,
do you have a mission, is there a cause, or something that I can learn more about? I
am assuming
you must be someone that was in AA for a long enough period of time that you really
experienced it first hand.

<p>
<a name="powerless2"> </a>
What I personally think is so problematic with AA and 12 Step programs is besides
the fact that they are all over the place,
they simply don't differentiate between the diversity of people or the severity of
the behavior. Not every one that drinks and gets a DUI is an alcoholic.
Not every one that gets arrested for drug possession is a drug addict. They don't
see a difference. However you come into the system, you are diseased and
powerless and if you resist these labels, you are in denial. This really is a
disservice to every one.

<p>
I like the information about Bill Wilson and smoking. Even if he considered nicotine
and caffeine minor vices, he was still powerless over addictive substances that
in the case of nicotine would eventually kill him. Why was he unable to admit his
powerlessness over cigarettes and work the steps? That's all you see today at AA
meetings are
people consuming large amounts coffee and sugar and cigarettes.

<p>
Here's my theory. If you have too much to drink it is easily observable in you
behavior. Nobody was ever pulled over for smoking too many cigarettes or committed a
crime high on tobacco.
That's why they were minor vices. But as you pointed out, if the spiritual practice
was effective in maintaining sobriety, why was it not able to control other things?

Hi Anthony,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
Starting at the top,
<ol>
<p><li>
I can be contacted, and asked questions. You just did.

<p><li>
Am I an advocate? Yes, I guess so. I am advocating sanity, and an end to
shoving quackery on sick addicts.

<p><li>
There is a list of answers to the history questions,

<p><li>
About:
<font color="black">
&quot;they simply don't differentiate between the diversity of people or the severity of
the behavior.&quot;</font>
<p>
Yes, that is it exactly. Trying to shove a standard one-size-fits-all cure on
a variety of alcohol abusers or addicts is very bad medicine. As one doctor said,
&quot;A one-size-fits-all cure is a good way to kill a lot of patients.&quot;
<p>
Insistence that there is a standard one-size-fits-all panacea is also a standard
characteristic of a cult with a simple-minded quack cure:
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_panacea" target="newwin61">71. We Have The Panacea.</a>

<p><li>
My agenda is just to get the truth out there. Too many people are getting hurt by
having an old cult religion shoved on them when they need real medical help.
And A.A., and members, cheer-leaders, shills, and 12-Step treatment centers
run an incredibly successful propaganda and publicity machine to promote
the 12-Step &quot;cure&quot;.

<p><li>
The question about why Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob couldn't use the 12-Step spiritual cure to
quit smoking is a very good question, one that the true believers tap dance away
from nervously, and try to minimize and deny.
That question reveals that the 12-Step cure for addictions does not really work.
After 10, 20, or 30 years of &quot;working the Steps&quot;, both Bill and Dr. Bob should
have been totally addiction free, spiritual and clean and serene,
not compulsive chain smokers.
<p>
We have had several discussions about that. Here are some of them:
<ol type="A">
<p><li>
 ...<a href="orange-letters95.html#Bills_tobacco" target="newwin52">all the dangers

Hi Terry,

<p>
Just found this link in the comments section after reading an article on Alternet. I
haven't researched this, so I do not know the validity. Seems they are using a drug
called Ketamine to produce a near death experience which they say may possibly cure
alcoholism (and other things). Sounds like they are attempting to produce a
spiritual experience??? Russia seems to be where they are doing the most work with
this, but looks like Yale is getting in on the action too.

<p>
A drug-induced spiritual experience??? Haven't we already experimented with this??
LSD?

<p>
Wonder what kind of cult will develop after these drug-induced near death experiences?

<p>
Possible that we got Alcoholics Anonymous out of belladonna?? Just made me wonder...

Hello Terri,
<p>
Thank you for the tip. It is not old news at all, and I had not heard of it before.

<p>
And yes, such research has been done before, especially with LSD. Either Timothy Leary
or one of his contemporaries was getting a great success rate
with treating alcoholics with LSD trips, back in the early 'sixties.
The more I think about it, I seem to recall that it was an experimental 3-day
alcoholism treatment program in Canada.
<ul>
<li> Day one was relaxation, counseling, and preparation for the trip.
<li> Day two was tripping on LSD.
<li> Day three was debriefing and counseling.
</ul>
<p>
And I recall that they had a lot of alcoholics just snap and get clean and clear
and stop drinking right then and there.
I don't know what follow-up studies were done to see how long the improvement
lasted.

<p>
Unfortunately, all such research stopped when LSD was declared illegal.

<p>
I don't know a great deal about Ketamine. I just remember that John Lilly loved
the stuff, and wrote about it in <i>Center of the Cyclone</i>.
He called it &quot;Vitamin K&quot;.

<p>
I'll check out that link.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Dear A. Orange,
<p>
 I stumbled upon your diatribe while searching alt AA
solutions. I love your rebuttals and agree, for the most part. AA made me
very sad and I do not have the confidence nor intellect to verbalize exactly
why. True, true, I was always to blame; a failure, not committed,
constitutionally incapable, ad nauseum. I still do not know the answer, you
have put into words so eloquently why AA smacked bizarre to me, raised the
hair on the back of my neck, made my stomach ache.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kyle,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
I think you do know the answer. A.A. makes you feel bad. That is just what it does
to people.
That is intentional. The goal is to weaken you and make you dependent on
the cult, so that you will think that you need A.A. for the rest of your life.
The whole thrust of the 12 Steps is to have you wallowing
in guilt and self-criticism and declarations of powerlessness and incompetence.
It even drives some people to suicide.
</font>
<p>
My only question is why AA grows and tries so hard? It is nonprofit,
correct? Perhaps human nature, we want to gather, herd and control? Four
years (hush) in AA, I met very few that had what I wanted, most could not
expand beyond the immediate &quot;home group&quot;.
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is a failure as a cure for alcohol addiction, but it is very successful
at
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#promotion" target="newwin45">self-promotion and
propaganda and spreading its goofy ideas</a>
as &quot;the truth about alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
A.A. is not entirely non-profit. Alcoholics Anonymous actually has two
corporations. The first is the book-publishing company, Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc., that makes a lot of
profits. After deductions for expenses and
<a href="orange-letters171.html#finances" target="newwin167">supporting executives in the style
to which they would like to become accustomed</a>
($70,000 to $125,000 per year, each),
the remaining profits go to the non-profit corporation, called &quot;The General
Service Organization&quot; (GSO).
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
Also, the A.A. leaders quietly reincorporated A.A.W.S. as a non-profit corporation
many years ago, which means that they don't have to pay taxes on their book sales.
</font>

<p>
But the real money is in the treatment centers. Those things charge anything from $7000
to $40,000 for a 28-day stay and course of indoctrination in the 12-Step religion.
Last year, The New York Times printed the statement that the recovery industry was
a $20 billion per year business (just in the USA). And 93% of the treatment centers
sell the 12-Step quackery. So the promoters of &quot;12-Step facilitation&quot;
have a lot of motivation to keep the scam going.
<p>
The treatment centers and the A.A. organization have a mutually helpful relationship:
The treatment centers help A.A. by routing zillions of new members
 into &quot;The Roomz&quot;,
and A.A. declares that 12-Step treatment is the only thing that works, and sends
all of the sick people to the 12-Step treatment centers.
And the employees of those treatment centers, who act as counselors or staffers,
are usually also A.A. members, &quot;in recovery&quot;, and passing on the
indoctrination that they got &#8212; <i>&quot;Freely giving away what
was freely given to us.&quot;</i>
(But $10,000 for a 28-day A.A. meeting is not &quot;free&quot;.)

<p>
The individual people who are members of the local groups have a variety of
motives. Being a part of the herd is definitely one of them.
We discussed their motives and desires a few times in the past,
<a href="orange-letters107.html#why_cult" target="newwin54">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters3.html#why_cult" target="newwin55">here</a>.
</font>

<p>
I have a cocktail after work with friends sometimes and all is fine, it is
when I have solitary time (I make sure I have plenty) when it gets
problematic.
<p>
Thank you for your article, it helped me. Plan BB??

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I plan some kind of BB or forum. I'm working on it.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	12 years wasted?<br>

<p>
Hello.

<p>
You have built an incredible treasury of knowledge here. The depth and
detail are astounding. I truly feel Bill Wilson, The Oxford groups and AA
are truly and fully debunked within this site.

<p>
Thank you SO much for your efforts. I hope this whole project has been
as cathartic for you as it has for me in only a few hours of reading.

<p>
I got sober 8/26/97, and am still sober from that date.

<p>
Often I have wondered why sometimes AA just didn't feel &quot;right&quot; and up until
tonight, had always taken it that it is due to the fact that I am not a
&quot;real alcoholic&quot; (even by AAs definition) but am a pothead instead.

<p>
I know that I do not need to remain sober to continue to improve my life. I
do know that simply being honest with myself would have eliminated 99% of
the issues I have had with substance abuse.

<p>
A bit of active work would have repaired the other &quot;character flaws&quot; I most
certainly display.

<p>
I also know that the biggest issue in my life then and now has not changed:
lack of courage and laziness. The incredible lengths I am willing to go
through to maintain my laziness is astounding to me.

<p>
I also clearly suffer from something I had never even heard a valid
description of: I am a Narcissist. Nowhere near as extreme as Bill or Bob,
but am definitely mentally ill. That is what I need to work on!

<p>
Knowing only too well how much of a sham this &quot;program&quot; is I cannot continue
being a representative. Yes, I smoked pot too often, and yes, occasionally I
drank to excess, but I am certainly no alcoholic nor addict.

<p>
I do believe that if I had some relief, some minor escape from the stresses
in my life I might not have the physical problems I now have. I also believe
I might have been able to keep a job all these years, instead of bouncing
from job to job, mostly working under the table, never paying taxes or being
part of society. I pay my bills begrudgingly and keep a roof over my head,
but having the toys I want has always been far more important to me than
paying my child support.

<p>
I have always felt a fraud and the longer I remain sober, the more I
perpetuate that myth. I have no intention of becoming a classic drunk; I
barely tolerate the taste or effect of alcohol. I do know there is a strong
chance of my being mentally dependent on marijuana, but that is a chance I
am willing to take to see if I can escape from the bondage of sobriety.

<p>
Luke F.

<p>
PS: even reading this email I see such a pattern of
self-aggrandizement...&quot;I&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot; more &quot;I&quot;...I need some help,
not to confess my sins, but to fix my issues.

<p>
Thank you, Orange!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Luke,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and thanks for the thanks.
<p>
I don't think you are a narcissist, or narcissistic. Quite the opposite,
you are too down on yourself. You criticize yourself far too much, and
you find fault with yourself too much. And, alas, you have a low opinion
of yourself.
All of those years of &quot;searching and fearless moral inventories&quot; have taken
their toll.
<p>
By the way, real narcissists cannot stand criticism. They will defend themselves endlessly,
and explain why you are wrong if you dare to criticize them, and often counter-attack
viciously when criticized.
What Bill Wilson called &quot;emotional benders&quot; was him throwing
screaming temper tantrums, to overpower critics who disagreed with him,
and get his own way. You aren't doing that.

<p>
The first thing that I would suggest is actually seeing a real doctor and
find out if you are really mentally ill. I doubt that you are, but get it
checked out.
And if you do have a problem, it is possible that some medication might help.
But that's up to the doctor.
<p>
Then, I suggest getting out of the rooms and getting involved
in some do-good social activity. You could volunteer at some place that helps homeless
people, or helps the elderly, like Meals on Wheels. Or builds houses for the poor,
like Habitat for Humanity.  Or just helps with any good cause.
Plant trees and improve the environment. Pick up the trash in public spaces.
Whatever. Take your pick.
<p>
The idea is, when you get busy helping others in simple and sane ways,
that will turn your attention away from yourself, and you won't have so much
time to criticize yourself.
And then you will eventually discover that you are pretty good, not such
a terrible narcissist after all.
<p>
By the way, thinking a good thought about yourself now and then,
and wanting to think of yourself as a good person, is not narcissism.
That behavior is called &quot;being normal&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I am writing to thank you.

<p>
Today I saw a commercial about the Hallmark movie, &quot;When Love is Not Enough&quot;
(The Lois Wilson story) and for some reason currently unknown to me, I
Googled &quot;Did Bill Wilson cheat on Lois Wilson&quot; and your site was the very
first one that came up in the Google results.  I had no idea what lay ahead
of me and how it would impact my views about my AA membership.

<p>
I appreciate your dedication and passion about the subject.  Frankly, I've
never seen a website as detailed and informative as yours, subject matter
notwithstanding.  I am interested to know if you were ever a member of AA &#8212; 
your knowledge is so in depth, it really is amazing.  Or are you a
therapist?  What prompted you to start the site.  I'm very interested in
learning more.

<p>
My Background:  I have been a member of AA since April 2002.  I have never
had a drink of alcohol or a drug since my very first meeting.  I was 25
years old in 2002.  I just collected my 8 year coin earlier this month.  I'm
also college educated Political Science major and worked the majority of my
adult life in the legal field; I've not belonged to a &quot;religious
affiliation&quot; until recently (now I am a member of the Unity Movement) and
was a self-proclaimed agnostic when I entered AA in 2002; Therefore,
questioning and critical thinking is a tenant of my life.  I do not have a
desire to use or drink for the rest of my life.  I feel as if I'm done with
that part of my life.

<p>
While I am not sure where what I will ultimately choose to do long term with
respect to my involvement in AA, I sincerely appreciate you making the
information available to people.  I attended a meeting after reading through
your site and it just wasn't the same.  I do not know if I can ever have
faith in the program again.

<p>
Seek and Ye Shall Find (as they say),<br>
Thanks again,<br>
Emily<br>

<p>
P.S.  Also, I have some items you might like for your archives &#8212; what
address should I send them to?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Emily,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations on your 8 years
of sobriety. That is good.

<p>
Yes, I went to a bunch of A.A. and N.A. meetings, once upon a time.
That history, and the answers to a lot of your questions, are to be found
<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="newwin50">here</a>.

<p>
I am not a therapist, although I keep getting questions that make me wish
I had a lot more knowledge along those lines.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

Just read your article and hip-hip-hooray!! I am an AA member, sober for
42 years and I want to thank you! You have no idea of the number of people
who think Bill W. actually saw god. If you tell them he was hallucinating
they look at you as if you have two heads. I am an Atheist/Humanist and
have no sky god. I work hard at helping others that come into AA very
confused and questioning. I tried to tell an ex-priest that I had no faith in
my self and my spirit was broken. AA fixed that along with the not drinking
thing without prayer and god. It was simply the love of people in the
fellowship, their sharing of their experience along with the 12 Steps as I
understood them. You are the first written article that I have seen that
takes apart the god bit and I appreciate it.
<p>
Thank  you so much.<br>

Subject:  	Re: AA and Religious Faith<br>

<p>
Hey Orange!  As a female, mother of seven, nationally known artist
(retired), grandmother of 8, I do not qualify for your Rescue League!   Well,
perhaps, but very part time!

<p>
I was interested in your comments on self examination, confession  etc.

<p>
On self examination, if my actions cause me extreme discomfort I perhaps
might want a pain reliever.  Hence the discovery of said actions, or
actually reactions, might be a good thing to understand and stop.  Try  another
action or reaction.

<p>
My understanding of your &quot;confession&quot; is pretty simple.  I grew up  with
the idea of &quot;what people do not know, cannot hurt you!&quot;  Today I have  come to
the conclusion that people cannot identify with perfection.  You  cannot
really like people you do not know either.  So in allowing people to  know
your imperfection you allow them to be part of your life.  In knowing  others
imperfections and liking them anyway allows you to like yourself with  your
own imperfections.

<p>
I do not look at &quot;spirituality&quot; as connected to Religion.  I look at  it as
they way one lives their life.  Religion has to do with the &quot;life  after
death,&quot; and spirituality has to do with &quot;today&quot;.  If you could prove  to the
world beyond a shadow of a doubt there was no heaven or hell religion  would
be a thing of the past.  It is their hook and yes, based on  fear.

<p>
At 73 years of age (in 4 days) I have a usefulness beyond grand kids, civic
duties, bridge clubs etc.  I took a young woman to 4 meetings because she
has a seizure disorder and cannot drive right now.  At one of the meetings
a lady told of her 22 year old daughter committing suicide on Mothers Day.
I was able to share my own experience with her (my parents suicide the day
after  Thanksgiving l957) and also share that in the following 10 years of
drinking  there was no healing, but that after a short period (18 mos.) in
AA I had healed  from that trauma.  You see our past experience becomes a
useful tool to  help others.

<p>
According to the dictionary, AA does fit the word &quot;Cult.&quot;  All I know  is
that it is the most positive &quot;cult&quot; I have ever known.  It does save  peoples
lives, returns self esteem, and helps fulfill our two basic  psychological
needs--to be useful to ourselves and others and to be able to give  and
receive love.  Not bad for a Cult or Fellowship, or what ever you wish  to call
it.

<p>
When my husband became ill with Lewy Body Disease I had to stop my art work
and care for him. That was an eight year stint.  And yes, my  friends in
AA were my support group.  There was no support group for  Lewy Body Disease
at the time and the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's  Support  groups were
useless to me.
<p>
They met once a month and I was dealing with a disintegrating man  every
day.  The last 18 months one of his AA Sponsee's came every Monday so  I could
get to my noon meeting and have lunch with friends.  One of my AA
Sponsee's found me a part time nurse so I could have 5 hours to myself 3  times a
week. My neighbors of 23 years did not even know his  name.

<p>
There is a purpose for AA and/or any other group that helps people get
their life back in order.  Cut them some slack.

<p>
Sincerely,  Penny

Hello Penny,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You know, it good that you have some nice people in your A.A. group who
treated you decently and gave you some moral support when your husband was sick.

What is missing from your letter is any evidence that A.A. actually causes
people to quit drinking alcohol.

Hi Bobby,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Let me guess: The TV program that you saw must have been the Hallmark movie about Lois Wilson,
<i>&quot;When Love is Not Enough&quot;</i>. (I knew it was coming.)
<p>
Well, I will answer the question for you:
I am right and they are lying. I can say that with confidence even though
I have not even seen that program yet.
<p>
This is nothing new. The previous Hallmark movie about Alcoholics Anonymous,
<i>&quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;</i>, was also a total work of fiction, a real
white-wash, and a deliberate lie.

<p>
William Borchert, who wrote the screen play for <i>&quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;</i>,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Borchert" target="newwin773">hid a whole lot
of facts, and falsified others</a>,
and changed a lot of history, and just lied a lot.
<ul>
<p><li>
Borchert carefully avoided mentioning the unpleasant fact that
<a href="orange-rroot780.html" target="newwin780">Bill Wilson was tripping his brains out
on hallucinogenic drugs when he &quot;saw God&quot;</a> in Charlie Towns' Hospital
in 1934.

<p><li>
Borchert also falsified the story of Bill Wilson in the Mayflower Hotel in
Akron in 1935, struggling to choose between the angel and the devil &#8212;
that is, having to choose between calling a Christian minister, or going
to the bar for a drink. Look
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Mayflower" target="newwin739">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters57.html#Tunks" target="newwin733">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters58.html#Mayflower" target="newwin734">here</a>.

<p><li>
And Borchert totally covered up the fact that
<a href="orange-rroot810.html" target="newwin810">Bill and Dr. Bob were actually
recruiting new members for Frank Buchman's pro-Nazi cult religion in Akron</a>.
Bill and Bob were not going around Akron and learning how to recruit alcoholics
for Alcoholics Anonymous. There wasn't any such thing as A.A. then,
and they did not start A.A. then.
They recruited new members for Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult religion,
using the standard Oxford Group recruiting techniques, and then
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="newwin798">Dr. Bob demanded
that the new recruits &quot;surrender to God&quot; on their knees before him</a>.
Both Bill and Bob fervently believed that Frank Buchman's style of religion
was the cure for alcoholism.

<p><li>
And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin820">Bill and Bob's
 new &quot;sobriety club&quot; did not have a good success rate, either</a>.
They only got a 5% success rate, which is just the same as
the normal rate of spontaneous remission
in alcoholics. But you will never learn that from the movie.

<p><li>
Borchert also didn't bother to mention the fact that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="newwin822">Bill Wilson was a sexual
predator who used A.A. meetings as meat markets</a>.

<p><li>
Borchert also avoided mentioning the fact that Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#stock_broker" target="newwin825">really a failed
Wall Street hustler &#8212; not a stock broker at all</a>.

<p><li>
Borchert also covered up the facts that Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="newwin832">a felonious embezzler</a>,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock2" target="newwin842">a stock swindler</a>,
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="newwin852">a narcissistic pathological liar</a>.

</ul>

<p>
That whole Hallmark movie was just more cult propaganda.
And now they have done the sequel to that piece of garbage.

<p>
The big question in my mind is, &quot;Is the president of the Hallmark card company
really a secret member of Alcoholics Anonymous? Why is Hallmark so eager to
glorify and promote a lying cult religion?&quot; I smell a rat.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Philipp M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Hi orange<br>

<p>
Hi,
I just read your website and I'm a mazed at how much information you have gathered
on the AA history.
<p>
Very interesting.
<p>
I have one question for you. Do you believe in God and spirituality?
<p>
It sounds like it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Philipp,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the question.  The simple answer is, &quot;Yes, I am not an atheist.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Here you write:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Please note that none of those means gives you any guarantees at all; most of the
time, none of them, including drugs, really works for getting a spiritual
experience. It takes a lot more than just an exercise or a dose to produce such an
experience. The person's mind set is critically important, and setting is probably
critical too. &quot;Mind set&quot; may include years of preparation, or even a lifetime of
accumulated karma. (Some people would say &quot;many lifetimes.&quot;) And then there just
seems to be an element of luck. (Or, if you don't like the word &quot;luck&quot;, then maybe
cosmic good fortune, or good karma, or grace, or something.) Anyway, when it
happens, it is great.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So does that mean in your opinion that there is such a thing as god and as
spirituality?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>
And if so, I dont; really undeerstand the point of your criticism of AA on yoru
website.

<p>
If God and spirit exists and if it helps alcoholics to get sober , than what is
wrong with AA?
<p>
If God really exists, shouldn't everyone who has the opportunity how to be in
contact with him be lucky?
<p>
You say that there is a way to get in touch with god through meditation or &quot;karma&quot;,
but then you say that it's ridiculous to say in the big book that we should be in
touch with god at all times and carry out his will for us.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What is wrong with A.A.? Well,
<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="newwin323">here is the list</a>.
<p>
Yes, God exists (whatever God really is), but there is no reason to believe that God
haunts A.A. meeting rooms. If I were God, I'd say,
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 &quot;No way am I going to be associated
with that mess of deceit and heresy. Sexually exploiting underage girls? Telling lies
to newcomers? Telling sick people not to take their medications? Go to Hell.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And it is ridiculous to imagine that &quot;we should be in
touch with god at all times&quot;. That was one of the big problems with the Oxford Group,
which Bill Wilson copied. All that A.A. is doing is repeating the mistakes of Dr. Frank
Buchman.
<p>
A contemporary minister criticized the Oxford Group superstitions like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Groupists actually speak of 'listening-in' to the Holy Ghost:
whenever they run up against a difficulty they stop for guidance.
Such an idea of God is crudely anthropomorphic, derogatory to God's honor,
and contrary to natural morality.... Guidance as understood by the Groups
encourages all kinds of illusions; it undermines the sense of personal
moral responsibility, it leads to fanaticism.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The Rt. Revd. M. J. Browne, Bishop of Galway, in his Catholic Truth Society
Pamphlet, quoted in<br>
<i>The Mystery of Moral Re-Armament</i>, by Tom Driberg,
New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1965, pages 195-196.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham, said in his
criticism of the Oxford Groups:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Groupism discloses in its conception of 'Guidance' precisely the same error
as that which infects its conception of 'witness'.
<font color="#9F0000">
It 'seeks a sign'.
</font>
It insists on something precise, concrete, calculable.
Its temper of mind is
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Pharisees" target="newwin229">rather Pharisaic than Christian</a>.
It seeks proofs of Divine action in what is abnormal, amazing, even miraculous.
Its view of inspiration is mechanical, and its treatment of Scripture
literalist. Thus it comes about that, even in the process of exalting
the genuinely Christian conception of the 'guided life', it perverts
and lowers it.<br>

Of His Diocese Together With An Introduction</i>, Herbert Hensley Henson, D.D.,

</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here is another instance of the shallowness of thought and extremes
of teaching of which the Group must be held guilty.<br>
...<br>
... If <i>every</i> passing thought is to be followed as Guidance,
and <i>every</i> coincidence regarded as a Divine intervention,
where are we to stop this side madness?
Dr. Buchman has no authority whatever for his doctrine
of direct guidance available at any moment.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The &quot;Quiet Time&quot; encourages introspection: the pseudo-guidance
is its result. Minds deranged, homes made tragic, careers broken, bitter
disappointment following the unhappy or negative outcome of this
so-called guidance &#8212; these are the consequences.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I would sum up in the words of <i>The [London] Times</i>:
&quot;It must be the most serious charge against the Groups that they
encourage their members to shirk the discipline of thought in
favour of impulses received from they know not where.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The teaching on Guidance is as great a superstition as any purged
from the Church at the Reformation.<br>

</font>
<p>
I'm just curious to see you opinion on this,...

<p>
&quot;Either god is or he isn't&quot;
So if he is, as you claim. Then what is all your criticism all about.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The fact that God exists does not mean that God &quot;works the Steps&quot;, or approves of
the strange superstitions of Alcoholics Anonymous.
The 12 Steps are the words of Dr. Frank Buchman, not the Word Of God.

</font>
<br>
<a name="millions"> </a>
<p>
Nobody says AA invented anything new. In fact it is based on first century
christianity and nobody claims anything else.
<p>
However no other movement has spread worldwide and helped millions of alcoholics and
addicts to completely recover and turn their lives around and the lives of family
and friends around them,...
<p>
The way AA is constructed is new in the sum of it's parts and has proven to work for
everyone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, actually A.A. theology is not based on &quot;First Century Christianity&quot;. Not at all.
Dr. Frank Buchman made up that name and claimed that his cult was practicing First
Century Christian Fellowship, but it wasn't.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is based entirely on the heretical teachings of Frank Buchman.
Please read
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin234">The Religious Roots of A.A.
 and the Twelve Steps</a>,
and also
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="newwin236">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.
<p>
And your last line is
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_denial" target="newwin118">a complete reversal of reality</a>:
<font color="black">
&quot;The way AA is constructed is new in the sum of it's parts and has proven to work for
everyone.&quot;
</font>
<p>
No, actually, A.A. is a proven failure.
A.A. has no better a success rate than no treatment or &quot;help&quot; at all.
Alcoholics who quit drinking alone do just as well, and die less, and commit suicide less.

</font>
<p>
So what is your point really?

<p>
Do you have another &quot;cure&quot; for alcoholism, addiction and the many diseases that are
cured with spiritual principles?
<p>
Is medication and therapy really helping with drug addiction and alcoholism,
gambling, sex addiction, overeating and such?

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a funny question. Since when are <i>&quot;alcoholism, addiction and ... many diseases ...
cured with spiritual principles&quot;</i>? They aren't.
That is pure quackery. That is what is wrong with Alcoholics Anonymous.
They foist a hocus-pocus superstitious &quot;cure&quot; on sick people.
<p>
&#8212;And then, when the &quot;cure&quot; fails, they have the gall
to declare that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;There is no cure. We only get a one-day reprieve from our
 death sentence.&quot;</i></font><br>
It is a bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#a_cure" target="newwin225">First, a cure, and then, no cure</a>.
<p>
And then they will say:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Besides, it's all your own fault that the 12 Steps didn't work, because you didn't
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="newwin721"><i>really try</i></a>
and you didn't
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#thoroughly_follow" target="newwin722">

and you didn't
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="newwin725">

and you were
<a href="orange-not_good.html#born_that_way" target="newwin724"><i>born that way</i></a>.&quot;
</font>

<p>
There are much better ways to treat alcohol abuse, drug and alcohol addictions, and other
problems like compulsive gambling and sexual addiction.
<p>
For starters, look here at this list of treatments for alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320082606/http://www.behaviortherapy.com/ResearchDiv/whatworks.aspx" target="newwin226">
http://www.behaviortherapy.com/ResearchDiv/whatworks.aspx</a><br>
== Statistics on the success rates of various treatment programs.<br>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.<br>
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.
<p>
Also see:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320082606/http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/53/1/What-works-A-summary-of-alcohol-treatment-research/Page1.html" target="newwin227">
http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/53/1/What-works-A-summary-of-alcohol-treatment-research/Page1.html</a><br>
== The same statistics in a different format.
<p>
Then you can read about the actual tests of A.A. treatment of alcoholics which showed
that A.A. made things worse, not better:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="newwin118">The Effectiveness
of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>

<p>
Then, as alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous,
there are things like SMART, SOS, Lifering, and WFS, all of which are better than A.A.
I just posted the whole list of them again, so I'll just point you
to the list,
<a href="orange-letters161.html#alt_list" target="newwin174">here</a>.

</font>
<p>
if so it would be curious to see that on your page as well with the exact medication
listed and the exact medical and psychiological procedures.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Consult the previous links. In their web sites, SMART, Lifering, and SOS
describe themselves and their methods in detail, so I will let them speak
for themselves. The list that rates treatments also
contains links to descriptions, and then you can look up other treatments with Wikipedia.
</font>
<p>
Thank you if you are willing to respond and if not
I wish you a great week and keep up the good work.

<p>
Best,

<p>
Philipp

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the good wishes, Philipp, and you have a good day too.
And good luck with your recovery.

From:  	crlfunk<br>
Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
If you don't believe in AA, that is your right, but you don't have to try to
convince others that it is a sham, and dash the hopes of someone who can benefit
from it. What ever prompted you to be so hateful?  Do you realize how much time you
have wasted on negativity?  Have you never heard of doing something &quot;productive&quot;?
Apparently not.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello &quot;crlfunk&quot;,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12-Step treatment centers push quack medicine on sick
people, and even cause some of them to die. That is why I criticize A.A. and its
&quot;program&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Have you gone through one of the 12 step programs? I have, and my life and health
changed dramatically for the better.  I have found in the organization nothing of
what you describe.  I know many in the organization that have benefited and grown
spiritually.  Have you ever talked to people that have had a positive experience in
a 12-step program?  It shouldn't be hard.  There are thousands out there.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have not done the 12 Steps, nor will I ever do them.
I also have not gotten my mind &quot;audited&quot;
by Scientology, and I haven't done the practices of the Moonies, or Hari Krishnas,
or any other cult, either. I also don't drink cyanide koolaid.
The reason that I don't do those things is because I can look at what happened to
other people who did them, and were hurt by them.
<p>
I have talked to many people who claim to have had positive experiences from
doing the 12 Steps.
<a href="orange-letters.html" target="newwin225">Read the letters that I get</a>.
And I find that invariably,
the A.A. boosters don't know how to determine if a cause-and-effect relationship
exists between doing Frank Buchman's Oxford Group practices and happy sobriety.
</font>

<p>
People do drink, drug, and eat over negative emotions.  When we figure out what is
causing the negativity and work to deal with our problems, we don't have to abuse
substances because we don't have the negative emotions to drive us to.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But A.A. causes lots more negative emotions, with all of the
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step4" target="newwin236">guilt induction and
fault-finding and confessions</a>,
and teaching that
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="226">you are powerless over alcohol</a>
and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="224">a disgusting sinner</a>.
<p>
And, actually, &quot;negative emotions&quot; are not the cause of alcohol abuse and
alcohol addiction.
That is a typical cultish simple-minded answer to a complex problem,
the belief that there is a
&quot;<a href="orange-letters36.html#panmalefic" target="newwin235">panmalefic</a>&quot;
&#8212; one simple cause of all of your problems.
Some people do drink because they are trying to drown out some negative emotions,
but some other people drink because they have mental illnesses, like a Bipolar condition &#8212;
which used to be called &quot;manic-depressive&quot; &#8212; and they drink to try to slow down
the mania, or to cheer up the depression.  Other people drink because they want
an ecstatic rush. And some people drink because they are schizophrenic.
And other people drink because they are sick and dying and in pain from some other
disease (including tobacco addiction).
That's why it is good to have a real doctor, not an A.A. sponsor with quack medical opinions,
diagnosing alcoholics.
</font>

<p>
Actually, you could benefit from a 12 step program to work on your negativity,
anger, resentment, lies, grandiosity, and anger to mention a few.  Am I analyzing
you?  I don't have to.  Your character defects come across clear and strong in your
writing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Objecting to quacks foisting a fraud on sick people is not a character defect that
needs to be fixed.
<p>
<i>NOT</i> objecting to such fraud and quackery is a defect of character that needs
to be fixed. So what is wrong with you, and why don't you fix it?
<p>
And your rap about &quot;negativity&quot; and negative emotions is ridiculous.
You keep using that term &#8212; 5 times now.
Here in the real world, we don't have to just &quot;be positive&quot;
all of the time. Criticizing bad things is a good thing to do.
I suppose if you had been there in Jonestown when they were handing out the
cyanide-laced Flavoraid, you would have said to the people around you who were
crying and moaning,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Hey! Don't be so negative! Cyanide is good for you. Besides,
we are all going to Heaven!&quot;</font>
</font>

<p>
Why don't you find something worthwhile to spend your time on, like maybe doing some
volunteer work?  Of course, you may use it as a channel to spread your poison and
bitterness.

<p>
I will say a prayer for you, because I feel sorry for your hatred, and just because
it is the right thing to do..

<p>
p.s.  I bet you don't go to church!  That also comes across clearly in your writing
as well.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And there you have revealed everything that needs to be said.
Alcoholics Anonymous is just a two-bit religion that cannot tolerate one bit of criticism.
<p>
Of course, the success or failure rate of the goofy Alcoholics Anonymous
&quot;cure&quot; or &quot;solution&quot; is not affected or changed by my
going or not going to some church or other.
That rap is just another lame 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="newwin237"><i>ad hominem</i></a>
attack that is intended to 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert" target="newwin238">divert attention</a>
from the real problem &#8212; that A.A. does not work to make alcoholics quit drinking.
<p>
When you say that my writing reveals that I don't go to church, what you really
mean is that I have the irritating habit of telling the truth and criticizing lies
&#8212; I don't talk like a brainwashed believer.
Well thank you for the compliment.
<p>
Have a good day.
