<i>Use of the Cognitive Dissonance Technique.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Behavior, attitudes, beliefs, thoughts, and feelings are interconnected,
and people want to keep them all in harmony. If you force a change in one,
it will cause a change in the others. For example, if you force a
change in behavior, it will cause a change in attitudes, thoughts, and beliefs.<br>

<a name="Rafalovich"> </a>

Adam Rafalovich wrote an exemplary piece of pseudo-intellectual
bull that attempted to posit that Narcotics Anonymous meetings actually
work and have positive effects on ex-addicts. It clearly demonstrated the
effective use of cognitive dissonance techniques on newcomers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Embedded within the interplay of these moments of recovering-addict
identity is a technique of identity transformation I refer to as
false working. False working denotes a mechanism by which NA members
are given permission to &quot;act as if&quot; they truly believe
in the NA
message regardless of their real sentiments. This technique is
exemplified by the aphorism <i>Fake it 'til you make it.</i>
False working
proves to be a crucial component for the NA organization to maintain
long-term membership and recruit new, skeptical members.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Keep coming back! Narcotics Anonymous narrative
and recovering-addict identity</i>, Adam Rafalovich,
<i>Contemporary Drug Problems</i>, Spring 1999, v26, i1, p131.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, lie and fake it and pretend to be getting great
results from <i>&quot;working the program&quot;</i>,
to fool the newcomers into believing
that the voodoo medicine routine really works.
Such deceit is useful for what the author calls
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_cloning">identity
transformation</a>&quot; &#8212; converting newcomers into good cult members.
Note that the author says that such deceit and fakery is even
&quot;a crucial component&quot; in keeping the old-timers coming back.
So everybody is deceiving everybody else, all of the time.
Everybody is re-enacting <i>&quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot;</i>.

<p>
Note the stilted language and disguised euphemisms.
Instead of saying, &quot;deception and deceit&quot;, the author uses
the more scholarly-sounding phrases, <i>&quot;false working&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;permission to 'act as if' they truly believe in the
NA message&quot;</i>.
<p>
Rafalovich continued:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Standing most significant in the literature today is the
concept of
narrative and its effect in creating group cohesion inside and
outside 12-step meetings.
It is believed in the study of 12-step recovery processes that the
mutual disclosures of members fosters processes of belonging and
commitment to the collective goal of drug and alcohol
abstinence. &nbsp; ...<br>
In addition, the study of story presentation has been shown to be
integral in developing moral attachments to a collectivity.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Keep coming back! Narcotics Anonymous narrative

</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, use the standard cult recruiting technique of
<i><a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_testimonies">Personal Testimonies
of Earlier Converts</a></i>
to change the thinking of the newcomers and suck them into the cult.
Much of the &quot;sharing&quot; is just sales pitches telling
newcomers to join the group and <i>Keep Coming Back</i>.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;By examining the contents of common NA testimony, we can examine
data that demonstrate that individual action is as much a result of
the NA organization as it is a contributor to it. Therefore when
positing a theory of the recovering-addict identity process, it is
important to acknowledge the internalization of an organization as
a result of becoming a contributor. Interestingly, NA members
realize this theoretical notion. Contribution, for example, is a
strong ethic within the organization; it is believed that to not
participate in the narrative environment (i.e., not share during
meetings) will harm one's chances of continued abstinence.&quot;<br>
</font>

and recovering-addict identity</i>, Adam Rafalovich,

<p>
In other words, the way to become one of the group is to start
talking the talk in meetings, and telling people that the program
<i>really is</i> working for you &#8212;

<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Fake It Until You Make It.&quot; &#8212;
&quot;You can act yourself into thinking right easier than you can think yourself into acting right.&quot;
</i></font>
The more you do it, the more it will warp your
thinking and make you feel and act like one of the old-timers.
Since you don't want to think of yourself as a lying fake, you will start to imagine that
you <i>really are</i> getting some great results, just like you have been saying...
<p>
It's called <i>cognitive dissonance</i>. You will feel a conflict between
the requirement to talk like the program works and your knowledge that it isn't
doing anything. The feeling is one of <i>dissonance</i> &#8212; the same irritating,
jarring, disharmonious feeling that you get from bad musical chords.
<p>
Your subconscious mind will struggle to minimize the pain of the conflict
between believing that it is wrong to lie, and the group requirement
that you say that you are getting great results from working the program &#8212; and
the subconscious mind's answer to the problem is to
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;come to believe&quot;</i></font>
that the program really <i>is</i> working for you and that you <i>really are</i> making
great spiritual progress from working a strong program, just like you've been saying.
<p>
It's really a very common brainwashing and mind-control technique:
<font color="blue">
&quot;Makem' say it enough times, and they'll start to believe it.
Make them go through the motions enough times and they will start to believe that such
behavior is normal.&quot;
</font>

<p><li> An enthusiastic A.A. missionary grandly declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I believe that in a hundred years historians will look back and
pinpoint this milestone as
<font color="#9F0000">
the single most important event in the
twentieth century</font>.
This milestone was the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous
in Akron, Ohio, in June of 1935.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides the invaluable gift of sobriety that AA has given to millions
of Alcoholics, it also started a revolution in Spiritual consciousness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The dramatic success and expansion of AA facilitated the spread of a
radically revolutionary idea which has traditionally, in Western Civilization,
been considered heresy. This was not a new idea but rather a reintroduction
and clarification of an old idea, coupled with a formula for practical
application of the concept into day-to-day human life experience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This revolutionary idea was that an unconditionally Loving Higher Power
exists with whom the individual being can personally communicate.
A Higher Power that is so powerful that it has no need to judge the
humans it created because this Universal Force is powerful enough to
ensure that everything unfolds perfectly from a Cosmic Perspective.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I Truly do believe that the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous could
be viewed as
<font color="#9F0000">
the most important single event of the Twentieth Century</font>.
That is because the twelve step recovery program has not only proven
such a literal life saver for millions of people, but it also provided
a formula for countless individuals to learn how to live life based upon
spiritual principles that align with the metaphysical laws that actually
govern the experience of being human - instead of the twisted black and
white beliefs of shame based organized religion.<br>

They just don't do this in regular meetings.

<p>
But the institutional version of A.A., where they run detox
centers and treatment centers, and
take prisoners, scores a 10. They do almost everything in the
brainwashing book to convert people
to the A.A. religion: total immersion; isolation from outside
contacts; restricted reading materials (the
Bible and A.A. literature); constant meetings and
&quot;group therapy&quot;
sessions, which are just more A.A.
meetings by a different name;
confession and self-criticism sessions,
making people learn and constantly
repeat A.A. dogma and slogans as
the answer for alcoholism; the use of drugs to make people more
cooperative and amenable to
conversion; the use of other patients as snitches to inform on
those who are bad-rapping the program
behind the counselors' backs; and the punishment of dissenters by
a variety of means, including
putting them in the &quot;hot seat&quot; and
shaming or bullying them for hours...

<p>
The counselors and therapists are quite open about the goal
of this treatment being to forcefully
convert people to a new belief system, the A.A. system. They
rationalize it by saying that it will save
the patients' lives. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why A.A.
true believers over-react when someone
says that the Twelve Steps don't work &#8212; if they don't, then this
abusive behavior is unjustifiable.

<i>Threats of bodily harm or death to someone who leaves the group.</i></b></font><br>
The street version of A.A. scores a 5.<br>
<p>
A.A. does not threaten to assassinate dropouts and defectors.
People leave every day, almost everybody leaves, which creates A.A.'s
abysmally low retention rate, and no one threatens them.
A.A.'s own literature says that the specter of
John Barleycorn threatening sickness,
insanity, and death does far more to enforce the A.A. rules than
anything A.A. could ever do.

<p>
But leaving may not be totally without consequences.
The <i>Big Book</i> hints that your
sponsor is not supposed to blab your most embarrassing personal secrets
all over town after you do your Fifth Step and confess everything to him or her, but
they've been known to do it anyway. Some sponsors did it
to punish people who dared to leave A.A..
<font size="-1">(See: <i>A.A. Horror Stories</i>, Rebecca Fransway, pages
116, 139, and 232.)</font>

<p>
And ostracism is another usual consequence.
Your A.A. &quot;true friends for life&quot; will
suddenly not like you any more if you stop going to meetings.
<p>
The really intense A.A. death threats are the often-repeated claims that people who quit A.A.
will relapse and die drunk in a gutter, or go insane, or become a
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">Dry Drunk</a>&quot;.
A.A. has lots of slogans like:

<ul>
<li> &quot;You must <i>Work A Strong Program</i>, or else your fate will be <i>Jails, Institutions, or Death</i>.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you drink, your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you leave A.A., your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;
<li> &quot;I've been in jails; I've been in institutions; there's only one more place to go.&quot;
<li> &quot;The bottle, big house, or the box.&quot;
<li> &quot;Death, insanity, or recovery.&quot;
<li> &quot;Always remember the insanity... Be thankful for the pain... But most of all be thankful for the days that remain.&quot;
<li> &quot;The choice I have today is either to be Contented or Demented.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's Bill's way or the you'll get killed way.&quot;

<p>
Institutional A.A. is another story entirely. When people
are forced to attend A.A. meetings by
a treatment program, an E.A.P. (Employee Assistance Program),
a judge, or a parole officer, there are very
real negative consequences for leaving
A.A., for not attending meetings, or for not
performing satisfactorily
in &quot;group therapy&quot;.
<ul>
<li> Homeless people who are housed in shelters while in
treatment programs face a return to being homeless
in the streets for not going to 12-step meetings.
<li> Employees who were sent by an E.A.P. face loss of their
jobs for failure to complete the program.
<li> Those sent by a judge or parole officer face jail
or prison for leaving or unsatisfactory performance.

<li> Other people, like lawyers or doctors, are often forced into
A.A. by their professional societies' diversion programs, and
their only choices are attending many dreary meetings and yammering
a lot of cult slogans,
or professional decertification, which destroys their career.

<li> See the next item, threats for criticizing, for even
worse examples, like death threats.

<p>
The meetings themselves aren't too bad. People are strongly
discouraged from criticizing the
program during meetings, but not threatened.
<p>
However, people who publish negative reports on A.A.,
or who openly, publicly, question A.A. dogma, or who publish
medical or scientific papers challenging
the effectiveness of A.A. treatment or its principles, face all
kinds of sanctions: loss of reputation, loss
of employment, being black-balled from the treatment industry,
and being blocked from further publishing or speaking.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160527044108/http://www.schaler.net/fifth/cultbusting.html">Dr. Jeffrey Schaler</a>,
for example, lost his teaching position at Chestnut Hill College
when he published his book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Schaler"><i>Addiction is a Choice</i></a>
that only mildly criticized the beliefs and tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<li>
When the husband-and-wife team of Mark Sobell and Linda Sobell published their work
on teaching moderate controlled drinking to alcoholics, they were so
villified by the A.A. pundits that they had to move to Canada to continue
their research. (See: Sobell, M. B., and L. C. Sobell. 1973. &quot;Alcoholics Treated by
Individualized Behavior Therapy: One Year Treatment Outcome.&quot;
<i>Behavior Research and Therapy</i> 11:599-618.)

<li>
Hospitals with inpatient treatment programs that included non-12-Step modalities
have found themselves blackmailed by the local A.A. organizations into dropping
the non-12-Step programs, or else A.A.-dominated organizations and clinics
would not refer any more patients to that hospital.
</ul>

<p>
A.A. members will launch vicious smear
campaigns to discredit and destroy
their critics, while hiding their A.A. membership. A.A. will use its
front organizations like
ASAM (the American Society of Addiction Medicine),
NCADD (the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence), and NAADAC (the National Association of Alcoholism
and Drug Abuse Counselors),
and also its immense network of addiction treatment
professionals, to attack the critics,
while they all hide their A.A. memberships.
<p>
A.A. practices blackmail: They threaten to involve any
organization that publishes negative information about A.A. or its
treatment program in such shrill
controversy that most of them feel that it just isn't worth the
bother to open that can of worms. They
have even blackmailed hospitals that were starting alternative
treatment programs, like teaching
controlled drinking, by threatening to stop referring patients to
the hospital's lucrative inpatient
treatment program.

<a name="force_Kirton"> </a>
<p>
And institutional A.A. is even worse. Institutionalized
people who refuse to be indoctrinated into
believing in A.A., or the Twelve Steps, or the disease model of
alcoholism, and who criticize those
things, face threats like: 1) Incarceration until the
insurance money runs out, with endless
&quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;group therapy&quot; sessions where
they are bullied, browbeat, and shamed, or 2) Expulsion
from the treatment program, which may cause violation of
probation and reincarceration in a prison,
or job loss or professional decertification for failure to
complete the program, or great financial
expense &#8212; some health insurance plans make the patient pay for
the full course of alcoholism
treatment if he doesn't complete the program.

<p>
<a name="no_transplant"> </a>
In extreme cases, like when A.A. members run organ transplant
centers, the threat is death. Dr.
Clifton Kirton reports that when he needed a liver transplant,
and resisted A.A. indoctrination, and said
that he felt that A.A. was a coercive religious cult with medically
incorrect dogma, he was told:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;If you think that's what Alcoholics Anonymous is all about,
you're really missing the point. Religion has nothing to do
with it. Your higher power can be anything. You are not
being coerced. Your participation in A.A. is entirely
voluntary. I must caution you, however, that your failure to
internalize recovery concepts will place your transplant
candidacy status in great jeopardy.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(In other words, join A.A. or die.
&quot;Voluntarily&quot;, of course. Dr. Kirton continued:)
</font>
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
These statements were made by Judy Stowe, Certified
Chemical Dependency Counselor and coordinator of the
Organ Transplant Chemical Dependency Unit at The
Cleveland Clinic, an internationally respected tertiary care
facility. The fact that the 12 steppers have achieved high
status at such a prestigious medical center emphasizes
the scope of the cult's influence at the highest levels.
It is of further crucial importance that, according to Ms. Stowe,
chemical dependency &quot;rehabilitation&quot; is mandated by the
state of Ohio, although she refused to provide anything to
this effect in writing.<br>

A.A. scores 0 again.<br>
<p>
A.A. passes the hat at each meeting, and that's all. Since many
people come into A.A. in ragged shape,
fresh out of detox, unemployed and penniless, nobody thinks twice
about someone who doesn't donate.
A.A. even has a seldom-mentioned rule of thumb to the effect of
&quot;you aren't supposed to donate more
than $1000 per year when the basket is passed around.&quot;

<p>
The situation with institutional A.A. is becoming suspicious,
however. Institutional A.A. is
usually happy to just suck up people's health insurance money
until it is exhausted, but there are
stories of people having to sell their homes and give the money
to the treatment center to keep
running Daddy or Grandma through the same A.A.- and
12-step-based treatment program over
and over again... I'm still scoring
institutional A.A. with a zero here, but this situation bears
watching.

<p>
Please note that I have specifically restricted this item to
robbing members. Another list of cult
characteristics that I was looking at used a different criterion:
just &quot;economic exploitation.&quot; That
writer found institutional A.A. guilty of robbing the health
insurance industry on a massive scale. True,
but I'm going to let that one slide. Lots of other businesses,
even a few corrupt doctors and hospitals, do
their best to steal all of the money that
they can get their hands on, too &#8212; Medicare fraud is common &#8212;
but that doesn't make them evil religious cults. It just makes them some
more very ordinary, boringly common, greedy thieving people...

<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_work4free">98</a>.
<i>Making cult members work long hours for free.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 1.<br>
<p>
This one is tricky. At first glance, you might think that nobody
works at anything.
People may volunteer for some tasks at some centers, but
there is no great pressure to do so.
There are no cult-owned businesses where members do slave labor all day.
Nobody stands on the street corner, selling books or flowers.
Nobody goes door to door, soliciting donations and new members.
So you might think that nobody works for the organization for free.
<p>
But that isn't so. The first big requirement is that members have to
spend a lot of their spare time attending meetings. Nobody pays them for
all of those hours. Even if they don't feel like attending, or feel that it
is helping them, they are supposed to be there for somebody else,
to &quot;help others&quot; by making sure that the meeting is
well attended.

<p>
Then, good members have to do recruiting.
It's called &quot;Twelfth Step work&quot;, and nobody gets paid for it.
Members believe that they have to do Twelfth Step work if they
are to maintain
their own sobriety &#8212; that they can only stay sober by helping others to
get and stay sober.
<p>
Then the more senior members have to become sponsors, and indoctrinate and
supervise the newcomers. That can often be very time consuming, to the point
that some members spend <i>all</i> of their spare time on A.A.-related busy-work,
and nobody gets paid for any of it. The only people who make
money are the ones at the top of the pyramid,
the ones who print and sell the books, AAWS, and who run the GSO.
<p>
The slogans in A.A. are,<br>
<i>&quot;We can only keep that which we give away.&quot;<br>
&quot;We should freely give away that which we have been freely given.&quot;</i><br>
So eventually, most of the old-timers work for free, at least a little bit.

<i>Total immersion and total isolation.</i></b></font><br>

<p>
A.A. does not lock people away in communes, or prevent them from communicating
with non-A.A. people.
<ul>
<li>
They do, however, make a fair attempt at saturating beginners
with <i>90 Meetings In 90 Days</i>, and they strongly encourage beginners to
spend most of their spare time in the company of other A.A. members, or studying
A.A. literature like the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p><li>
They also encourage newcomers to get a sponsor who will keep them
busy with indoctrinating projects.
<p><li>
Also, new members are definitely encouraged to avoid socializing with
former drinking buddies, for obvious good reasons. Often, that rules
out almost every former friend, because some alcoholics just didn't
have any other friends than drinking buddies. So they end up just
socializing with other members.
<p><li>
There are also &quot;clean and sober recovery houses&quot; where new A.A. members
are encouraged to live, where they will be exposed to non-stop A.A. indoctrination,
and they will only associate with other A.A. members, and they will attend at least
one A.A. meeting per day, and they will be encouraged to read only A.A. council-approved
literature.
<p><li>
The harmful social isolation of AA is most obvious in the ban on
sexual or love relationships outside of the &quot;fellowship&quot;.
A giant red flag is the so-called &quot;recommendation&quot; that you not date
or start any new relationships for the first year of your eternal recovery,
and then, when you do have relationships, they should be with other A.A. members,
who &quot;understand what it is to be in recovery&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
But that still isn't total immersion, and it is not total isolation.

<p>
Institutional A.A. is quite a different story, however. There, they really do
lock people away in detox centers and rehab facilities, and limit or block their communication
with people outside of the center, and control their access to information.
It is very common for them to restrict reading materials to the Bible and A.A.
literature, and to occupy all of the
patients' time with A.A. meetings and &quot;group therapy&quot;
sessions that are really just another form of A.A. indoctrination.
And friends and relatives can only talk to the patients when the staff permit it.
And of course when people leave the rehab facility, they are strongly encouraged to
enter a &quot;half-way house&quot;, or &quot;recovery house&quot;, as described above.
Institutional A.A. scores a 10.

So what's a passing score? That's a good question. Considering just
how nasty all of the characteristics in that list are, I'd consider
any group that scored 50% or more as both obnoxious and dangerous.
<p>

And how does A.A. add up? Like this:
<ul>
<li> The first 93 items are applicable to just about any old
ordinary, average nasty cult. There, A.A. scores 855 out of a
possible 930. That's 91 percent. Most teachers will give you
a plain old, full-blown, unqualified, gold-star &quot;A&quot;
for a score of 91.

<p>
<li> The last seven items are applicable only to the really
crazy, nothing-but-enslaved-zombies type of cult. Nevertheless,
including those items, the street version of A.A. still scores 863
out of a possible 1000, yielding an 85 percent score. That's a
solid &quot;B&quot;.
<p>
<li> But <b><i>institutional</i> A.A.</b> scores 894 out of a possible 1000 there, yielding
an 89 percent score. Any teacher will give you a solid
&quot;B plus&quot;, or maybe even a forgiving &quot;A minus&quot;
for an 89.
</ul>

<p>
So, in my opinion, the street version of A.A. will easily pass
the test for being an ordinary, run-of-the-mill irrational cult,
and will even pass the test of being a hard-core cult. The
institutional version of A.A. easily passes the test of being a
very dangerous hard-core cult. Welcome to <i>One Flew Over the
Cuckoos Nest</i>.

<p>
If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like

<p>
If it looks like a cult, walks like a cult, talks like a
cult, recruits like a cult, brainwashes like
a cult, punishes like a cult, and like all cults, pretends it
isn't a cult, then there is a pretty good chance
that it's a cult.

Just one last parting comment: A cynic will ask,
&quot;What's the difference between a respectable
religion and a crazy religious cult?&quot; And the answer is,
&quot;About a million registered voters.&quot;

<p>
The biggest cults are called &quot;mainstream cults&quot;, and the
politicians don't call them cults at all. They don't have the guts.
You can
believe any crazy thing you want to if you have a big enough
voting block to back you up. The
Mormons are the premier example of that. The Seventh Day
Adventists and the Jehovah's Witnesses aren't doing badly, either,
and the Twelve-Step religion is okay, too. The Native American
peoples, or &quot;First Peoples&quot;, on the
other hand, have seen the Supreme Court rule their religious
Peyote Ceremonies illegal, because they
eat a cactus with a kick. The real reason is simply &quot;Not
enough voters.&quot; The Roman Catholic Church in the USA
never had a problem with the Priest having wine for Mass, all
through Prohibition.

<p>
One man's illegal drug is another man's holy sacrament, if you have
enough voters. And apparently, the same rule applies to alcoholism
and drug addiction treatment: one man's crazy whacked-out superstitious
faith-healing nonsense is another man's
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Ramstad">respectable medical treatment,
billable to your HMO</a>, if you have enough registered voters.
