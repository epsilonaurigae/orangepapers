Once America got into the war, after Pearl Harbor,
Frank Buchman and Moral Re-Armament were not opposed to the war.
Quite the contrary, they were
very &quot;patriotic&quot;, and all for it, just as long as
somebody else served in the military services.
Many of the Moral Re-Armament leaders, the inner circle of disciples
in both Great Britain and the USA, tried to dodge the draft, claiming
that they were &quot;lay evangelists&quot; who were essential on
the home
front for such patriotic tasks as managing Moral Re-Armament and
producing morality plays like &quot;You Can Defend America.&quot;<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
[I love that &#8212; not &quot;<i>We</i> Can Defend America&quot;, but
&quot;<i>You</i> Can Defend America.&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You do the
slogging through the mud, and the fighting and the bleeding and the dying, and we
will wave the flag and cheer you on. We are real patriots.&quot;</font>]
</font>

<p>
Frank Buchman quickly, opportunistically, switched from praising Heinrich Himmler
and Adolf Hitler to waving the American flag and declaring that Moral Re-Armament
was &quot;the highest patriotism&quot;:

Before the war, Frank Buchman declared that the answer for world peace was:
<ol>
<li> Everybody had to &quot;change&quot;, and
<li> Confess that they were wrong, and
<li> Make an honest apology, and
<li> Join Frank Buchman's cult.
</ol>
After that failed, and World War II started anyway, Frank Buchman's answer for
the defense of America was:
<ol>
<li> Everybody had to &quot;change&quot;, and
<li> Confess that they were wrong, and
<li> Make an honest apology, and
<li> &quot;Enlist&quot; in Frank Buchman's cult.
</ol>

<p>
Notice the myriad propaganda tricks in those two pages:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#non_sequitur">Broken logic, <i>non sequitur</i></a>:
Adolf Hitler started WW II by invading
Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and the Japanese started it in the Pacific by
invading China and Korea and bombing Pearl Harbor. Therefore, Frank Buchman said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;America needs a change of heart.&quot;<br>
</font>
Say what?<br>
Buchman didn't say anything about Adolf Hitler and the Nazis needing to get a change
of heart.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#non_sequitur">Bait and Switch</a>:
First, Buchman said that the American people were good &#8212;
&quot;honest, unselfish, neighborly, clean, and free&quot; &#8212;
just to get people to start agreeing with him,
and then Buchman suddenly switched sides and challenged that statement and implied
that Americans were not so good after all.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii">False assumptions,
unsupported allegations, and assuming facts not in evidence</a>:
<ul>
<li> God will guide your thoughts during your morning &quot;Quiet Time&quot;,
and give you work orders.
<li> You must be governed by somebody else.
<li> Human nature is bad and must be changed.
<li> Only God can change human nature.
<li> You will change for the better if you practice Buchmanism.
<li> George Washington and Abraham Lincoln &quot;listened to God&quot;
in Frank Buchman's occult manner.
<li> &quot;Our fathers looked to God for their direction. We've looked
about everyplace else.&quot;
<li> William Penn said, &quot;Men must be governed by God, or they will
be ruled by tyrants.&quot;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#af0000">
William Penn may have said it, and it was one of Frank Buchman's favorite
quotes, but was it true?
William Penn was not quoting scripture. That was something that he
made up, using the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or"><i>Either/Or Propaganda Technique</i></a>.
<p>
And wasn't William Penn actually such an obnoxious religious
extremist and heretic that the English kicked him out?
Remember
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#Henson_re_Quakers">
the comments of the Bishop of Durham, Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson</a>, while
criticizing Buchman's Groups:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The early Quakers were carried to strange excesses by their persuasion that
they were divinely inspired. They also faced their fellow Christians in the
tone of men who had a unique and infallible assurance of truth, whose witness
could only be rejected by those who were blinded by prejudice or enslaved by
sin.&quot;</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That was just like Frank Buchman and his followers,
who declared that people who dared to criticize them were
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot120.html#Campbell_Howard_01">morally defeated</a>&quot;.
</font>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#wrap">Wrapping himself in the flag</a>.
Frank was very &quot;patriotic&quot;.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#association">Association</a>
&#8212; Frank Buchman cited George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and tried
to imply that he had some kind of kinship with them.

<p>
<li> Citing Washington and Lincoln was also an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#authorities">Appeal to Authorities</a> &#8212; trying to claim that
honored gentlemen, like the nation's Founding Fathers, agreed with
Frank Buchman's occult practices.
And prominently displaying the endorsement by General Pershing was
another appeal to authorities.

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#equality">False Equality</a>.
Abraham Lincoln said that God would communicate His desires in some
manner or other &#8212;
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;He finds a way of letting me know it&quot;</a>.
</font>
Frank Buchman then implied that Lincoln's words supported Buchman's practice
of &quot;receiving Guidance&quot; during morning &quot;Quiet Times&quot;.
But that was a false equality &#8212; Abraham Lincoln most assuredly did not
say that God gave him marching orders during daily s&eacute;ances or spook sessions.

<p>
<li> Another False Equality: Joining Frank Buchman's cult was not the same
as enlisting in the U.S. Army and fighting against the fascists.

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">Either/Or Technique</a>
&#8212; EITHER you must be governed by something petty, like your
wife, or greed, OR ELSE you must practice Buchmanism and be &quot;governed by God&quot;.

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#guilt">Guilt Induction</a>
&#8212; you aren't really very &quot;honest, unselfish,
neighborly, clean, and free&quot;, after all, are you?...

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#loaded">Deceptive Language</a>, and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#bait_switch">Bait And Switch</a>:
&quot;Listening to God&quot; really meant that after you had joined Frank Buchman's cult,
you would be ordered around by Frank's lieutenants who would tell you what God really said.

False Assumptions and Unsupported Allegations:

<li> Since when is there a &quot;secret of change&quot;?
Likewise, a &quot;secret&quot; of &quot;getting direction from God&quot;?
Frank Buchman had been broadcasting his doctrines on the radio for years, so they couldn't
have been very secret.

&#8212; So that is also the trick of using
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#slanted">Slanted Language</a>.
&quot;Secret&quot; sounds so much more exciting than &quot;doctrine&quot;
or &quot;technique&quot;&quot;, like
<font color="#4f007f">

defense&quot;</i> if you don't join Frank Buchman's group?
<li> Do you really have to confess all of your petty sins and moral shortcomings to other people,
like your boss, in &quot;a spirit of honest apology&quot;?

<li> Will practicing Buchmanism really give you all kinds of abilities and powers, like
overcoming disunity, being a rallying point, and becoming a recruiting center for Frank's
religion?
<li> Who says that everybody needs to make an &quot;honest apology&quot;?<br>
Did Frank Buchman make an honest apology for his Nazi sympathizing and Hitler-praising
ways?
<font color="#9F0000">[No.]</font>

<li> Who says that the children will say that &quot;Gee, it's fun to be
home now&quot; if Mommy and Daddy join Frank Buchman's church?
Where is the evidence for that?

<li> Who says that practicing Buchmanism will transform neighborhoods?
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Backyard gossip changes to planning for the community.&quot;</i></font>
Where is the evidence for that?<br>
Frank Buchman declared that,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Thousands of families are making the experiment&quot;</font>
(<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2numbers"><i>Appeal To Numbers</i></a>),
and then he made some sweeping generalizations about nice things happening,
but he didn't actually supply any real evidence that the experiment had
produced good results.

</ol>
<p>
...And on and on. Most of the sentences on those two pages are deceptive and dishonest,
half-truths at best, or childishly simple-minded thinking.

&quot;our softness, graft, laziness, extravagance, buckpassing, materialism&quot;.

Frank Buchman's gang even managed to get their cult-religion propaganda
printed up as Civil Defense posters:

<i>&quot;Be directed by God&quot; through spiritual wires that can't be cut...
&quot;Listen to God and obey....&quot;</i>
Yes, that's Buchmanism, all right.
<p>
And as usual, there wasn't a word of criticism of the Nazis or
Adolf Hitler in any of that.
<p>
Also, the lines,<br>
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;KEEP THE MORAL STANDARDS OF THE NATION HIGH.<br>
Don't weaken the home front by wangling something for yourself.&quot;
</font>
</center>
actually mean that unions should not demand higher wages for the workers.  Frank Buchman was always a 
<a href="orange-rroot600.html" target="_blank">&quot;spiritual strike-breaker&quot;</a>,
who used religious arguments to declare that the workers demanding good wages was &quot;selfishness&quot;.
Oddly, Frank Buchman never denounced the ultra-rich industrialists for raking in millions of
dollars and living first-class lifestyles in glittering palaces.

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="ftnt038_ret"> </a>
During the war, troupes of Buchman's followers toured the country,
performing melodramatic morality plays like <i>You Can Defend America</i>,
<i>The Good Road</i>, and <i>The Forgotten Factor</i>.
They encouraged workers not to strike, claiming
that it would be &quot;unpatriotic&quot;. The Buchmanites denounced
&quot;Divisive Materialism, Our Unseen Enemy&quot;, and equated demanding
fair wages with giving aid to the
enemy.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt038">38</a></sup></font>

A few years after the war,
Geoffrey Williamson visited the MRA center in Caux, Switzerland, and
saw <i>The Good Road</i> being made into a film:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A western farmyard setting, reminiscent in style of <i>Oklahoma</i>,
served to introduce an incredible story of a feud between a farmer, Zeke,
a crusty old bachelor, and his young neighbour, Rufe.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Rufe's cattle have broken Zeke's fences, so Zeke gets his gun and announces
his determination to shoot Rufe immediately he shows up. But Rufe appears
with his young wife hanging on his arm and bearing a spice cake she has baked
specially to placate their rough neighbor! When Rufe says, &quot;Sorry,&quot;
and his wife holds out the spice cake, Zeke lays aside his gun, which is the
cue for everyone to start singing:
<blockquote>
<font face="Courier,Sanserif,Swiss">
The whole world is my neighbor<br>
When you and I get together...
</font>
</blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If this is a sample of the film that is going to change the world, I thought,
the Buchmanites <i>must</i> be crazy. I couldn't believe that anyone could
seriously advance such a preposterous story as offering a solution to world
problems. By the same token the second world war could have been avoided
if Chamberlain had taken a spice cake in his luggage when he went to meet
Hitler.<br>

Frank Buchman with the cast of <i>The Good Road</i>
</center>

<p>
Geoffrey Williamson also saw the show live:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In strict fairness I must set down the fact that the live show made a
more favourable impression than the film &quot;rushes&quot; had done.
It was brightly dressed, well staged, and played with such tremendous zest
by a youthful cast, that it would have been churlish not to have shown
appreciation. It certainly &quot;got across&quot; with the audience,
whose applause for every item was almost prodigal.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But many of the songs, though tuneful enough, were na&iuml;ve attempts to
put over uplift in the vein of Ella Wheeler Wilcox. I don't know what visiting
statesmen and politicians made of them all, but the Buchmanites, at any rate,
seemed to be whipped into ecstasy by such items as <i>Sorry is a Magic Little Word</i>
or <i>If You Harnessed All the Heart-power in the World</i>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I found it impossible to revise my estimate of the film. Much of it was sorry
stuff, strung together in a haphazard sort of way, with the MRA propaganda
laid on crudely. This puzzled me considerably, for I had studied enough examples
of Buchmanite propaganda to know that they can be subtle enough when they choose.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once more I yawned over the incredible sob-story of the tough feudist whose
thoughts were diverted from neighborcide by the gift of a spice cake; but there
were other sketches just as callow. There was an American family scene, for
instance, which opened with glimpses of father, mother, sister, brother, and
grandma all preoccupied with their own selfish pursuits, constantly bickering.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The curtain fell, to rise again on a &quot;changed&quot; family, though
how they had all become transformed we were not told. Now, of course,
everyone was polite and kindly and the family was united.
So united that they insisted on singing two songs together &#8212; <i>Families
Can Be Fun</i> and <i>Sorry is a Magic Little Word</i>.
The last song was supposed, apparently, to provide a key to the whole
sketch and a message of world importance. Learn to say &quot;sorry,&quot;
and harmony flies into the home! And if that works in families, why not
in the great family of nations?<br>

Then came an industrial scene devised to show Moral Re-Armament as a bridge
between Management and Labour. A stylized setting of giant cog-wheels,
reminiscent of Chaplin's <i>Modern Times</i>, formed the background
against which Management and Labour faced each other from opposite
sides of the stage.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As the curtains rose on this scene the wheels of industry were turning
smoothly, with groups of workers in American style overalls swaying in
the background to simulate the rhythmic beat of pistons. Production
was booming and both Management and Labour announced to the press their
intention of playing their full part in saving Democracy.<br>

<a name="ftnt140_ret"> </a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then, for no apparent reason, a young minx named &quot;Miss Trust&quot;
tripped in and gaily distributed little packets all around. She was
sowing seeds of dissension between Management and Labour! At this point
my erstwhile strike-leader friend nudged me in the ribs and whispered:
&quot;Do you suppose it's a coincidence that she's dressed like that?&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For Miss Trust, &quot;essense of subversion,&quot; was dressed wholly in red &#8212;
a red hat, a red costume, and she carried a red handbag and a red umbrella.

Vic Kitchen was another long-time Oxford Group member, and author of the
O.G. testimonial <i>&quot;I Was A Pagan&quot;</i> (1934), where he declared that
he was an ex-drunkard who was now &quot;receiving supernatural aid ...
through God-consciousness &#8212; through direct personal contact with the third environment &#8212;
the spiritual environment I had so long been
seeking.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt140">140</a></sup></font>

Slowly the wheels of industry came to a stop, but just as Miss Trust began
to wave her umbrella aloft and to laugh in triumph, a stranger strode onto
the stage. A fine, upright fellow known, apparently as &quot;Change.&quot;
Holding the centre of the stage, he proceeded to give both Management and
Labour a verbal injection of Moral Re-Armament ideology. So they united to
throw &quot;Miss Trust&quot; out (having found her seed packets to be empty!),
and the curtain fell on the wheels of industry turning once more. Oh! I
had almost forgotten it! Everybody singing: &quot;There's enough in the world
for everybody's need; but not for everyone's greed.&quot;<br>

Finally, Garth Lean gave us this very revealing description of Frank Buchman's
treatment of his acting ensemble:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
[Frank Buchman] ended [the day] with a scolding to his team, busy
performing <i>You Can Defend America</i>, for 'selling a show instead
of the philosophy' and consequently not speaking convincingly
from the platform or selling books to the audience afterwards.<br>

<i>The actors didn't sell enough books to the audience after the show?<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
This is sounding just like the cults that nag you in the airports,
always trying to sell you a book. They all have to make their quotas or
else the cult leader really comes down on them.</i>
