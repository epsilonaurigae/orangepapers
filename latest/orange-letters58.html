From: 	&quot;H.&quot;<br>
Subject: 	AA as a sub culture<br>

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
I think that AA may be considered a sub culture.  More exclusive than a
private club.  Perhaps, it may be called a &quot;secret society&quot;.  It is,
ostensibly, anonymous.  It may not be, at all times and places.

<p>
Why?
<ul>
<li>
1. 
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_new_identity">A member calls him/herself
an &quot;alcoholic&quot;</a>.  A drunkard is not, by definition, an alcoholic.

<p>
<li>
2.  It has a &quot;big book&quot; &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma">a text which is all inclusive</a>.

<p>
<li>
3.  It has an argot,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak">a long set of coded words and
phrases</a>, each of which
has a meaning exclusive to AA.  These meanings appear to be congruent with
commonly accapted meanings.  But, they are not.  The AA meaning of the
words and phrases are, for the most part, not what they seem to &quot;normies&quot;.

<p>
<li>
4.  It takes an &quot;alcoholic&quot; to understand an &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_enemy">A &quot;normie&quot;, by definition,
cannot &quot;understand&quot;</a>.
This rules out, perforce, meaningful interaction.

<p>
It implies that &quot;normies&quot; must always consider the &quot;recovering
alcoholic&quot; as tantamount to an invalid.

<p>
This allows the game to carry on.

<p>
<li>
5.   AA is a third degree game.  AA requires 3 roles: victim, perpetrator,
rescuer.  Without those 3 players, AA cannot exist.
</ul>

<p>
Regards

<p>

From: Janet C.<br>
Subject: Thank you &#8212; Divine Intervention via Google<br>

<p>
I don't know how in a google.com search I came across your
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html">Bait and Switch</a>&quot; but it was so timely.

<p>

After two years going to daily meetings,  (deeply involved with service
work, chairperson of my group, baking Banana bread weekly, and even
scrubbing the toilets of our meeting room for god sakes) I was sitting
in a meeting 2 months ago and had a <i>real</i> &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; That
I was done. That it was all a total crock. That I had to get out of
there <i>now</i>. That I had not moved forward in two years and that the
time invested was a waste.

<p>

So, I decided I'd spend that hour working out at the YMCA everyday
instead. I also sought an acupuncturist for treatment of depression and
headaches (chronic pain due to an inoperable brain tumor &#8212; of which, of
course I could not so much as mention in a meeting... Singleness of
purpose, you know. Heaven forbid you have a <i>real</i> disease.)

<p>

Today, two months later, my pain is manageable, my vitality vastly
improved, my freelance writing assignment have tripled. (I kept waiting
for the fear of financial insecurity to be lifted, instead of getting
off my duff and taking action myself.)

<p>

Yesterday, being July 4th, I thought I'd check in with the old group, so
I went to a meeting (banana bread in hand).  All the old windbags were
there. I thought they'd be happy to see me, instead it was as if I were
invisible. The only attention I received was when the chairperson made
eye contact with me while saying anyone who stops going to meetings is
doomed to a fate worse than death. It was all I could do not to say
<i>&quot;The only fate worse than death I could think of was an eternal
purgatory of endless AA meetings.&quot;</i>

<p>

Thank you for your writings. Is there a hard copy I can purchase. I
would like to snail mail it to someone who managed to extricate himself
much earlier than I did from the program.

<p>

Regards,<br> 
Janet C.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Janet,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story, and congratulations on your new freedom.

<p>
And the story that you were using alcohol as a pain-killer because of another
medical condition is such a common tale.
A.A. just disregards the fact that a whole lot of people are not really &quot;alcoholics&quot;
<i>per se</i>, they are sick and in pain and need medical help and are
just trying to kill their pain.
When the medical problem is cured, the alcohol problem disappears.
<p>
In fact, that story is so common that many doctors now consider <i>all</i> cases of
&quot;alcoholism&quot; to be dual-diagnosis cases &#8212; that the patient always has some underlying
medical or psychiatric condition that causes the excessive alcohol consumption.
<a href="orange-letters8.html#need_medications">More on that here</a>.

<p>
There isn't any hard copy of the Orange Papers to buy.
It's all for free, and there isn't any &quot;dead-tree&quot; issue.
What I recommend is that people download the
archive files and burn a CD so that they have their own copy of the whole
web site.
The archive files are listed
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://www.orange-papers.org/menu1.html#archives">here</a>, and instuctions
on how to burn the CD are

then have a friend who does have one make a CD (or several copies) for you.

Hi there, could you please suggest an alternative to A.A that works,  because
I see I only have 2 choices to die of liver failure or to become an A.A.
<p>
Please advise

Rob

Hello Rob,
<p>
It is Alcoholics Anonymous that tries to make you believe that you only have a
very limited choice &#8212; that your only choices are A.A. or death.
(That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">the Either/Or propaganda trick</a>.)

<p>
Actually, there are many choices. A.A. is actually so bad that no treatment or help or
support groups is still better than going to A.A., because A.A. has a lot of nasty
side effects like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">raising the rate of binge drinking
in alcoholics</a>, and

From: 	John McC <br>
Subject: RE: Court Cards<br>
<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>

   Forgot to mention this in the last e-mail. I recently sent an e-mail
 to the &quot;GSO&quot; of AA inquiring as to what AA's &quot;position&quot; was with
regards to &quot;court cards&quot;, and the hostility that people who go to AA
meetings on them experience from &quot;voluntary&quot; AA members. The response
from the AA GSO first wanted to know if I asked the question as a
&quot;professional&quot; (which I am-a certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor),
or as a &quot;member&quot; of AA. My response to that was that that I was a
professional that did NOT engage in the unethical standard of
referring clients to an organization that I also was a &quot;member&quot; of.
<p>

      I am wondering if the GSO responders had two sets of responses
to my inquiry, and now, if I am even going to get one, given my
honesty in my response to their inquiry about me.
<p>

    Have you had any e-mail exchanges from the AA GSO, and if so,
what have they been like?
<p>

John McC.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again,
<p>
No, I have never written to them.<br>
I guess I always figured that they would quickly guess
just from the tone of the questions where I was coming
from, and that I'd then just get a canned answer.

<p>
But then again, even that might be informative.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

<p>
As a counslor in a So. CA DUI Program, I am
genuinely

concerned at the  outright HOSTILITY many of my

clients have faced attending AA meetings while
having

to (due to a COUNTY requirement) with a &quot;court
card.&quot;
<p>
I personally do NOT believe in ANY &quot;mandatory&quot;
forced

attendance at ANY AA meeting, and wonder how AA

reconciles many members hostile attitutdes towards

&quot;court card attendees&quot; vs. its stated tradition of

&quot;attraction over promotion&quot; (since any source

mandating attendance to AA clearly VIOLATES THAT!).
<p>

Does AA have any plan to perhaps &quot;segregate&quot;
mandated

court card attendees to their own meetings (as it
does

with gender specific meetings, closed meetings,
etc.),

or perhaps just stop signing court cards all
togther

given the violation of one of AA's principles?

<p>

Thanks, John.
<p>



John, we often ask whether a person is an A.A.
member or not to help us
determine how much background about A.A. itself we
need to give.  We try
to be as complete as possible in our responses,
without repeating what a
member may already know.


<p>

I hope you won't mind if I start out with some
general information on
the General Service Office.  G.S.O. is a repository
of shared group
experience and functions as a resource center for
A.A. members and
groups who are looking for the shared experience of
the Fellowship.
G.S.O. does not give opinions on local matters, nor
do we give
directives to members or groups.  The role of G.S.O.
is to research A.A.
literature, correspondence files, and, at times, the
Archives, in order
to share the collected experience of groups in the
U.S. and Canada.  The
General Service Conference is the closest thing we
have to a group
conscience of A.A. in the U.S. and Canada.

<p>


As you may know, A.A. itself does not mandate that
anyone attend A.A.
meetings.  These decisions and policies are
sometimes made by courts and
treatment centers; these are outside organizations.
I hope that you
have brought your concerns to the organizations in
your community that
are mandating individuals to A.A. meetings.

<p>


A.A.'s service piece, &quot;Information on Alcoholics
Anonymous,&quot; states:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

The proof of attendance at meetings is not part of
A.A.'s procedure.
Each group is autonomous and has the right to choose
whether or not to
sign court slips.  In some areas the attendees
report on themselves, at
the request of the referring agency, and thus
alleviate breaking A.A.
members' anonymity.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>


This service pieces also states:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

We cannot discriminate against any prospective A.A.
member, even if he
or she comes to us under pressure from a court, an
employer, or any
other agency.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>


Although the strength of our program lies in the
voluntary nature of
membership in A.A., many of us first attended
meetings because we were
forced to, either by someone else or by inner
discomfort.  But continual
exposure to A.A. educated us to the true nature of
our illness... Who
made the referral to A.A. is not what A.A. is
interested in.  It is the
problem drinker who is our concern... We cannot
predict who will
recover, nor have we the authority to decide how
recovery should be
sought by any other alcoholic.

<p>


You can find this piece in its entirety on G.S.O.'s
A.A. Web site at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://www.aa.org/en_information_aa.cfm?PageID=11.">
http://www.aa.org/en_information_aa.cfm?PageID=11.</a>

<p>


A.A. has a history of cooperating with, but not
affiliating or
endorsing, outside organizations.  The general
philosophy to date has
been one of welcoming newcomers to A.A. no matter
how they have been
referred.  There will be some A.A. members who have
strong, personal
feelings about court mandated A.A. meetings, but
A.A. as a whole does
not have an opinion on this practice.  We can note,
however, that this
topic can be challenging for some A.A. groups and
often serve as great
opportunities for C.P.C. service (Cooperation With
the Professional
Community).

<p>


In our experience, a majority of A.A. groups do sign
court cards and
feel that it is in the spirit of cooperation with
the professionals and
institutions that are trying to help the suffering
alcoholic.  We do,
however, also know of some groups who do not sign
court cards.

<p>


In addition, you may be interested to read A.A.'s
Guidelines for A.A.
Members Employed in the Alcoholism Field, which can
be found on our Web
site at

From:  	&quot;Robert&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Supplements for Alcoholics<br>

<p>
Hello, Orange

<p>
I enjoy your website, and it reminds me somewhat of the Quackwatch
website &#8212; you both are concerned with unmasking falsehoods of varying
types. I appreciate your efforts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Robert,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>

Have you seen the books published in recent years that promote
mega-vitamin/mineral/amino acid supplements for curing alcoholism? I
believed the ideas promoted in SEVEN WEEKS TO SOBRIETY, and bought all
the supplements. Guess what? I still drank &#8212; every day. The author, Dr.
Mathes-Larson,  claimed that the success rate at her Bio-Recovery
Centre was 76%. I doubt the validity of that statement.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I haven't seen that. I also doubt that it will work.
<p>
That &quot;success rate&quot; sounds like another numbers game.
Anybody who really gets a success rate like that will become a millionaire overnight.
I mean really. The recovery industry is a $6.2 billion per year business, just in the
USA alone, and the recovery racket doesn't work. Anybody who comes up with something
that actually delivers a 76% success rate can take a giant slice of that pie for himself.

<p>
People do not usually drink because they need vitamins.
Vitamin deficiency can make you feel really bad, but the cause of alcoholism
is usually something other than vitamin deficiency.
<p>
And the cure is to get your mind made up about really quitting and staying quit.

<p>
<a name="damage"> </a>

I strongly recommend
vitamin supplements both for drinkers and newly sober people, but for a different
reason: one of the worst things that can happen to alcoholics
(besides cirrhosis of the liver and death)
is <i>Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</i> &#8212;
the total destruction of the short-term memory.
It is caused by hundreds of millions of
brain cells dying from extreme thiamine deficiency.
Even just one vitamin pill a day can prevent it.
<p>
I recommend that alcoholics, both drinking and recovering, take lots of B-complex with C
vitamins, in addition to a good general-purpose one-a-day everything pill.
Those who are still drinking desperately need the vitamins, because alcohol is really
good for leeching out the vitamins from your body.
And recovering alcoholics need to grow some new brain cells, and the B vitamins help
a lot.
<p>
Very recent research has shown that we do grow new brain cells. That is a revolutionary
finding that completely upsets the old belief that you never grow new brain cells after
you are born. So part of recovery from alcoholism is both growing new connections between
the surviving brain cells, and making some new brain cells to fill in the empty holes
in the brain. It takes years, but it happens.
<p>
(I am living proof of that. My short-term memory has improved a lot
during the last 5 years. It was really, really bad when I stopped drinking.)

</font>
<p>

Speaking of recovery, how long did it take  for your brain to recover,
i.e., clarity of thought, mental concentration, etc.?  I have never been
sober for more than 28 days (two months ago), so I can't speak from
personal experience.

<p>

keep up the good work,

<p>

Robert (an alcoholic for 11 years)

<p>
<font color="blue">
I experienced two distinct break-throughs in recovery:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The first was at about 9 months of recovery.
I had had delightful little awakenings from about 3 months on, rarely, just now and then,
sudden moments of clarity and elevated awareness,
but the first real big one happened at 9 months:
Suddenly the fog lifted and I was able to visualize and remember
faces again &#8212; as well as remember other things.
<p>
The brain damage was so bad that when I quit drinking,
I could not even close my eyes
and picture the faces of the evening newscasters whom I had been seeing for
20 years: Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, and Peter Jennings.
I would close my eyes and there would be nothing there.
Even while watching the evening news, I couldn't visualize their faces during the commercials.
I made a mental exercise of it &#8212; each evening, while watching the news,
during the commercials, I would close my eyes and try to visualize their faces.
No luck. Nothing. I saw nothing but black.

<p>
I also couldn't remember the faces of people whom I had just seen an hour earlier.<br>
I also couldn't remember people with whom I had talked for half an hour or more
earlier in the day.
<p>
That condition is called &quot;prosopagnosia&quot;, and it is often
caused by damage to the brain from toxic chemicals.
Both alcohol and industrial waste will do the job nicely.
<p>
Now on the bright side, I could watch all of the reruns on TV, and they would be
very interesting because I couldn't remember how they ended.
Sometimes I would have to watch the whole show before I could remember that I had
seen it before.

<p>
But at the 9-month point, suddenly I could do it &#8212; I could see them:
Brokaw, Kansas farm boy with a youthful
boyish face; Rather, jowls and tired lines in his face;
Jennings, eternally youthful and elegant.
I clearly remember that evening when, while watching the evening news, suddenly
I could picture their faces during the commercials. The brain was working again.

<p>
Along with the ability to remember faces came a general clarity. The fog lifted and I was
simply able to think more clearly, and see more clearly, and remember more things.

<p>
I described that stuff in a little more detail
<a href="orange-letters31.html#memory">here</a>.

<p>
<li> The second breakthrough was at the five-year point, when I started remembering details.
Suddenly I could actually make mental notes to myself and remember them the next day &#8212; things
like what page number I was on in a book, or what the room number of a friend was.
What a shock.
<p>
And again, I got just a little more mental clarity.

<p>
Now I still have to write down a lot of stuff. I still carry a little notepad with me
all of the time, and write down whatever I really want to remember. But the situation is
so much better than it used to be.

</ol>

<p>
I'd like to advise you to not let that stuff happen to you. At least take vitamins;
it really can save you from some damage. But of course quitting drinking entirely,
and quitting smoking too, if you smoke, will really improve your health.
Quitting smoking helps the brain to recover faster, too, because you aren't
polluting your body with all of the toxic chemicals and poisons that are in cigarette smoke.
Your brain can concentrate on repairing the damage from alcohol, rather than fighting
the damage from tobacco.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

From:  	&quot;John L M.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Going back to therapy<br>
Date:  	Fri, July 7, 2006 9:13 am<br>

<p>

Hey Orange:
<p>
Well, I'm getting back into the therapy, in part to deal with the
depression with dealing with CSE (child support enforcement, and let me
tell you if there isn't a bigger group of legalized nazi's out there),
and my addiction, and I keep running into the AA chatter.  Let me drop
two terms on you.
<p>
First off, this guy runs out the old canard &quot;it's spiritual, not
religious&quot;, when I tell him I don't believe in God.  He then runs out
the question &quot;so you think you're in charge of everything&quot;?  What?  So
now every atheist in the world has a narcassistic complex?  He then
redefines &quot;spiritual&quot; as &quot;seeking help outside of yourself&quot;.  At this
point, I'm wondering if I'm the one who should be on the couch.  Yes you
seek help outside of yourself, but you don't worship it?
<p>
Then when I tell him that I'm looking more into AVRT and RR, he says
that might help, but to go to AA and &quot;take what you can from it, and
leave the rest&quot;.  Applying that logic, you could visit a KKK meeting and
say, &quot;well, at least you can take the patriotism and leave the rest&quot;.
<p>
Unbelievable.  Well, I'm working on my own NCP web site, so when I get
it up with some facts and figures, I'll send you the link.

<p>

Talk to you later.<br>
John M

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Don't you just love how they
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak">redefine the language</a>?
If spirituality is
&quot;seeking help outside of yourself&quot;, then taking your car to a
mechanic must be a very holy act. And taking your TV to the repairman is heavenly.
(Hey, come to think of it, I already wrote a joke about that,
<a href="orange-jokes.html#TV_repair">here</a>.
I didn't realize how prescient I was being.)
<p>
And the line about &quot;take what you want and leave the rest&quot; is
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2">a bait-and-switch trick</a>.
Next they will tell you that you must <i>thoroughly</i> follow their path,
or else the magic won't work. So you can't take what you want and leave the rest,
or you are guilty of not working the entire program properly.

<p>
You know the line that is recited at the start of every meeting,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY have we
seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;
</font>
If the program doesn't work, it's your fault because you didn't <i>thoroughly</i>
follow the program &#8212; part of which is to totally abstain from alcohol.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Take what you want and leave the rest&quot;
</font>
is just an advertising slogan to get the suckers in the door.
Then the message is gradually switched to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You must do all of Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps all of the time,
<font color="#9F0000"><b>or else</b></font> you are
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_warrant">signing your own death warrant</a>&quot;.

From:  	&quot;John L M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	MRA and union busting<br>

<p>

Hey Orange:
<p>
I was reading the section where you talk about the MRA's union busting.
Two things:

<p>

1.  Have you ever read that book &quot;Confessions of a union buster&quot; (I
think that's the title of it).  It's about a guy who was a union buster,
and ironically, also an alcoholic.
<p>
2.  I don't know whether it's design or not, but I see a lot of what you
could see as conservative politics in AA, both in person and online.
For instance, one list I was a part of for a little while frequently
talked and griped about the ACLU &quot;taking God out of public life&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">

I think that the politics are inherent in the design of authoritarian cult religions.
The book that really opened my eyes to that was
<a href="orange-top10.html#Guru_Papers"><i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian
Power</i> by Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad</a>, which is on my top 10 list.
<p>
Kramer and Alstad pointed out that cults are very authoritarian.
They almost always demand that you obey the guru.
The cult may wrap that demand in the Bible or some other scriptures, and they
may rationalize it by declaring that the guru is so much wiser than you are, so you
should follow his guidance, but it still means that the guru is the dictator and
you are the slave.
<p>
Well that is also the system in fascism and neo-Conservatism.
The F&uuml;hrer, President, &quot;Decider&quot;, or Corporate President is your
master, and you must obey. The reason why you must obey varies &#8212; it might be that he
knows more than you (insider information, &quot;actionable intelligence&quot;), or because he
is supposedly more competent than you, or because somebody elected him,
or whatever, but it still means that he is the boss and you are the slave.

<p>
Frank Buchman constantly declared that he was the wise man who could hear the voice of
God better than you could, so you should obey a spiritual dictator like him.
Frank pulled another bait-and-switch trick there: He demanded that people obey the voice
of God, but that ended up meaning that people should obey Frank because he heard the Voice of God
better than anybody else.
<p>
Frank Buchman openly advocated having fascist theocracies running all of the countries of
the world &#8212; &quot;the true dictatorship of the living God&quot;
&#8212; &quot;true democracy&quot; where nobody voted, and everybody just obeyed Frank.
<p>
It was downright inevitable that Buchman would like the Nazis. They were birds of a feather.

<p>
It is only a hop, skip, and a jump down that path to Alcoholics Anonymous declaring that
you should obey your sponsor because he is so much wiser and more experienced than you.
And he is allegedly more spiritual, too, because he has more years of sobriety than you
(or so they say).
<p>
And they too like to yammer about how you should obey God and do the will of God, which
again means obey the old-timers in the cult
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#absurd_ideas">who are more experienced in hearing the
voice of God</a> than you are.

<p>
And then, somehow, once you buy into the authoritarian model,
all of the rest of the garbage creeps in like a bunch of cockroaches at night.
The leader gets glorified, so any challenges to him are inherently wrong and immoral, so
things like labor unions, the ACLU, and even democracy are automatically bad
just because they challenge the authorities.
If you were really moral you would know your place and quit making trouble.
God wants you to be humble and obedient.

<p>
I never read the book &quot;Confessions of a Union Buster&quot;. I'll check it out.
<p>
Have a good day.

Date:   Thu, June 15, 2006 12:04 &nbsp; (Answered July 8.)<br>
From:   &quot;David W.&quot;<br>
Subject:        Mayflower Hotel<br>

<p>

In searching some of my favorite architecture I came across an article
on one of your pages that interested me. It would appear that your facts
however are a little off about the Mayflower Hotel (now a seniors
facility) on Main St. in Akron, OH. You've stated that:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot; The public telephone was on the ground floor of the hotel, but the
hotel bar was upstairs, on a raised level. They were not at opposite
ends of the lobby, so it was impossible for Bill to have stood in the
middle of the lobby and looked back and forth between one and the other,&quot;...
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

This is incorrect, having been a long time fan if it's 1920s Deco style
and having reviewed the floor plans of the structure as it's been
changed over the years, during the period in which you refer (1931-1946)
the Lounge was located on the bottom floor to the left, in the rear of
the secondary common area, directly across from the two public phones,
separated by the registration and bellhop window. The entire secondary
common area is raised in relationship to the main common area than the
main stair case arises from. During this period of time it would have
been entirely possible to view both the Lounge and public phones while
standing in front of the registration area. I apologize if I come off as
critical by correcting you, it's certainly not my intention. Otherwise,
I enjoyed the read. Thanks.



<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi. Sorry to take so long to get back to you on this.
It's actually because I consider it important.
I've been double-checking my facts.

<p>
The author of the biography of Bill Wilson that was written
by &quot;Matthew J. Raphael&quot; (a pseudonym), &quot;Bill W. and Mr. Wilson&quot;,
says that he has photographic proof that Bill Wilson's story
is physically impossible. I went to the library and got the book
back out, and have been re-reading his statements.

<p>
The pages from 7 to 13 explain the story. If need be, I can
scan them into my computer and email them to you.

<p>
The most relevant lines are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;None of the several narratives of Bill W.'s moment of truth
conforms to the actual configuration of the lobby in 1935.
They all misleadingly depict Bill crossing between the
elevator bank and the bar at opposite ends. Given the deployment
of furniture in 1935 (according to an old photograph), so
as to leave an aisle to the desk from the Main Street stairs,
the only possible path for Bill to have paced ran north and
south across the width of the lobby, with the elevators at one
end. But what stood at the other end, past the desk in the
middle, was the State Street entrance. There was no bar on
the same lobby level as the elevators. It lay neither &quot;down
the lobby&quot; (AA) nor &quot;at one end of my beat&quot; (AACA) nor
&quot;at one end of the lobby&quot; (PIO) nor &quot;directly across from
his path of march&quot; (BW). To enter the Merryman Tavern,
Bill would have had to climb seven steps to the mezzanine
level, and he could not have seen inside without such an ascent.
(This may account for the otherwise inexplicable emphasis in
the accounts on bar sounds rather than alluring smells or

would have blocked his view of the mezzanine. The phone bank,
tucked around the corner of the lobby extention, would have
provided him sanctuary from ocular temptation.&quot;<br>

You mentioned having blueprints or some evidence of the layout
of the hotel at that time. If you have better evidence than
Matthew J. Raphael, and can prove that it is really
physically possible for Bill Wilson's story to be true,
and that Matthew J. Raphael is in error, then the A.A.
true believers will love you forever.

<p>
My attitude is simply, &quot;Let's get to the truth, whatever it
is. Let's put all of the evidence on the table and see what
the facts are.&quot;

<p>
Have a good day, and a pleasant weekend.

<p>

not to blow smoke up your 'you-know-what' but I think that you are one truly evolved
thinker.  Recently I have been reading your writings nightly after work.  You have
so eloquently put into words many of my deepest thoughts and beliefs.  Stumbling
across your work was like finding the only life jacket on a sinking ship in the
middle of the Atlantic.

Thanks again for your honesty and efforts.

From:  	&quot;Mark S.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Unconditional love?<br>

<p>
Hi again Orange,

<p>
Thanks for publishing my email a few weeks back; it was good to let off
steam. I used to hear a lot in meetings about unconditional love, but during
a recent period of (godless) quiet reflection I came to realize that I have
felt a little hurt lately. Since my departure from AA doctrine and my
obvious discomfort in meetings at various times while I attempted to
reconcile the irreconcilable(!), nobody &#8212; not a soul &#8212; has picked up the
phone to see how I'm doing.
<p>
Seemingly, despite having done more service than most in the Colchester area
(telephone service, twelve step list, public information work, GSR,
secretary and treasurer at several meetings, tea/coffee maker, sponsor),
despite having started a new meeting and gone the extra mile on numerous
occasions covering others' commitments, the only response from the true
believers has been for one of our more 'eccentric' local members to bombard
me with emails quoting AA pamphlets and accusing me of being divisive.
Needless to say gossip is rife.
<p>
The funny thing is I'm not bitter about this and I know the hurt (which is
natural) will pass. I have many true friends (some of whom are also escapees
from this ridiculous little cult) whose love is not conditional on our
agreement or beliefs and I know only too well the overwhelming power of the
12 step meme. I too have savaged dissenters both to their faces and behind
their backs because of the fear their words provoked in me. The reality for
me has been that old fashioned biblical pass time of shunning!

<p>
Ah well! The whole wide world beckons as never before..I've taken up
running, got closer to my beloved wife and started thinking about new career
choices. I feel responsible and whole and adult and I'm 42 years old in 2
weeks! I've taught myself HTML and have even started tinkering with the UNIX
in hearts of my beloved Macs (now I KNOW I'm not powerless!!!) &#8212; what I'm
trying to say is that AA for me has been such a little, restricted world
despite its claim to be a program that cannot be outgrown. Thanks again for
your site and your commitment to publishing readers' letters, it's a
constant source of inspiration to read about others and their journeys.

<p>
Enjoy

Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on your new freedom.
<p>
It is sad how those &quot;true friends&quot; in A.A. will drop you like a hot potato if you
go your own way. They just can't stand that. You just can't be independent and live your
own life as you choose. And that is Exhibit Number One of why A.A. really is a cult.
<p>
And yes, the letters that come to me are just a river
of good stories. (As well also being the complaints of some very unhappy
true believers who squack when somebody dares to criticize their favorite panacea.)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

Date:  	Tue, July 11, 2006 2:49 am<br>
From:  	&quot;Larry&quot; <br>
Subject:  	still doing research . . .<br>

<p>

I was ready to check myself into an intensive outpatient program for my
problems with alcohol except for one minor detail.

<p>

But a funny thing (or not so funny) happened once I got there. The
contract I had signed and the terms that I had agreed to when meeting
with the intake person came into question. I had no problem with
agreeing to be sober and drug free. I had no problem submitting to urine
analysis and breathalyzer tests prior to sessions. I signed and agreed
to those and other stipulations presented to me and faced those harsh
realities with no fear but rather with self-assuredness, knowing that I
would have no problem achieving those results.

<p>

However, one of the clauses in the contract stated that it was
&quot;recommended&quot; that I attend AA meetings three times a week. I
specifically brought the word &quot;recommended&quot; up with the intake person at
the time of our discussions and had made it clear to her that I
interpreted that as meaning it was not mandatory, but as the word
suggested, optional. I explained to her that I was agnostic/atheistic
and that the 12 step programs were probably not for me.  I signed that
portion of the contract dealing with AA based on the word &quot;recommended,&quot;
though I told her I would look into the Quad As groups,
(Agnostic/Atheist Alcoholics Anonymous) but was not committing to going
to three meetings a week.  I was willing to give one a try, and had
planned on attending a meeting  just to see what they were all about.

<p>

When I mentioned my concerns regarding these meetings to the counselor I
met with  fifteen minutes prior to me starting my program, she said she
had never had to face this issue before. She said it was &quot;mandatory&quot; for
me to attend three meetings a week. I explained to her that the contract
that I had signed said &quot;recommended.&quot; Then she asked me to pee into a
cup, which I did. When I returned, she was gone. She returned with
another counselor, who asked me to step into a closed door office. He
then began to scold me, telling me that I was had a disease that I was
going to die from and that I had to change my way of thinking.

<p>

&quot;That's why I am here,&quot; I said. &quot;But my disease is not so bad that I do
not know what I signed my own name to.&quot;

<p>

I asked him to take a look at the contract I had signed. He said he
didn't care what the contract said, and that it was mandatory for me to
attend three AA meetings a week. I suggested that he look into having
the contract changed and I asked for a refund of my money.

<p>

Call it being nit picky. Call it being too hung up on details. Call it
avoidance or denial if you want. But needless to say, I am not
participating in that program.

<p>

I am still doing research, trying to find the best alternative for me.
Your article is part of my research.

<p>

I have only completed about half of the article (I will finish it
tomorrow) and to be honest, I do not totally agree with everything in
your article, but it sure rang truer to me than most of the propaganda I
have been reading lately.

<p>

I have been sober for a week and a half. I have promised myself to stay
sober until I can resolve the issue. Your article has helped me along
the path toward understanding and maybe even sobriety, though it will do
little to calm the nerves of my parents, friends and relatives. Most
importantly, I think my wife will understand your point of view.

<p>

I am sure you have had to put up with all sorts of negative feedback
from many circles, but here's one reader who though doesn't agree with
everything you said, will try to find the pearls of wisdom you are
trying to impart and if nothing else &#8212; stay away from AA and those
associated with the program.

<p>

Thanks

<p>

Hi Larry,
<p>
Congratulations on your new sobriety. You have already quit;
now all that you have to do is stay quit.
The very first thing you should do is read this file on
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
That information has been a huge help to me in preventing relapses.

You might also want to check out this list of discussions of what works,

<p>
And congratulations on your escape from that so-called &quot;treatment program&quot;.
Isn't it really disgusting how the treatment centers
pull that bait-and-switch trick? They advertise a treatment program for alcoholism, and then
it is just
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;go to three A.A. meetings a week.&quot;</font>
And you are supposed to pay money for them sending you to A.A. meetings.
What a con. (I got the same instructions in my &quot;treatment&quot; experience. See
<a href="orange-intro.html">my introduction to &quot;A.A. treatment&quot;, here</a>.

Hi John,
<p>
Well, you can pray for me all you like, but A.A. did not save your life.
You did, by quitting drinking. All that A.A. does is steal the credit for the sobriety
of a few people who were going to quit drinking anyway.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">A.A. does not work at all</a> &#8212; A.A. just

[2nd letter from John:]
<p>
Date:  	Thu, July 13, 2006 3:55 am<br>
From:  John R.	

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
Thank you for your reply.  Briefly, let me just say that  I do understand
where you are coming from... I really do. I do agree with some of  the things that
you say about AA.  There are some things I truly cannot  stand about AA.
<p>
However, when I say that AA saved my life, it did this for  me... AA introduced me
to my Higher power... it helped me form a relationship  with my God that until
the age of 43 I had never had. Also, when I stopped  drinking and knew that I
would be doing prison time, AA gave me a safe  place to go so I would not get
into any more trouble and I was in. Also,  AA helped develop truly lasting
friendships that last  till this day.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, John,
<p>
So what you are saying is that A.A. is a pleasant religion and a nice church
that gives you some comfort.
<p>
But A.A. is advertised on the radio and TV as a cure or treatment for alcoholism.
That is
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spirit_rel">a bait-and-switch trick</a>.
<p>
And when judges sentence
people to A.A. meetings, it isn't because A.A. is a nice religion. (Or it isn't supposed
to be because A.A. is a nice religion.)
</font>

<p>
Now, for you to try to stigmatize this
as saying that  AA is a cult... well... you know what they say about people and
opinions...
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is an attempt to use the propaganda technique called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a> &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It's just my opinion versus your opinion.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
Actually, I have a lot of facts, not just opinions.
That is the difference.
</font>
<p>
<a name="obsess"> </a>
I do  want to ask you some questions.... how many meetings have you
attended and why  are you obsessed with trying to knock down something that
certainly does  help people...
<p>
<font color="blue">
Whoa! Slow down. That is two totally different questions packed together.
<p>
1. I've been to more A.A. and N.A. meetings than I can count.
Read the introduction to the web site. Heck, read all of the autobiographical
material,
<a href="orange-letters58.html#autobio">here</a>.
<p>
2. I am not
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;obsessed with trying to knock down something that
certainly does help people.&quot;</font><br>
I am interested in telling the truth about quackery
and fraud that kills more people than it saves.
<p>
A.A. is not a wonderful program that helps millions. It is a cult that kills people.
<a href="orange-letters57.html#defects">Here is the usual list</a>
of studies that have shown that A.A. makes alcoholics
worse, not better off.
</font>
<p>

even if it helps only 1000 people a year in the
entire  world  [I haven't even talked about all the 12 step programs that have
begun due to AA....Al-Anon, NA, etc...] what is the big problem?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, gee, what if it only kills 6000 people while saving 1000 people?
What's the big problem?
<p>
That is the ratio that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, who is still a member of the Board of
Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous, got when he tried to prove that A.A. works.
After 8 years of A.A. treatment,
the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was:<br>
5 sober, 29 dead, 66 still drinking.<br>
That is nearly a 6-to-1 kill ratio.
<p>
And a success rate of 5% is just the same as
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">the normal rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholics</a>.
That is how many will just
quit, alone, all of their own, without any help. That means that the real A.A. success rate,
above spontaneous remission, is zero. Like Dr. Vaillant concluded, A.A. was completely
ineffective.
<p>
A.A. just steals the credit from some people who quit drinking by their own perseverance
and hard work.
</font>
<p>

Why are you telling people that AA is a cult, which it's not,
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. most assuredly is a cult. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>, the whole thing, questions
and answers. Then we can discuss specifics.
</font>
<p>

but why do you spend your
valuable time trying to put down AA when it certainly does help people?
<p>
<font color="blue">
It doesn't help people. A.A. kills more people than it saves. We've just been through that.
Refusal to see the facts, going into denial and parroting slogans and dogma
and actually reversing reality is another sign of a cult.
<p>
If you think that A.A. actually works and saves lives, then please answer just this one
simple question:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Out of each 1000 newcomers to Alcoholics Anonymous, how many will pick up a
10-year coin for sobriety?&quot;
</font>

</font>
<p>

If
someone told me that standing on my head and rubbing my belly would ASSIST  me
to stop drinking and assist me in getting a life that I never  had....then
I'll stand on my head and rub my belly!

<p>
<font color="blue">
And if someone tells you to drink the koolaid because it will really help you
to be spiritual, will you drink it?
</font>
<p>

This is what I don't understand....I really don't..This is why  I feel that
you need someone to pray for you, as we all do!

<p>

John

<p>
<font color="blue">
John,
<p>
My respect for the truth and love of the truth does not mean that I need to pray to
a doorknob or a bedpan or a Group Of Drunks.
(You know, in A.A., &quot;G.O.D.&quot; = &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;)
<p>
As a matter of fact, Jesus said, &quot;Learn the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot;
What a coincidence! I learned the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism, addiction,
and recovery, and now I am recovered and free.

<p>
Have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange:

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, John,
</font>

<p>
RE:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
So what you are saying is that A.A. is a pleasant religion and a  nice church
that gives you some comfort.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I never said that Orange, nor do I think  it.  AA is not to me a religion or
a &quot;nice church&quot;..why are you putting  words in my mouth.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I was not putting words into your mouth. You specifically said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;AA introduced me to my Higher power... it helped me form a
relationship with my God that until the age of 43 I had never had. &nbsp; ...
&nbsp; AA gave me a safe place to go...&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

That is a religion, and that is a church.
<p>
You may deny that A.A. is a religion, but it is. Anything that talks
about God that much, and works so hard to convert people to Bill Wilson's religious beliefs,
is a religion. You got converted, didn't you? That in itself is proof.
</font>

<p>

RE:

<font color="blue">
2. I am not &quot;obsessed with trying to knock down something that certainly
does help people.&quot;<br>
I am interested in  telling the truth about quackery and fraud that kills
more people than it saves.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


I have been attending AA for 9 years...I do NOT personally know of  one
single person that has been &quot;killed&quot; by AA...maybe i'm just on a different  planet
then you are?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Or maybe you don't bother to actually keep track of the A.A. dropouts, relapsers and failures.
You have to count everybody who comes to the meetings, not just the success stories
who keep coming back.
And the county coroner's office isn't going to call you and tell you
that one of your group members died or committed suicide.

<p>
Again, your failure to see is not proof of anything.
As Carl Sagan said, &quot;Absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence.&quot;
</font>
<p>

<br>
RE:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
That is the ratio that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who is still a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics
Anonymous, got when he tried to prove that  A.A. works. After 8 years of A.A.
treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first  100 alcoholic patients was:<br>
5 sober, 29 dead, 66 still drinking.<br>
That is  nearly a 6-to-1 kill ratio.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Orange...where is your logic?  Are you telling me that these 29 dead  people
died because they attended AA meetings? If you are, and the way i read  this
statement....you are stating that...that is absolutely insane for you to  make
such comment, that because these 29 people attended AA meetings and died
[hell, they could have died because they just died...we don't know] and there's
your proof that AA doesn't work...that argument is comical!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you are beginning to realize why you need a control group &#8212; some other group with
which to compare results. Alcoholics Anonymous happily claims all of the sober people as
its success stories, but disavows any responsibility for the failures and deaths.
<p>
You always have to ask,
<ol>
<li> &quot;How many of them would have quit drinking alone, without A.A.?&quot; and also,
<li> &quot;How many of them would have died anyway, without A.A.?&quot;
</ol>
You get the answers to those questions by having some other group of
alcoholics with which to compare the A.A. group.

<p>
Obviously, you did not read about Dr. Vaillant's work. You should have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">followed that
link</a>, and read the whole thing about Dr. Vaillant and CASPAR, the
Cambridge-Sommerville [Massachusetts] Program for Alcohol Rehabilitation.
In his book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Vaillant">
<b><i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i></b></a>,
Dr. Vaillant explained how he studied several other methods of treating alcoholism,
gleaning information from 40 years of the professional literature on alcoholism, while
he spent the better part of 20 years treating alcoholics with the Alcoholics Anonymous
program.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous had the highest death rate of any of the treatments that Vaillant
studied. The A.A. death rate of 29% was anything from
128% to 580% of the other programs' death rates.
Nothing killed more alcoholics than Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
At that point you have to recognize that A.A. is doing something very bad to the alcoholics.
<p>
And mind you, Prof. Dr. Vaillant absolutely loves A.A. and did everything in his power
to make A.A. look good. There is a reason why he is on the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous. Prof. Vaillant even says that A.A. is a cult, but he thinks that it
is a very nice cult, one that everybody should join.

<p>
And when you get done with Dr. Vaillant, you can read about these other doctors who
did careful controlled studies that also found that A.A. was doing terrible things to
alcoholics:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a>
found that having a doctor talk to the patient for just one hour,
telling him to quit drinking, was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
</ol>

<p>
And I notice that you didn't answer that one simple question:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Out of each 1000 newcomers to Alcoholics Anonymous, how many will pick up a
10-year coin for sobriety?&quot;<br>
</font>
Come on. That really is the whole ball game. If A.A. doesn't make the
alcoholics get sober and stay sober, then what good is it?<br>
Is A.A. merely a pleasant religious social club where
you can watch the alcoholics relapse and die?
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the real Alcoholics Anonymous success rate?
</font>

</font>

<p>
<br>
RE:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
And if someone tells you to drink the koolaid  because it will really help
you to be spiritual, will you drink it?
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


Yes... Orange,  I was trying to be funny.  And yes..honestly,  if someone
told me to drink koolaid, and it proved to me that it would  help me be more
spiritual, enabling me to enjoy a intimate relationship with my  Higher Power.
And in doing this,  my life would improve beyond my  wildest
expectations...yes...I would drink the Koolaid...hopefully it would be  Cherry flavor!

<p>
<font color="blue">
I will let that stand as is. What can I say? &quot;He really will drink the koolaid.&quot;
</font>
<p>

I was not able to open some of your links... so I can not comment on what  you
were referring to in a more direct manner.
<p>
john

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't know for sure why you weren't able to open links. I can only guess that it is
because the stupid new ISP set a bandwidth limit on the web site after we told him that
it was going to get a whole lot of traffic. The limit kicked in sometime yesterday or last
night. I saw it at 6:30 AM this morning. The server stopped serving pages.
That limit was removed this morning. Try the links again.

For your information, the answer is &quot;neither&quot;.

But what does that have to do with the fact that

Subject:  	thank God for AA<br>

<p>
I just wonder why you feel such a need to attack AA. People who read your site could
NEVER come back to the program and die drunk. Thank God I was given the gift of
alcoholics anonymous that some drunks never even have the oppuritunity to have a
chance to walk in the door. I &quot;played around, did 1/2 measures&quot; of the program for 4
yrs, until I finally surrendered on 12/3/04 and have not had the obsession to drink
again, otherwise I am sure that I would be dead by now. I've never been more Happy
Joyous and Free in my life, not that every day is that way, but on days it's not AA
has given me the tools to pick up (if I choose to pick those up over a drink), and
some days just aren't going to be a bed of roses, thank God today I don't have to
drink over those things anymore...............and thank God for ALCOHOLICS
ANONYMOUS...........it works, IF you work it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Beth,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. The fact that you finally decided to quit drinking does not
mean that the A.A. program works. It just means that you finally
decided to really quit drinking.
<p>
And the fact that you are happy in A.A. does not necessarily make it a good organization.
<p>
Please read
<a href="orange-letters58.html#John_R">the letter that came in immediately
before yours</a>, where we discussed the same things.

Have a good day.

Date:  	Wed, July 12, 2006 2:41 am<br>
From:  	Sami K.<br>
Subject:  	Hello from Finland<br>

<p>
Hello Mr. Agent

<p>
Greetings from Finland and many thanks for opening my eyes. A year ago I
came to a conclusion that my drinking has to stop. Although I've never been
a daily drinker, I developed a drinking problem &#8212; once I got some alcohol in
me, I could not stop. I just got very tired of hurting myself.
<p>
From the beginning I have thought that quitting is a matter of will and I
CAN do something about it. But I have a friend, 9 years in AA, who has been
confusing me. He has told me I should come to meetings, because almost
nobody can quit on their own. He also told me I was heading for relapse or
end up a bitter &quot;dry-drunk&quot; &#8212; now I must say he didn't use the term &quot;dry
drunk&quot;, but from what I have read I'm sure that's what he meant.
<p>
And what
happened &#8212; I did relapse! Three times during this year I have given up to
&quot;the Beast&quot;. I don't blame anybody but myself about having those drinks, but
I must say this AA-propaganda has confused me a lot. After the latest
relapse about a month ago, I was very close to going to an AA-meeting. Then
I tried to get some ideas on the internet. First I found SMART and RR, then
I found your pages. WOW! I'm no longer confused! Thanks man!
<p>
I am now back
to where I started &#8212; I believe I can make it on my own. But I am no longer
uncertain and confused about that. I just have to kill that &quot;Lizard&quot; or
&quot;Beast&quot; (well, if not kill, at least keep it's filthy mouth shut).
<p>
We don't have very many alternatives to AA here, so I'm quite dependent on
the internet on these issues. We do have this system called &quot;A-clinic&quot;. It's
a state funded public service, but its main focus seems to be in detox
rather than total recovery.
<p>
Well that's about it. All the best to you &#8212; and write a book!

<p>
Sami

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sami,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story.
You sound like you have a good take on the situation.
I'm happy for you.
<p>
About alternatives, perhaps you will find something helpful in
<a href="orange-letters58.html#alt_list">this list, here</a>.
And don't miss this list of discussions of what has helped other people,
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works">here</a>.

<p>
Just one note: that stupid little lizard brain will never really quit talking and keep his mouth
shut. He kind of quiets down and isn't so obnoxious after a while, but he is never completely
silent. He will still pop up now and then all of a sudden, and say something like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Wouldn't it be fun to go out tonight and just smoke and drink and party with some pretty
girls just for the hell of it?&quot;
</font>

<p>
What I have learned to do is just not take him seriously. I just say to him,
<i>&quot;No. And that's a cute
trick, trying to tell me that I will get pretty girls if I smoke and drink. But it doesn't
really work that way. ... No, I don't feel like waking up tomorrow sick and hung over and with a
raspy throat that feels like I've been sucking on a blow-torch. And getting readdicted,
and going through hell again... Been there, done that. I am like so done with that.&quot;</i>

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Date:  	Tue, July 11, 2006 12:49 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Orange&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Works Publishing<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi. First, let me thank you for all of your good work in
getting the truth out about Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>

Then let me nit-pick one detail. In your web page,

<p>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://alcoholicsanonymous.9f.com/spirituality.htm#Big_Book_Copyright">
http://alcoholicsanonymous.9f.com/spirituality.htm#Big_Book_Copyright</a>

<p>

You state:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;1938 = Works Publishing Company, financed by Charles Towns and John
Rockefeller, is formed by Bill W. and Hank P., an unincorporated body to
own and publish  Alcoholics Anonymous, the book Bill W. and others are
writing.  It sells shares to various buyers.  Later the shares were sold
to The  Alcoholic Foundation, some for cash, others for notes and Bill's
for future royalties and the assumption of Bill's debts.  When the book
was complete, it was registered with the copyright office as the personal
property of William G. Wilson dba Works Publishing.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

Actually, that was Bill Wilson's standard lie, not the truth.
What was actually formed in 1938 was &quot;The 100 Men Corporation&quot;.
That is the entity in which stock subscriptions were sold, and
that is the entity that financed the writing of the Big Book.
See:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-prospectus.html#sub">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-prospectus.html#sub</a>

<p>

And also see:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-bigbook.html">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-bigbook.html</a><br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-aacoa.html">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-aacoa.html</a>

<p>

When Bill Wilson stole the copyright of the Big Book in 1939,
he wrote on the copyright application that the sole author of
the book was &quot;Wm. G. Wilson, trading as Works Publishing&quot;.
See:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-BB-cpyrite.gif">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-BB-cpyrite.gif</a><br>

There was no such business or organization in existence at
that time. Bill was just lying to steal the copyright from
the 100 Men Corporation.

<p>

Later on, other men created an actual incorporated corporation
called Works Publishing Inc.. They used the same name to avoid
making it too obvious that Bill Wilson had committed fraud.
They tried to gloss the whole thing over by implying that it
was just a change in the name of the business, which it was not.
In fact, Bill Wilson had to sign over the copyright from
his own &quot;Works Publishing&quot; to &quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot;.
See this:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221640/http://orange-papers.org/orange-BB-cpyrite3.gif">
http://orange-papers.org/orange-BB-cpyrite3.gif</a>

<p>

When Bill Wilson wrote the history of A.A., like in
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age&quot;, he carefully avoided
ever mentioning that the 100 Men Corporation even existed.
He always used the name &quot;Works Publishing&quot; in the place of
the 100 Men Corporation, which is just another one of his lies.

<p>
Have a good day.
