Some of the A.A. faithful are real fanatics when it comes to
medications; they want to pretty much ban them entirely. They
think that if you are taking anything at all that you are
just substituting one drug for another. They believe that people
should be able to recover from anything and everything with just
the Twelve Steps and God's help. In that respect, they are very
much like the Christian Scientists who won't go to the doctor, or
take their children to the doctor, even if they are dying.
Sometimes those A.A. fanatics do great harm, like when they tell
neophytes to stop taking their doctor-prescribed medications, and
the neophytes get sick, or worse.

I have even heard sponsors advising those they sponsor to refrain
from using medications that were prescribed by professionals
and, presumably, deemed necessary for the treatment of other
medical or psychological problems of the individuals.
Occasionally, sponsees will admit that they haven't informed their
sponsors of medically prescribed drugs they are taking for fear of
a critical response.
<p>
Medications of any kind are disparaged, and any diagnosis of
disorder other than the Big Book's disease concept of alcoholism
meets with strong opposition. The parallel with &quot;faith healing&quot;
should be obvious and the same pitfalls are present. To such
individuals, there is no such thing as clinical depression.
<p>
The many deaths that have been attributed to failure to obtain
adequate medical treatment observed among family members of
a number of &quot;natural&quot; religious groups comes to mind
as a parallel case. How many disasters, including death, has this
misguided practice of A.A. members contributed to? On what basis
do so many A.A. members assume that they are qualified to advise
on matters for which they have no training? The practice, as has
been noted, is in sharp contradiction to those Traditions that state
that we share only our experiences, strength and hopes with one
another, not our opinions.

The book <i>Alcoholic Thinking</i> reports:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One [member] mentioned sitting in a club just drinking &quot;another magic
cup of that coffee up there.&quot; Many others subscribe to the suggestion
in the Big Book that sweets curb the compulsion to drink and should be kept
on hand for that purpose. Some people suggest that you &quot;eat some
ice cream&quot;
whenever you feel like you need a drink. Quite a few people at the club
appear to have taken the suggestion of eating ice cream and other sweets
seriously.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Although stories of these types of folk cures abound among members of AA,
they are minor and for the most part are the only &quot;medicines&quot; that
are acceptable to most members. Ironically, any type of drug other than
caffeine and nicotine are looked on as mind-altering drugs and are to be avoided.
Some newcomers and a few regular members may quietly receive various mood-altering
prescription drugs from physicians, but this is not generally acknowledged.
Members are continuously warned that medicating one's feelings with any
type of drug is &quot;alcoholic thinking.&quot;
<a name="tobacco"> </a>
Many members are chain smokers
and coffee abusers, but these are not regarded by most AA members as
&quot;bad&quot; drugs of the mind-altering category, even though they
will readily admit that overindulgence of either one or both is
&quot;addictive&quot;
behavior and may be hazardous to health. Many people with longer
terms of sobriety quit using tobacco for precisely this reason, but
the basic attitude is that it's better to use coffee and cigarettes than
to drink. Such chemical substitution seems to be a contradiction to the
basic principles of the program, but there is considerable sentiment that
anything is better than drinking. Many experienced members will tell
newcomers to worry about the alcohol (and the &quot;bad&quot; mind-altering
drugs) for the first year or so, then tackle other dependencies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The negative attitude to other drugs is an interesting contrast to subjects
in third world populations when they are exposed to modern medicines and
how they respond to their availability. These populations seem to want
&quot;medicines&quot; not simply because they work, but because they
&quot;believe&quot; they work (Van Der Geest and Whyte 1989). AA members
claim to feel just the opposite. They tend to reject the belief that there
are <i>any</i> medicinal or drug substances that can help them and
insist that only a &quot;spiritual program&quot; can help them.
This tendency is reflected in an extreme form in a story told in a meeting
about a terminally ill cancer patient with over 25 years of sobriety who
refused pain-killing medications for agonizing months because he did
not &quot;want to throw away all&quot; his sobriety.<br>

</font>

<p>
But sometimes, the anti-drug fanaticism of the faithful reaches comic
proportions.
<p>
In the March 23, 1998 issue of <i>New Yorker</i> magazine,
David Samuels wrote an article titled, &quot;Saying Yes to
Drugs&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>

It starts with the hilarious story of
the coffee war at Hazelden. Hazelden is the richest, most
affluent, and most influential twelve-step-based drug and alcohol
treatment facility in the country. It should be rich, just a
28-day stay costs $15,000.
<font color="blue">
[Update: 2010.08.18: Now it's $26,000.<br>
Another update: 2015.10.07: Now it's $35,000 to $40,000.]
</font>

 In the spring of 1994, the faithful
counselors at Hazelden decided that coffee was a drug, just like
any other drug, and that it should be <i>strengsten
verboten</i>.
<p>
&quot;There was concern that some people could be using
coffee as a stimulant, three-bagging it, or four-bagging
it,&quot; Russell Forrest, one of the leaders of the anti-coffee
camp, recalled. &quot;What we were really dealing with, I guess,
was a question of philosophy.&quot;
<p>
A question of philosophy, indeed. The 12-Step religion has
become more
extreme in their opposition to any kind of mind-altering
chemicals
than even the Mormons or the Seventh Day Adventists.

<p>
Coffee was banned at Hazelden. This will undoubtedly strike
some people as both very extreme and very odd,
considering that coffee and
cigarettes have been considered essential elements of A.A. meetings
since the dawn of A.A. time, in Akron, Ohio. The A.A. faithful can
still make the pilgrimage to Akron, to see Doctor Bob's famous
coffee pot, the one with which he brewed up the coffee for the
original group of A.A. members. And Doctor Bob is often quoted as
saying, &quot;All we need for another meeting is a resentment and
a pot of coffee.&quot;
<p>
Bill Wilson was certainly not so fundamentally opposed to
drugs. He experimented with things like using vitamin B3
megadoses or LSD therapy as a treatment for alcoholism until the General
Services Board considered him to be an embarrassment, and asked
him to stop using the GSB for his return address. (Kind of
funny, isn't it? Bill creates them, and makes them what they
are, and then they tell him that he's embarrassing them, so
please go away.)
<p>
Nevertheless, at Hazelden, coffee had become an illegal
drug. But the coffeeholic patients did not go quietly into that
night. No, they decided to rage, rage, against the dying of the
light. People smuggled in coffee and coffee concentrates. When
patients' belongings were searched, very strange contraband
started showing up.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You had people bringing this stuff in from
outside,&quot; Forrest recalls, &quot;and there was an
underground market, which, of course, you would point out to
patients, and you'd say, you know, 'Doesn't this sound like
chemical use?' People were opening up packages, and I saw what
was in there. It was the strongest brew you could buy. Somebody
was getting coffee from South America, and it was sticky and
black, and I said, 'What is this? This is not Maxwell House from
Bogota.'&quot;<p>
</font></blockquote><p>
<i>Oh, my God, it's Black Tar Columbian! Not heroin, but coffee!</i>

<p>
<a name="ftnt07_ret"> </a>
<a href="#blackmarket">The black market</a>
(<i>pun!</i>) grew rapidly, and people were secretly
brewing up batches of coffee in their rooms, and then flushing
the incriminating evidence, the grounds, down sinks and toilets.
Pretty soon, the pipes were stuffed with coffee grounds, and
drains were backing up all over Hazelden. The conflict between the
fundamentalist approach to the tenets of A.A. and the practical
demands of running a treatment center came to a head. As the
plumbing at Hazelden became more and more clogged, the
maintenance staff rebelled. Finally, the coffee ban was
ingloriously rescinded, much to the consternation of some of the
staff, and those darned coffee addicts were able to get their
fixes again without being criminals.
<p>
<a name="traditional_treatment"> </a>
The author of the <i>New Yorker</i> article, David Samuels, pointed
out that the coffee war was happening at about the same time as
a much larger drug debate was happening at Hazelden. Foundation
President Jerry Spicer had begun to encourage the use of
antidepressant drugs, and other therapies that are not part of
the traditional twelve-step process. Thus Spicer was a
progressive, putting Hazelden at odds with more conservative,
fundamentalist, 12-Step facilities like the Betty Ford clinic.
And it put Spicer at odds with some of his own staff &#8212; half a
dozen counselors quit in protest when Spicer approved of the
anti-depressants. For them, allowing both coffee and anti-depressants
seems to have been just too much of a departure from a purely
spiritual treatment program.
<p>
President Spicer was actually hoping that there was some
progress being made in the area of treating alcoholism. He had
some reasons to be optimistic.

Alan Leshner was certainly
optimistic. Dr. Leshner was the head of the National Institute of
Drug Abuse, or NIDA, the federal agency that controls about 85%
of all government addiction-research funding. Leshner talked
about a new class of drugs, which are a consequence of recent
research into the way neurotransmitters in the brain affect
behavior, and how they will act on addiction in much the same way
as S.S.R.I.s (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors), like
Prozac and Zoloft, act on depression.
<p>
Leshner said, &quot;My belief is that today, in 1998, you
should be put in jail if you
refuse to prescribe S.S.R.I.s for depression. I also believe
that five years from now you should be put in jail if you don't
give crack addicts medications we're working on now.&quot;
<p>
Leshner continued, &quot;Look, if swinging a dead cat over your
head helps, then I'm all for it. But if someone says never, ever
use medications, I can't understand that at all.&quot;
<p>
<a name="Blum"> </a>
There has also been progress in understanding alcoholism.
There are an amazing number of people working on
different aspects of the problem, and coming up with results.
The whole area is very much in flux, and changing by the month.
The latest evidence shows that alcoholism may indeed have a
&quot;disease&quot; component,
just like A.A. has been saying all along. More and more,
the scientists are finding anomalies in the brain chemistry of
some alcoholics, and anomalies in their genes.
Scientists are making discoveries like finding that the A1 allele
of the dopamine receptor gene seems to play a large part in
susceptibility to alcoholism and drug addiction.
And the terms &quot;D2-D4&quot; and &quot;exon 3 of dopamine D4
receptor (DRD4)
gene&quot; are popping up more and more often in connection with
alcoholism.
There is mounting evidence that some alcoholics feel more pain and
less pleasure than other people, a condition that they try to fix
with alcohol or other drugs.
<p>
<a name="ftnt05_ret"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholism and some other addictions and compulsions have in
common the inability to achieve satisfaction from limited
quantities of a pleasure stimulus. This inability, &quot;reward
deficiency syndrome,&quot; is hard-wired into the brain and appears to
be linked to a genetic variation in the D2 receptor of chromosome 11.<br>

Just like the old Rolling Stones rock and roll song says,
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;I can't get no sat-is-fac-tion, Though I try and I try and I try...&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
For a bewildering overload of information, just use an Internet
search engine, and search for terms like &quot;alcoholism and allele&quot;,
or &quot;alcoholism and dopamine&quot;, or &quot;alcoholism and gene&quot;. The
results are so high-tech that a master's degree in biology or
biochemistry would help to understand it all, but it is there
anyway, and it indicates just how much work is being done on
solving the puzzle of alcoholism. This area of investigation is
hot, and a lot is happening fast, and new information is being
collected rapidly. The recent sequencing of the human genome has
added yet one more tool to the investigator's toolbox.
<p>
<a name="ftnt09_ret"> </a>
And very recently, there is evidence that
&quot;A Functional Neuropeptide Y Leu7Pro Polymorphism [is] Associated
With Alcohol Dependence in a Large Population Sample From the United
States&quot;. They say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;This is only the second specific
genetic mechanism ever identified that modulates risk for alcohol
dependence.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt09">9</a></sup></font>

<!------------
(See: <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>. 2002;59:825-831;<br>

http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html</a>)<br>
----------------->
They are getting there; they are closing in on the target.

<p>
And the evidence also suggests that there may eventually be
a cure for some people, or some kinds of &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
or at least an effective medical treatment.
We have reason to be optimistic. But that is a
direct violation of a dearly-held A.A.
tenet. One of the core components of A.A. dogma is the idea that
alcoholism is <b>incurable</b>. Because modern medicine has no
cure and
the situation is <b>hopeless</b>,
the only answer, they say, is to try the supernatural solution:
surrender yourself to God, and practice the Twelve Steps and go
to meetings forever, and hope that God will keep you sober.
<p>
<a name="ftnt06_ret"> </a>
But now modern medicine threatens to upset the apple cart.
<p>
Really, someone in A.A. should have seen this one coming. The A.A. <i>Big
Book</i> has always described alcoholism as a disease,<br>
<center>
<font size="+1">
<b>&quot;an actual disease that had a name and symptoms like diabetes or
cancer or TB.&quot;</b></font><br>
<font size="-1">
(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 227; 4th edition, page 205.)</font>
</center>

<p>
Well, we have medical treatments for all of those
other actual diseases, even cancer, and none of the treatments for
those other diseases involves prayer and confessions, or going to
meetings for the rest of your life... With those other &quot;actual&quot;
diseases, you don't see articles written by A.A. and N.A. boosters,
talking about the necessity of treating the patients' mind, body,
and spirit by sending the patients to A.A. and N.A. meetings for the
&quot;beneficial
effects&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font>
The <i>New Yorker</i>
article said that some people
are coming to believe that the Twelve-Step treatment for alcoholism
will soon be obsoleted. (No joke, and I'll add that some other people,
like
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#tokenism">the American Medical Association,
thought that it was &quot;obsolete&quot; quackery</a> the day that
it got started.)
<p>
This has happened before. There are numerous psychiatric diseases which
are no longer treated with the old &quot;traditional therapy.&quot;
Patients who used to lie on couches and get Freudian psychoanalysis
for $300 per hour now just pop a pill, and that takes care of their
problem.
For that matter, doctors are becoming increasingly aware of the fact
that a large percentage of &quot;alcoholics&quot; have underlying
medical or
psychiatric problems, problems which the patient was trying to fix
by self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, and
that the real cure consists of treating the underlying problems, rather
than just demanding total abstinence from drugs and alcohol.
And often, the real cure is just a bottle of pills &#8212; the right pills.
<p>
It was only a century or two ago when psychiatric patients were
given such &quot;treatments&quot; as the snake pit by the &quot;medical
experts.&quot;
Again, today, we use medications, instead of the snake pit, for those
problem mentally-ill patients.
<p>
Nevertheless, even today, we still have both TV evangelists
and Alcoholics Anonymous elders
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications">prescribing faith healing</a>,
rather than anything resembling medical treatment,
for various conditions, including alcoholism. And they jealously defend
their turf, and resist the intrusion of &quot;atheistic professionals.&quot;
<p>
I am getting feelings of <i>deja vu</i> all over again. Wasn't
this in a movie about a white doctor who went to the Dutch East Indies,
and got
into a battle with the local witch doctor over whose magic
really worked? The witch doctor was losing believers to the
western doctor every time the western guy healed somebody, and
the witch doctor didn't like that at all, so he conspired to kill
the white guys. See <i>The Spiral Road</i>, a novel by Jan
DeHartog, and a movie starring Burl Ives and Rock Hudson.<br>
<font size="-1">
(Available on late-night TV or at your local videotape rental
store. Warning: Over all, it's a pretty good movie, and the evil
witch doctor's scheme to kill the western doctors is fiendishly
clever and really spooky, but the ending features a hokey
religious conversion of the agnostic younger white doctor (Rock
Hudson) which is enough to make you gag. We just can't seem to
get away from somebody trying to convert us, can we? I mean,
really, how is it that there are so many people around with
nothing better to do with their lives than try to convert me to
their religion? What did they do for entertainment before I got
here?)
</font>

<p>
The high priests of A.A. don't want to discuss any new
developments. They don't want you to even hear about any new
treatments, never mind a cure. As Gary Persip points out in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160508132114/http://www.unhooked.com/sep/persip1.htm">
<i>Recovery From Addiction Without God?</i></a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The very A.A. Traditions that curtail members from presenting
information or sharing with one another from a &quot;professional&quot;
standpoint during meetings effectively act to keep A.A. groups
ignorant of current findings in addiction studies; they are
assumed to have no place in the program of recovery. This cry of
&quot;professionalism&quot; was originally designed to ensure the equality
of all participants in the program of recovery, A.A. traditionally
being based upon one drunk sharing his or her experience,
strength, and hope with another.
The current fellowship of A.A., however, has
diverged in so many regards from the original
program that any information that sounds as if it
were based upon professional opinion comes to be
regarded as suspect and is, therefore,
discouraged. Anything above the level of a
drunkalog is met with a stern admonition to
&quot;keep it simple.&quot; Neither is any
current information on addiction research
presented in the Grapevine, the official
publication of the organization. Dissident cries
from members, when permitted to be published, are
mild and fully supportive of maintaining the
traditional focus.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="ftnt08_ret"> </a>
And what if there is a cure for alcoholism?
Or even just an effective treatment? There will no
longer be any need to grovel before an authoritarian God for the
rest of your life. Just pop a pill. Why waste your time doing
the Twelve Steps, and forever listing and confessing all of your
faults and short-comings? Why waste a big chunk of the rest of
your life going to an endless series of meetings? Why make
yourself into a bombastic bonkers babbling brainless believer in a
crazy contentious cult? Indeed, if a
simple pill can fix the problem, why would anyone want to pay
Hazelden, or any other treatment facility, ten or fifteen
thousand dollars for a month of &quot;spiritual&quot; treatment
that <b>usually</b> fails to fix the
problem?<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt08">8</a></sup></font>
The A.A. Twelve-Step treatment program will be relegated to the trash heap
of history, along with other old medical treatments like
the snake pit, blood-letting, and leeches. The show is over, drop
the curtain, and would the last one out of the rooms please turn
off the lights?
<p>
No wonder the high priests of A.A. and their faithful
followers don't seem to want there to be a cure for alcoholism,
and they don't seem to want to see any new drugs used in the
treatment of alcoholism. They have no desire to see their game
end. They like the game. It has worked for them. They achieved
sobriety in it (<i>in</i> it; not necessarily <i>because of</i> it).
It has made them feel successful and important.
They have a lot of years invested in becoming a big frog in a small pond.
Many of them work the game, and make a living at it,
as &quot;12-Step rehabilitation counselors,&quot; and aren't qualified
to work at anything else...<br>
<font color="blue">
(That is not a joke: Being expert at parrotting 12-Step dogma and telling people to
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Do the 12 steps, get a sponsor, read the <i>Big Book</i>, and go to lots of meetings&quot;</i>
</font>
qualifies people for no other job besides &quot;counselor&quot; or
&quot;therapist&quot; in a 12-Step treatment facility.)<br>
</font>
The executives of AAWS make very comfortable livings from the game.
So the High Priests of A.A. continue to chant,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;There is no cure for
alcoholism. There will never be a cure for alcoholism. Nobody
ever recovers. Nobody ever graduates from this program. Just do
the Twelve Steps, and keep coming back to the meetings, forever. Amen.&quot;
</font>

<p>
But the chanting may come to an end. I hope the end comes soon.

<i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-Step Programs</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; James Christopher<br>
Prometheus Books, Buffalo, NY, 1992.<br>
ISBN: 0-87975-726-4<br>
Dewey: 362.2928 C556s<br>
This book is about
Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) a.k.a. &quot;Save Our Selves&quot;.
SOS is an alternative recovery method for those alcoholics or drug
addicts who are uncomfortable with the spiritual content of widely
available 12-Step programs. SOS takes a reasonable, secular approach
to recovery and maintains that sobriety is a separate issue from
religion or spirituality. SOS credits the individual for achieving and
maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any &quot;Higher
Power.&quot; SOS respects recovery in any form regardless of the path by
which it is achieved. It is not opposed to or in competition with any
other recovery programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Especially check out the interview with Kenneth Blum, titled
&quot;The Fickle Gene&quot;. Blum discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcoholism, and perhaps also a
tendency towards drug addiction.<br>

See <i>The Role of Spirituality in the Recovery Process</i>,
Paul DiLorenzo, Raymond Johnson, and Marian Bussey,
<b>Child Welfare</b>, Mar/Apr 2001, Vol. 80, Issue 2, p. 257, for a
classic example of this A.A.-booster school of literature.
<p>
After a confused look at the problem of drink- or drug-using
parents from the A.A. point of view,
including a section on &quot;Responding to the Spiritual
Crisis&quot; &#8212; not, &quot;Responding to the Emotional
Crisis&quot; or &quot;the Psychological Crisis&quot; or &quot;the Mental
Crisis&quot;, just &quot;the Spiritual Crisis&quot;
&#8212; the authors conclude that &quot;spiritual practices&quot;
like attending A.A. or N.A. meetings will help the patients.
<p>
The article features such ridiculously lame pseudo-science as
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The cerebrum and cerebral cortex (white matter) make the human
brain unique and
are the source of our abilities to understand, communicate, and
create [Ornstein &amp;
Thompson 1984]. The white matter assists in making decisions and
explains much of
the human behavior patterns.
</font></blockquote>
<p>
I guess the
authors would be surprised to learn that all great apes' brains
have a cerebrum and a cerebral cortex.
The only thing we have
over the rest of the great apes is larger pre-frontal lobes.
<p>
And somehow, I think that the chimpanzees, orangutans, and
gorillas who are fluent
in sign language will put up quite an argument about just how
unique human brains are, and how only humans have &quot;white
matter&quot; and how only humans can understand, communicate, and create.
Those great apes do those tasks all of the time.
If you really try to convince them that they can't think, one of
them will probably just tell you to
&quot;<a href="orange-gorilla.html">stick it
in your ear</a>,&quot; which
is the gorilla equivalent of &quot;up yours.&quot;

<b>&quot;The black market&quot;:</b> Does anyone else notice the obvious
similarity to the War on Drugs here? The counselors at Hazelden
did, but only from the viewpoint of wanting to ban coffee,
and complaining that the smuggling and illicit trade in coffee
sure resembled dope dealing.
<p>
The truth is, people want what they want, and will find a way to get it.
The Hazelden coffee prohibition failed for pretty much the same
reasons as the current War on Drugs is failing. Where there is
a demand, an unfulfilled desire, there is a market and a profit
to be made. Someone will supply the desired item and pick up the
money, always. That's just how the world works. It's nothing short
of amazing how our stupid politicians have not been able to learn
that one simple lesson in the seventy years since they repealed
alcohol prohibition (because it had failed, in the same way, for
the same reason),
and then instituted prohibition of all other intoxicating,
euphoric, or exhilarating drugs.

<a name="Moyers"> </a>
<a href="#ftnt08_ret">8</a>)
David Samuels' <i>New Yorker</i> article talked
at length about Bill Moyers and his
<i>Addiction</i> series on PBS. Moyer's son, William Cope Moyers,
had a cocaine habit for which he was treated at Hazelden, twice.
When the elder Moyers did his PBS series, he was very enthusiastic about Hazelden
and 12-Step treatment, and described it in very positive terms.
Hazelden took $30,000 from
Bill Moyers for baby-sitting his son for two months, and filling his
head with twelve-step nonsense.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Unfortunately, the 12-Step &quot;treatment&quot; didn't work at all.
The son relapsed after both of the Hazelden &quot;treatments&quot;.
And then he relapsed
after a couple of other treatment facilities' &quot;treatments&quot; too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It's a shame that Moyers hasn't done an honest sequel to the series,
telling us what the results of that extremely expensive
&quot;treatment&quot; actually were.
I would like to hear him say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;It was all a big hoax.
All they did was cheat me out of $30,000.<font size="-1"><sup>00</sup></font>.
Their 'treatment' accomplished nothing.&quot;</font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If Moyers would like, I'll treat his son at my
<a href="orange-jokes.html#Dr_Ngobo"><b><i>Papa Doc Orange's
Voodoo Clinic and Souvenir Emporium</i></b></a>
for only $10,000 per month.
Our excellent &quot;spiritual&quot; treatment program specializes
in performing acupuncture on voodoo dolls. It never fails, if you
work the program right.... It works if you work it....<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What is strangest of all, is that Bill's son did finally quit cocaine and get his
life together on his own (just like G.W. Bush).
Then he got a job at Hazelden as a P.R.
spokesman, and is now busy telling everybody how wonderful Hazelden
and 12-Step treatment really is, and how much it helped him. Go figure.
