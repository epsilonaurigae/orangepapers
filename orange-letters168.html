<p>
Terrance,

<p>
Great website you've created, I've been reading it all week :)

<p>
I have a theory I call the &quot;CD Theory&quot; &#8212; for Compensating Depression.  The idea is
that for every euphoric experience created by drinking alcohol, there is a
compensating depression, a form of payment extracted by mother nature.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ken,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliment.
<p>
That CD theory sounds about right. There is a crash after every drug high. Sometimes
the crash is very mild, like with pot and acid. And sometimes the crash is hellish,
like with speed. But it just seems like you can't get something for nothing.
</font>
<p>
Also, I was wondering if you believe the Lizard Brain can be equated to the Freudian
concept of the &quot;Id&quot;, and the higher mind, the one that is needed to overpower the
Lizard Brain, is equated to the concept of the Freudian &quot;Superego&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hmmm. I had not thought of that connection before. That makes sense. I think Freud
was talking about the same thing, just interpreting the animal drives of the
base brain through the filter of Victorian morality.  And now the Medieval image
comes to mind &#8212; believing that people had a devil and an angel inside, fighting
for supremacy.
Funny how we keep coming back to that same dichotomy.
</font>
<p>
Keep up the good work at the website :)

<p>

Okay, I will.

Orange,

<p>
So much hate directed at one target.  AA is having it's International convention in
San Antonio in July and 75,000 to 100,000 will attend.  It will be the largest
convention in San Antonio's history as it was in Seattle, San Diego, Minneapolis,
and Montreal.  People will attend from all over the world.  Millions would of course
disagree with your characterization of AA including Judges, Clergy, lawyers,
engineers, Doctors, professional people, laborers of all ilk, all the way down to
people living on Skid Row.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Well, you are starting off by using the A.A. father Dr. Frank Buchman's favorite
propaganda trick:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2numbers" target="newwin271">Appeal to Numbers
(<i>Argumentum ad Numerum</i>)</a>. Buchman was always claiming that the large
numbers of people who attended his meetings and conventions proved that he
was right about everything.

<p>
So, you are going to a convention. So what? Lots of organizations have conventions.
Haven't you seen the videos of Tom Cruise working a Scientology convention?
Search on YouTube. It's quite a show.

<p>
And here is an old favorite:

I'm sure that they rave about how wonderful their conventions are too.

You have quite a large site.  You know if I was convinced that horse shit was brown
I would not devote my life to trying to convince people I was right.   Of course I
am 25 years sober, retired with a great family a solid financial portfolio and not
living on the streets in Portland Oregon for the last 9 years.  My life I have
because of AA.  Would you say your life is because of your philosophy.  Let's see.
A life of comfort and joy vs a life of discomfort and anger.  I think I will take
mine.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I spent 3 months looking for another apartment, not 9 years.
<p>
And your moral standards are apparently determined by wealth and comfort. So rich people
are more virtuous than poor people because the rich people have more luxuries?
That attitude is so anti-Christian and fascistic that it warrants no further criticism.
<p>
Congratulations on your 25 years of sobriety.

Wow!  I've been studying your site awhile and am so sad.  Why would  
anybody wish to viciously put something down that has helped so many  
people?  I'm sorry you had a bad experience.  Of course there are some  
sick people in this program. They obviously are not working the  
steps.  There are sick people EVERYWHERE - in every organization,  
religion or institution.  That doesn't mean that the organization,  
religion, etc. is bad as a whole.  Don't condemn it all because of a  
few bad eggs.  I mean, come on!  Besides, this obsession of yours is  
killing you.  Why invest so much energy on something you don't fully  
understand?  Sure you've done some research.  So what?  I can  
manipulate any study, any story, any statistic into what I want it to

Hi Traci,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I have already found peace.
<p>
The simple facts of the matter are that A.A. does not
work to make alcoholics quit drinking, and A.A. lies about that a lot.

<p>
Everything else is minimization and denial, and rationalization, and trying to
avoid the point.
<ul>
<li> It is not a matter of me &quot;having had a bad experience&quot;.
<li> It is not a matter of people &quot;not working the Steps right&quot;.
<li> It is not a matter of &quot;There are sick people EVERYWHERE&quot;.
</ul>

<b>A.A. doesn't work to make alcoholics quit drinking. Period.</b>

<p>
This statement of yours is true:
<font color="black">
&quot;I can manipulate any study, any story, any statistic into what I want it to mean...&quot;
</font>
<p>
Yes, that is exactly what Alcoholics Anonymous does to create the
appearance of a good organization that actually sobers up
a lot of alcoholics. But it still isn't true.

Subject:  	AA Does it work<br>

<p>
I find it truly amazing that you have devoted such a large part of your life trying
to prove to yourself and others that AA does not work.  Let me give you a bit of my
own experience.  My experience is that Alcoholics Anonymous works and it works 100%
of the time.  As our Big Book states there are many other ways to get and stay sober
and AA does not have the only way.  Tearing down our successful program does not
elevate another.  Millions of people worldwide attest to the success of AA.
According to you they must all be wrong.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You have to be lying with qualifiers to claim that A.A. works 100% of the time.
Obviously, you are not counting all of the people who come to A.A. seeking some
kind of help or answers. You are only counting the ones that you like to count.
<p>
Again, you are trying the
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2numbers" target="newwin271">appeal to numbers</a>&quot;
trick:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Millions of people worldwide attest&quot;...<br>
</font>
But since there are only 2 million A.A. members in the whole world, and 95% of them
will drop out without getting a one-year sobriety medallion, your statement
cannot possibly be true.
So A.A. is not &quot;a successful program&quot;. It is just a successful cult.
</font>

<p>
I have been sober for 24 years in the program of AA.  I have never met one person
who has honestly taken the 12 steps with the assistance of a sponsor who had a
sponsor and then continued to live within those 12 steps who has ever taken another
drink or used a drug.  It simply does not happen.  Those who do drink or use have
not been failed by the program.  They have failed by not adhering to the program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="newwin271">cherry-picking</a>
and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="newwin272">lying with qualifiers</a>.
Only those people who quit drinking are, in your opinion, &quot;honest&quot;.
<p>
And you couldn't be doing a better job of parrotting the cult dogma:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The program is perfect. It's just the people who fail the program.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Congratulations on your 24 years. (Not 25? You said 25 above.)
That makes you one of the respected old-timers, doesn't it?
So why aren't you using your position and influence to fix what is wrong with A.A.?
How about stopping the sexual exploitation of underage girls in
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin255">Mike Q.'s group</a>?
Or Clancy's?
Why don't you do that?
</font>

</font>
<p>
The 12 steps are a way of life.  As long as a person sticks to that way of life they
stay sober and their lives improve.  I read a number of the letters and more letters
and did not find one letter from anyone who was failed by AA.  They all failed
because like you they abandoned AA.  Sobriety is a bi-product of right living and
the 12 steps are a way to live right.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin243">The Twelve Steps are Dr. Frank Buchman's practices</a>
for producing well-indoctrinated members of a fascistic cult.
</font>
<p>
You like to quote statistics and as you know given a set of numbers I can prove any
side of any argument.  The old adage that figures lie and liars figure is
appropriate.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, that is not true at all. You cannot &quot;prove&quot; anything you wish with numbers, not
without lying and deception and bad mathematics.
Proper mathematics is a very good way to find the truth.
</font>
<p>

The Big Book speaks of a 75% success rate and those like you love to
debate that number but it is not debatable.  The 75% rate is followed by three
critical words &quot;and really tried.&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, like I have said so many times, Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="newwin272">lying with qualifiers</a>
when he wrote that.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="newwin276">That is a grossly dishonest
statement, a complete fraud</a>.
Bill Wilson's intention was to fool people into thinking that A.A. actually worked,
which it did not.
</font>
<p>

  Does that mean 75% of the people who walk into
an AA meeting stay sober?  Of course not.  That is not what our book claims.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, but that is what Bill Wilson implied. It's just like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;
</font>
What Bill did not write is that, in his opinion,
very very few people ever &quot;thoroughly followed his path&quot;.
<p>
And you old-timers won't tell the newcomers the truth about that, either.
When is the last time that you told a bunch of newcomers that the odds of them
getting a 20-year coin are less than one in a thousand?

</font>
<p>

AA meetings are but a small part of the program of AA.  There are meetings, the
fellowship, the common bond, the Big Book, the 12 steps and the sharing of AA all of
which are parts of the program.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, there are lots of cult activities to keep you busy.
It's just like the fundamentalist Christian cults with Bible study, and prayer meetings,
and lectures, and church services, and conventions, and meetings, and recruiting,
and more Bible study, and more recruiting...

</font>
<p>

Those who fail in AA fall into three basic groups:
<ul>
<li>
1. People who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program
<li>
2. People who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves
<li>
3. People who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders.  Every letter on your
site which I read where someone claims that AA does not work and did not keep them
sober falls into one of those three categories.  Those who got and stayed sober
without AA are to be commended.  We never debate that there are other successful
programs.
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue">
It's all the fault of those darned disgusting alcoholics that Frank Buchman's
Oxford Group cult practices don't cure alcoholism, isn't it?
<p>
That is, of course, total baloney, just more standard cult dogma.
But after 24 years, I'm sure that you have it all memorized, and can recite
A.A. scriptures all day long, right?
</font>
<p>
There is absolutely nothing I have read on your site that disproves that AA works
for those who honestly work it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is lying with qualifiers. You have to always tack on those qualifiers
to the ends of your sweeping declarations &#8212; &quot;those who honestly work it&quot;.
<p>
And please show me where, in the official A.A. literature, we see the test that
determines whether an A.A. member is rated as &quot;honestly working it&quot;.
(Or would that be &quot;taking someone's inventory&quot;?)
<p>
So how do you decide whether someone is &quot;honestly working it&quot;?
Don't you just look at whether he is drinking?
<ul>
<li>
If he is drinking, then he must not be honestly working it, right?
<li>
And if he is sober, then he must be honestly working it, right?
<li>
So 100% of the people who, in your opinion, are &quot;honestly working it&quot;,
are sober.
</ul>
<p>
Talk about loopy circular logic.


</font>
<p>

Your way of thinking has gotten you what?  You are
an angry unsuccessful homeless person who does not drink or smoke tobacco.  You have
developed an antipathy to those in AA who are successful, homeowners who are
financially stable with wonderful friends and families.  Why is it that you dislike
these people so much?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alcoholics Anonymous foists harmful quack medicine on sick people, and lies about
its success rate in curing alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
A.A. hurts a lot of people.
<p>
And again, you appeal to materialism: 
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Your way of thinking has gotten you what?&quot;
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
Hmm, no millions, no split-level house in suburbia, no 401K, no financial stability.
He must not be moral... God must not like him. Maybe he should try selling his soul to the
Devil in trade for sobriety. That's highly profitable.
</i></font>


</font>
<p>
<a name="millions2"> </a>
I wish you only the best but perhaps your life would go better if you channeled your
energy into a positive rather than a negative endeavor.  You are obviously quite
bright and it is sad that you have wasted so much of your life trying to disprove
that AA actually has worked for millions of people.  If all of the time you have
spent on this task were directed toward positive things I would surmise you would
not be homeless or living hand to mouth as you are.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Getting rid of bad quackery is a good thing to do.
We wouldn't be half as healthy as we are if we had not gotten rid of a lot of quackery
and bad medical practices.
<p>
And again, you mention the homelessness. You seem to be delighted that I lost my
apartment and had to find another one. Apparently, in your moral system,
losing an apartment equals being wrong about everything in life.
And you are also happy to mention the fact that I am not rich.
That is a very, very strange morality that you have there.
Is that what you call &quot;spirituality&quot;? It sounds much more like crass materialism:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The rich are morally superior to the poor. We are just a better class of people.
We are royalty, you know.&quot;<br>
</font>
 (Remember that scene in <i>Titanic</i>?)

</font>
<p>
I wish you continued sobriety but in conjunction with that I wish you a happy
prosperous life.  You obviously do not have the latter now.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I do. I am quite happy and contented with life.
Apparently you do not understand how someone can oppose and criticize evil without
being miserable. You should try it some time, and see how it feels.

I have a lot of friends in AA and alot of enemies too the haters despise me

your life, you dont have to believe in anything, and you dont need a sponsor

Maybe all you need is a few good non drinking non judgemental friends

<p>
I stay because I really enjoy making the Koolaide drinking Orgasmic God
Calling Spiritually Awakened Buddahs squirm especially if I get to chop up
the dogma and disagree in a public forum ,,, Ive saved a few New People from
really drinking koolaide ,,, especially along the lines of family seperation
tactics, life micro management, practicing medicine without a license, etc etc

<p>
I stay because I dunno maybe I just like starting shit honestly I hope I
dont have the Narsasitic Complex you describe in Bill but I stay ,,, cause
maybe I can help one person from getting totally destroyed by some weird ass
cult member buddah you have no idea how much some of them hate me ...but I,m
not drinking having a great time and enjoy fucking with them because they
are not Gods and i,m long around enough to know where all the bodies are

So thank you for the good things you do to help the newcomers.

Hello Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
And here we go again with the same old line, the biggest Big Lie of Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. is not &quot;working for many people&quot;. A.A. is a failure that merely claims the
credit for some people getting their lives together and saving themselves.

Wow,
You must have had some major problems in AA or NA and still carrying
some pretty huge resentments?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, wanting to get the truth out there is not &quot;a resentment&quot;.
<p>
And resentments are not the cause of alcoholism or addictions, either.
That is just some more 12-Step cult nonsense from Bill Wilson's ravings.

I am not afraid to notice the A.A. and N.A. failure rate, and tell the truth
about it. I also have 9 years clean and sober now, so I'm not making excuses.
What are you talking about?

<p>
Yes there are some wankers in AA, but there are many in life too....<br>
Yes there are many egomaniacs in AA....same in life<br>
Many people get into AA and get forced to go with certain
sponsors....told these sponsors are good etc....but the sponsor is
existing on his reputation only....probably because he has sponsored
untold people??? It does not mean he is any good, or even is an
alcoholic.....as most people in AA probably do not even know what one
is???
<p>
<font color="blue">
You do realize, don't you, that that whole rap is just so much minimization and
denial?
<p>

<p>
I know from my own experience that there are troubles and divides in
AA, but the really spiritual thing to do is not to knock them, but to
try and pass the real message and be a real example and show real
humility??? Maybe I am wrong and you are right, who knows?
<p>
<font color="blue">
What &quot;real message&quot;. Lying to newcomers about how well
 &quot;the Program&quot; works is not &quot;spiritual&quot;. Nor is it
 showing &quot;real humility&quot;. Real humility is
admitting that you don't have any magic answers, and that you have been
wasting your time foisting a hoax on sick newcomers.
</font>
<p>
I for one never tell or order sponsors to do anything.....when they
make a decision to believe in their god....it is just that...their god
and I am not god, so can not and will not instruct them to do anything
realted to that...it is personal.
<p>
My god is not religious and never will be, some people believe in
religion and if it works for them good luck to them and no they should
not force it on newcomers.....attraction rather then promotion???

When you say

From:  	&quot;Elizabeth R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Trapped by AA and government<br>

<p>
It takes me a moment to get to the point but I do.

<p>
I have been reading your website and it helps validate what I think and
keeps me from falling for the brainwashing that I am currently getting.  I
just wonder why there is not more information like this out there.  I have
been  searching around desperately for another way to conquer my addiction
that was not AA, twelve step or disease orientated.   I played with rational
recovery but I lost my focus and descended deeper into addiction. My second
DUI worked. I sobered up and quit taking the prescription drugs that started
the whole mess.
<p>
  In order to get my license back in SC I have to go through
their program.  I was ready for that since there was no doubt in my mind
that I needed help and should face the consequences of my actions.  I was
completely honest when I was evaluated by a counselor who by the initials at
the end of her name couldn't qualify to counsel my dog.  I didn't know that
then, I trusted that the system had my best interest and the safety of
others in mind.  It didn't occur to me at the time that my insurance card
was about to become their personal credit card.
<p>
  A group of counselors
reviewed my file and decided that I needed IOP (intensive outpatient
therapy) which amounts to 4 times a week, three hours per night.  By this
time, I had been without alcohol for four months and pills three.  I had
managed to maintain my job and start rebuilding my reputation.  They gave me
a chance to appeal this by pleading my case to a group of counselors that I
had never met before.  I thought that if I spoke logically and honestly to
these people that they would understand that putting that kind of regime on
someone without a license and a stressful job is a setup for failure.   I
got about ten minutes where the only questions that were asked related to my
former medications.  I've been evaluated for most everything at one time or
another and had a pill for everyone of them.

<p>
Needless to say they rejected my pleas. I get that, really.  I am sure that
people lie to them all the time and my sobriety is fairly new.   What I
didn't get was being told that I was rejected because in their opinion I
needed to be on medication despite the fact that I had explained in full
detail to the other counselor in detail that the pills were the catalyst for
downhill slide.  I used alcohol when I did not have pills, later I used
both.  I did not doctor shop or do anything illegal to get them so when I
was out, I was out until I saw the doctor next.  I could not believe that
they would be so irresponsible and ignorant.  I have no doubt that if I was
still taking the pills, I would probably still be drinking.  The pills
deadened my conscious which kept me from viewing myself or my life  with any
kind of clarity which made it easier for me to drink.  Yet they pushed me to
see a doctor.  Thankfully he was pleased with my progress and decided that I
was doing well without medication.  In fact, he seemed a little annoyed that
people would make that kind of judgment without knowledge of my medical
history.

<p>
I was also told that focusing on my work was a sure danger sign and they
made the assumption that I was only switching my addictions.  No one asked
how many hours I was really working.  I was also told that dealing with my
anxiety on the weekends through prayer and self counseling was a bad coping
skill.  I now know that if I had told them that I had gotten sober by
filling my time with meetings and handled my anxiety by calling a sponsor
they would have probably let me in the once a week treatment.   But I did
not want to lie anymore.  Addiction and dishonesty go hand in hand.  But in
order to get through this eight to ten week thing, I have to lie.  My length
of time in this thing is dependent on the counselors opinion of my progress
despite the fact none of these counselors appear to be qualified to make
that call.  One of them is a master social worker and the other some kind of
pastoral care person.

<p>
They strictly use AA doctrine despite its religious overtones and the fact
that their funds came from government organizations.  I am a spiritual
person and know that I could not have made it through this without my faith,
but I am offended at having their version of spirituality shoved down my
throat with my tax money. Of course they also charge for these services,
around a hundred dollars a day.   That's a lot of money to me and I have
insurance and a job.  Ninety percent of the people in my group have neither.
They graciously allow you to make payment arrangements something they bring
up every session.  You get kicked out for not paying, sober or not.  It
seems reprehensible to me to appear to want to help addicts while knowing
that your paycheck depends on them staying addicts.

<p>
According to them, AA is the only way to stop.  (Since when is there only
one way to do anything?) They say that the statistics prove what they claim.
What statistics? All they know about are the people that come to meetings.
Considering what I have seen, it is no surprise that recovery rate is very
low and requires numerous times to take if it ever does.  If you don't buy
the AA thing and you're told that is all that works, what is the point of
even trying? Addiction defies logic but attributing it to disease and
allergies while touting personal responsible makes absolutely no sense.
Telling someone that the only way they will remain permanently sober is
attending depressing, drama filled meetings for the rest of their life can
drive you headfirst into the bottle or drug of choice.  The meetings seem to
be their own type of addiction.  It astonishes me that an organization
created by the likes of Bill Wilson would even bring up his name without a
disclaimer.  He might have been sober upon the creation of AA, but it seems
to me that he drowned himself and everyone around him with his narcissism
for the rest of his life.  I cannot respect an organization founded on the
belief system of a lying philanderer and possible crook.

<p>
That being said, why is it the preferred method of treatment? The abysmal
failure rate should be a sign to somebody.  Certainly there are parts of it
that are valuable but AA teaches that it is an all or nothing thing.
You're in denial and on the road to relapse if you question anything. The
only reason I can think that these programs survive and thrive as they do is
financial.  Entire sectors of the population are dependent on the inevitable
failure of people caught in the noose of addiction.  It is a pretty safe bet
that such professionals will always be employable.  Everyone that I know who
successfully put addiction behind them, did it without &quot;working the
program&quot;.   My way of quitting didn't benefit anyone or anything
financially.   Only time will tell if my way works, it is too early to tell.
(153 days is not that long but I never looked at it that way until they
forced me to count) I just do not understand why most people consider AA the
only way.  I am sure it works for some people.  I just don't know any of
them.

Hello Elizabeth,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties that you
are going through.
<p>
Your story reveals precisely what I am so opposed to. Some arrogant
fools shove their 12-Step cult religion and quackery on sick people,
 and victimize them and financially exploit them,
 while pretending that they are &quot;helping&quot; those people.

<p>
That has to stop. I don't know what it's going to take, but that has to stop.

<p>
And why do they claim that A.A. is the only way? Because A.A. is a cult, and
that is what cults do. That is a standard item in the Cult Test:
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="newwin313">11. Insistence that the cult is THE ONLY WAY.</a>

<p>
And here is the answer for A.A.:
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="newwin314">11. Insistence that the cult is THE ONLY WAY.</a>

<p>
You are quite right about &quot;What statistics?&quot;
They don't have anything but faked success statistics. They never do
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">proper clinical tests of their methods</a>
to see if their quackery really works.
(Why should they? They have weasled their way into positions of authority, and
now they always get your money, without even having a working treatment.)

<p>
The rest of your letter doesn't need any comment, really. You have
done a good job of describing the corrupt &quot;treatment&quot; racket.
All that I could do is just repeat what you have said.

<p>
You have the right plan &#8212; in the short term, you have to just put up with the
routine, and just get through it.
<p>
But in the long run, we need more publicity to bring this dishonest racket to the
attention of the public and the powers that be.

<p>
Hi Agent O

<p>
Nice to get your reply today.  That &quot;I AM&quot; quote from Steven G (in case he should
wish to protect his anonymity) was exactly on the money. That's just what I was
getting at. Excellent &#8212; I'm filing it for future ref.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Diana,
<p>
Thanks for the response. That is some interesting stuff.
<p>
No need to keep Steven Gaskin's name anonymous. He was famous for a while.
He was a professor at San Francisco State University who took psychedelics
back in the 'sixties, and learned a few things, and started giving free
lectures on life, the Universe, and everything.
Many of them are contained in his book <i>&quot;Monday Night Class&quot;</i>.
He ended up attracting a huge following, and he came to the conclusion that they needed to
get out of the city, so they got a large number of old school buses and drove across the
country in a caravan, looking for a good place to live. Like modern-day gypsies.
<p>
I met them in Boulder, Colorado, and almost joined them, but forgot to go to the free lecture
that I was invited to, so I missed the bus. So it goes. My kharma was to go to a commune in
northern New Mexico, up in the mountains, surrounded by forest, and spend years there.
<p>
They bought land in Sommerville, Tennessee, and had a farm there for many years.
They also got involved with charity work, like going to Guatemala and building houses for
the earthquake victims there. Gaskin had this wonderful enlightened attitude like,
<font color="green">
&quot;So we can take care of ourselves and be self-supporting? That's nothing. The question is,
'How many other people can you take care of?'&quot;
</font>
<br>
So they got into helping others.

<p>
They were the single most successful hippie commune for many years.
I heard a rumor that the farm eventually broke up. I don't know. That's another thing to look up
on the Internet.
<p>
They also set up a publishing house, and published many books.
Search the Internet for &quot;Steven Gaskin&quot;
or &quot;The Farm&quot;, or &quot;Sommerville, TN&quot;.

</font>
<p>
Thanks for setting me straight on the sexual exploitation angle.  I wasn't disputing
it, as you seem to have graciously understood, but just that it was (thankfully) not
part of my experience.  I didn't realize there was as much evidence of it as there
undoubtedly is and so I withdraw my criticism of that as being a weak angle.  It was
me who was under-informed, which I always like to admit (on those rare
occasions...:-)

<p>
I AM (tee hee) however, familiar with the famous Clancy of the Pacific Group!  I was
blissfully unaware of this scandal, but I have zero problem accepting it as the
truth.  Indeed, I found it strange, even as a starry-eyed newcomer, grateful not to
be dead and thinking AA had something to do with it (actually it was the medical
staff at Beth Israel Centre in NYC and a stranger I only know as &quot;Jack&quot; who have the
distinction of saving my life), I found it strange as I was saying, that in a cult
of anonymity that certain personalities seemed to achieve such renown.  As it turns
out they also achieved infamy.

<p>
Because I went to meetings more on the East side, Hollywood and beyond, I only
attended one meeting of the Pacific Group out in the Pallisades.  It was memorable,
the location, the setting, the number of old timers, the sheer numbers of people (it
was an ENORMOUS meeting) definitely all contributed to a vibe that I guess is what
evangelists get at their tent meetings or whatever.  Yeah, those guys were set to be
holly rollers for sure!

<p>
The predatorial sexual behaviour described is as you point out, classic cult leader
&quot;trust in me and be healed and let me twiddle your bits while I'm at it&quot; shit.
Really standard.  I guess I was lucky because I was always a part of the
gay-friendly scene and so less hetero predatorial males are going to be around that
in the first place!

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you were right there, in Clancy's den, and slipped away with mind and body intact.
What a small world it is.

</font>
<p>
Regarding the ayahuasca/iboga.  Yes funnily, aya was one of the only things I'd
never done and it's what took me out of AA as I hinted at before.  The iboga scares
me too much, though I'm fascinated.  Interestingly, I keep getting invitations to do
it in a safe intentional situation and it is without fail on a weekend when I'm out
of the country.  And I am not going in and out of the country constantly so I take
that as an &quot;omen&quot; if you will.  If it's meant for me, not to be superstitious, it
will be natural and right, the way the aya came in.  I'd read all these books about
shamanism as a teenager and was very interested in it but it never even occurred to
me to try and find it and then one day it came and found me.

<p>
If you ever do decide to give it a try I think you can feel pretty assured that no
brain cell frying will take place.  It's a really powerful entheogen which gives you
intense personal insights (not to mention pretty colours).  It works on the addict
by taking them through a trip in which they face their inner demons.  The iboga is
even more specific and contains certain compounds that not only takes an addict
(even a hard core junkie) through the physical withdrawal way faster and without the
usual symptoms but also kind of programs a revulsion button in the subject's very
being.  Kind of like the aversion therapy in Clockwork Orange, only the movie is in
your head I guess.  It doesn't work for everyone &#8212; what does &#8212; but I've heard
staggering results.  People who've used every day for 30 years just walk away from
it and never look back.

<p>
It's a trip, as the saying goes.

<p>
In the end though, despite the legal usefulness of the Religious Freedom Act to
combat the Controlled Substances Act, I am now personally doubtful regarding the
wisdom of allowing these privileges to be tied up with religion.  To me, it just
compounds the problem further.  Yuu have to &quot;Sing up with another corporation&quot; as a
friend puts it, in order to get high.  Fuck off. I ought to be allowed to take a
safe dose of peyote with friends in my living room and not be breaking a law.  Why
should I have to be in a Native American sweat lodge?

<p>
<font color="blue">
The ayahuasca and ibogaine certainly sound interesting. I've heard of those kinds of dramatic
instant results before. Some researchers were getting alcoholics sobered up with LSD therapy
back in the 'sixties. We were just discussing that,
<a href="orange-letters167.html#LSD" target="newwin388">here</a>.
<p>
 Personally, I do believe that my tripping
days are over. Been there, done that. It was really great for a while. But in the end, when I would
take LSD, all that it would say was, &quot;Quit smoking, quit taking LSD, and get your life together.&quot;
And that was that. And the next time I took LSD, I got the same message.
After about three times of that, I stopped taking LSD.
It took a lot more years to finally get off of the tobacco addiction.
<p>
So now my big project is developing continuous consciousness without any chemical stimulation
(other than good strong kick-ass coffee, which I'm drinking right now).
</font>
<p>
I broke away from the Daime because religion, no matter how fucking groovy (and what
gets groovier than getting super high on psychedelics and singing and playing music
all night in an atmosphere of total joy and love) is just not for this chicken.

<p>
Anyway, it's kind of interesting that one cult saved me from another, but in the end
it was refusing to let go of my intellect that saved me from both.

<p>
The intellect is often posited as the enemy of what is good, in these
hyper-emotional times, but while I love an indescribable feeling as much as the next
person, I am IN love with what it feels like when I really understand something.
Blind faith doesn't give me that feeling.  I guess I prefer mystery to belief.

<p>
Yes, refusing to let go of my intellect is what saved me from a few cults too. Funny how just about
every cult I ever got involved with wanted me to stop thinking and stop asking critical questions,
and just believe stupid things.

<p>
In fact, I remember when I was going to like my third A.A. meeting ever, about 21 years ago,
and asked one of the old-timers what to do and how the program really worked, and he gave me
this mindless grin and shrugged his shoulders, and just said, &quot;Keep coming back.&quot;
I found that a less than satisfactory answer.
<p>
So I just drifted away from A.A. I decided that they were nice people, but I didn't want to
spend the rest of my life sitting around talking about drinking.
In those years, I only went to four A.A. meetings, ever, all
totalled, but still kept myself sober for three years.

<p>
It would be many more years before I learned
<a href="orange-intro.html#intellectual" target="newwin339">just how intensely anti-intellectual</a>
A.A. really is.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

I just completed reading your theory and paper on AA, Bill Wilson, and all
of the 12-Steps and have to say this: You are a complete and utter jack-ass
my friend. You obviously need attention and require help.  This program has
worked for millions of people and continues to work miracles today.

<p>
You and your organization should be ashamed of yourself for posting such
complete nonsense.  May God have mercy on your poor and lost soul.

Hello Brent,
<p>
Well, you are repeating the regular cult slogans.
<p>
First off, &quot;the program&quot; does not work &quot;for millions&quot;.
I've already answered that false A.A. claim so many times that I will just point you to the facts,
<a href="orange-secrets.html#not_work" target="newwwin14">here</a>.
You can also read about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="newwin15">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment,
here</a>.

<p>
Then, about,
<font color="black">
&quot;being ashamed for posting such nonsense&quot;</font>, no, I am not ashamed of telling the truth.
The A.A. claim that you are hurting alcoholics by telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous
is just another standard cultish dodge to avoid having people hearing the real facts of
the matter.

Subject:  	I Almost Drank the Kool-Aid<br>

Dear Orange,

<p>
You and your website are awesome!  I started OA at the end of last October.  I quit
a few weeks ago.  I could never get with the program.  Something seemed off, not
right.  I couldn't pinpoint it.  I thought something was wrong with me.  I would
read the part about &quot;rarely has anyone failed...&quot; and think I'm not totally
surrendering.  I am weak, a failure.  I resisted a lot and questioned everything.  I
tried...I really did.  I told my sponsor I thought OA was very negative.  It's like
OA is boot camp and tears/strips/knocks you completely down...to nothing...then
builds you back up.  I couldn't get past the fact that my overeating was an
addiction, sickness, illness, and that I would never be cured.  I couldn't accept
abstinence forever.  And I couldn't get past all of the character defects and flaws
that needed to be removed.  I knew I had a problem before but when I got to OA I
found out how screwed up I really was.  I completed steps 1-3.  I was typing up the
questions for step 4 and something just snapped inside of me.  Like you say, the
moral inventory only focuses on the negative...what about the positive?  You've
gotta take the good with the bad.  I decided that the questions on the moral
inventory had nothing to do with me losing weight.  What part did I have to do with
my resentments and anger...maybe I was a child and didn't know any different or
better or how to defend myself.  Everything is YOUR fault.  I decided that God
doesn't require me to do a moral inventory so why am I doing this?  And He doesn't
require me to remove my defects.  This is BS.  I started googling to find out if 12
step programs are a hoax.  I found your website...a Godsend.  I e-mailed my sponsor
and said I'm done.  AA doesn't have any medical backing and I had no idea about all
of the contradictions and inconsistencies.  I haven't read everything in your
website...I like everything I've seen.  I think you've done a lot of research and
have the experience to back it.  It's not just fluff.  I think you know exactly what
you're talking about.  I see a lot of people criticize you, but you're right on.  It
IS brainwashing.  You become a slave to the program.  I have come to the conclusion
that 12-step programs are not for me.  If you think they're for you then knock
yourself out.  Orange, thank you for your website, knowledge, and expertise.  You
are well versed and a very articulate writer.  I think you're a 12-step genius and
that you're brilliant.

<p>
Take care.  I think I saw in your latest letter that you've found a new home.  Hope
you're enjoying your new digs.  Keep up the good work and thank you for helping me
see the light.

Hi Mary,
<p>
Thank you for a bright, positive letter. That goes well with the morning cup of coffee.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you escaped from the madhouse. So have a good day and a good life now.
