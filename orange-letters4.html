[ Pamela's second letter: ]
<p>

WELL I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN AA FOR 13 YEARS AND I WAS THROUGH TREATMENT
AND COUNSELING OVER THE YEARS AND AT NO TIME HAVE I EVER EXPERIENCES
WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR INTRO.
<p><font color="blue">
</font><p>

<p>
I AM NOT A DIE HARD, AND PROBABLY WOULD OF LEFT IF THE AA PEOPLE CAME
ONTO ME LIKE YOU DESCRIBE, BUT THEY NEVER AT 100'S OF MEETINGS I'VE
ATTENDED ALL OVER WISCONSIN HAVE THEY EVER DISPLAYED WHAT YOU DESCRIBED
AS &quot;CULTISH BEHAVIORS&quot;.
NEITHER DID THE TREATMENT CENTERS OR COUNSELORS I'VE BEEN TO.
<p>
<p><font color="blue">
As Carl Sagan liked to say, &quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;
Just because you were lucky to not see the bad side of Alcoholics Anonymous
doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
<p>
I get lots of reports of bad stuff. Alas, some of the most dramatic stuff reads like,<br>
<font color="green">
&quot;This is the program I'm in, and these are the horrible things that are going
on. But please don't print this letter or I'll get in big trouble.&quot;<br>
</font>
That leaves me in the position where I know more than I'm telling. I really wish
I could print those letters, but I can't.

<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
Besides, <a href="#cultish_behavior" target="_blank">further down</a> in this letter
you change your mind and start describing such cultish behavior in
your own A.A. group.
</font>
</font><p>

<a name="cause1"> </a>
I HAVE NEVER PICKED UP A DRINK SINCE 4-19-89 13 YEARS NOW, AND I OWE IT
TO THE WONDERFUL LOVING PEOPLE IN AA.  ANOTHER POINT IT HAS SAVED MY
MARRIAGE, AND TWO OF MY BROTHER'S AND THERE FAMILIES.

<p><font color="blue">
Congratulations on your sober time. You did it. Nobody else did it for you.
Nobody but you holds your hand every Saturday night.
You don't owe your sobriety to anyone else or anything else but you.
<p>
You are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">
confusing cause and effect with coincidence or correlation</a>.
A.A. did not make you stop drinking any more than the rooster's crowing makes the
sun rise. Why didn't you just tell the A.A. members to drop dead, go away, and
quit interfering in your life, like so many other people do? Because you were
sick and tired of being sick and tired, and wanted to quit. So you did quit.
You get the credit for that, not A.A..

<p>
This is a common problem. People imagine that if they did some of the Twelve Steps,
and then they quit drinking, that the Twelve Steps made them quit drinking.
It's also called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc" target="_blank"><i>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc</i></a>.
Meaning:
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>It happened after 'something', so it must have been caused by that 'something'.</i>
</font>
Not valid logic at all.
<p>
Now I'm sure that you are quite convinced that somehow either the 12 steps
or A.A. meetings or the Big Book or something <i>&quot;made&quot;</i> you quit drinking,
but they didn't. All of the fair and unbiased tests of A.A. have shown it be be completely
ineffective. It has a zero percent success rate. Even one of the members of the Board of
Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Professor George Vaillant</a> of
Harvard University, discovered that when he tried to show that A.A. treatment of alcoholics
works. Instead,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">he found that A.A. kills</a>.
He came up with a zero percent success rate for A.A.,
coupled with the highest death rate of any of the programs that he examined.
<p>
Read
<a href="orange-letters3.html#Brian" target="_blank">my answer to Brian</a>, another A.A. old-timer,
for more on this subject.

<p>
NOTHING IS PUSHED, NO ONE IS KICKED OUT, NO WEIRD VOODOO IS GOING ON.
AND DEFIANTLY NO SPECIFIC RELIGION IS PUSHED, YOU CHOSE YOUR OWN
CONCEPT OF GOD.
<p><font color="blue">
You choose your own concept of God, and then your sponsor corrects it and tells you
what you should really believe. It just is not possible to <i>Work The Steps</i> unless
you believe in a willful micro-managing, order-dictating, wish-granting, prayer-answering,
defect-removing,
message-transmitting, authoritarian God. Check out
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">The Bait And Switch Con Game</a>.
</font><p>



YOU CHOSE YOUR OWN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T DO A
GOOD JOB MANAGING OUR OWN LIVES WITH THE "BEAST THOUGHTS" YOU TALKED
ABOUT, SO WE TURN IT OVER TO SOMETHING THAT HAS OUR BEST INTEREST AT
HAND.  A PROGRAM TO HELP US LIVE VS DIE FROM OUR OBSESSION TO CONTINUE
TO DRINK AND SELF-DESTRUCT.
<p><font color="blue">
Just because you royally screwed up once, and made some mistakes, doesn't
mean that you can't learn to do it right.
<p>
And the ridiculous A.A. theology says that you can use anything as your Higher Power,
even a bed pan. Since when does a bed pan have your best interests at heart? Notice
the conflict that statement creates. A.A. loves to brag about all of the atheists
it has, and how A.A. offers complete religious freedom. But if we accept your
statement about &quot;turning it over to Something that has our best interests
at heart&quot; then we lose our freedom of religion. We must have a Higher Power
who has our best interests at heart (and will do something about it).
Thus we get nudged towards belief in the official A.A. version of God.
That's an example of the
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">A.A. <i>Religious Freedom to
Religious Conformity</i></a> bait-and-switch strategy.
<p>

The idea that you have to &quot;turn it over&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#surrender2" target="_blank">surrender</a>&quot; is defeatist.
Besides,<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">
When did God say that it was okay for you to turn your will and your
life over to Him?</a><br>
<li>
When did God say that He would be happy with you being a quitter, and
surrendering and giving up on yourself?<br>
<li>
When did God say that He would fix everything for you, while you
do nothing but passively wait for him to remove your
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character&quot;
in Step Seven?
<li>
<a href="orange-heresy.html#narcissistic" target="_blank">
When did God say that He <i>*really would*</i> take care of you if you regressed to
being a helpless (&quot;powerless&quot;) baby?</a><br>
</ul>
</font><p>

<p>
OF COURSE IT IS A &quot;PROGRAM&quot; WITH STEPS AND IDEAS OF HOW TO STAY
SOBER. IT IS ONE OF MANY, BUT ONE OF THE MAIN ONE'S THAT WORKS FOR
MANY.  WHERE YOU GET YOUR SUCCESS RATE FROM AA IS ABSURD.
<p><font color="blue">
Like it or not, I get the A.A. failure rate from
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">the A.A. G.S.O.</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Professor George Vaillant</a>,
who is one of the members of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc..
<li> And I also get it from
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific" target="_blank">every
other good test of A.A. ever done</a>.
</ol>
They all say the same thing: A.A. doesn't really
work. It is a hoax, a fraud, just another cult religion with
quack medicine, not much different from Scientology &#8212; just more popular.

</font><p>

<p><font color="blue">
</font><p>

THE ODDS OF
RECOVERY IN ANY PROGRAM OUR BAD BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE
&quot;BEAST/ADDICTION&quot;.  OF COURSE WHEN YOU GO TO AN AA MEETING THAT'S WHAT
THEY DO THERE WORK THE PROGRAM OF AA, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT LEAVE.
<p><font color="blue">
I can leave, but the people who get sentenced to A.A. by a court or
parole officer cannot.
</font><p>


IT DOES NOT GO WITHOUT SAYING THERE MIGHT BE SOME SICK GROUPS OUT THERE
DOING CULTISH THINGS THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO, THEN REPORT IT
TO NEW YORK AA OFFICES THEY WILL SEND SOMEONE TO MONITOR IT AND DISBAND
IT IF IT IS USING THE AA PROGRAM INCORRECTLY.
<p><font color="blue">
The A.A. police are powerless over A.A.'s &quot;loving therapists and counselors&quot;, aren't they?
A.A. can't fire them for malpractice, because A.A. isn't their employer.
All that A.A. can do is delist the most obnoxious of groups, isn't it?
Besides, the things I described in the introduction are standard
A.A. dogma, like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are not really sober; you are <i>only abstaining</i>,
if you aren't going to meetings and doing the 12 steps.&quot;
</font>
Nobody is going to get kicked out of A.A. for pushing stuff like that.
</font><p>


COUNSELORS THAT SHOVE
THINGS DOWN PATIENTS THROUGHTS IS THAT COUNSELORS BELIEF NOT A AGENT OF
AA IN DISGUISE.  IT'S THAT COUNSELORS WAKO IDEAS AND CONTROL ISSUES TO
FORCE HIS PATIENT TO DO AS HE THINKS IS BEST.  HE DOES NOT REPRESENT AA
EVEN THOUGH HE PUSHES &quot;THEIR VIEW&quot;.
<p><font color="blue">
No, they are not agents of A.A. in disguise. They are agents of A.A. and N.A.
in plain sight. They don't hide their membership in, or love of,
12-step organizations. They openly declare that they are recovering in A.A.
or N.A., and going to meetings all of the time, and declare that you must, too.
</font><p>


AA GETS REPRESENTED UNFORTUNATELY
BY A LOT OF WAKO PEOPLE, BUT TO JUDGE A GOOD GOAL WHICH AA HAS, TO
OFFER ONE WAY OF ALCOHOLICS TO ACHIEVE SOBRIETY, WHAT BAD CAN COME OF
THAT TO HELP PEOPLE LIVE.
<p><font color="blue">
Unfortunately, all kinds of bad things can come from it. The road to Hell is paved with
good intentions. A.A. kills. Read on.
</font><p>

<p>
THE TWELVE STEPS HELP THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK THROUGH ISSUES
SUCH AS YOU DID.
<p><font color="blue">
The Twelve Steps are
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">
a formula for building a cult religion</a>, period.
</font><p>

<p><font color="blue">
</font><p>



SOME ARE FROM LOWER LIFE STYLES WHO HAVE NO CLUE, AND
NEED HELP WITH STEP BY STEP WORKING THROUGH SOME PRETTY HAUNTING
EXPERIENCES AND GUILT IN THEIR LIVES.  BY WORKING THE STEPS WHICH IS IN
SIMPLISTIC EASE FORM HELPS MANY PEOPLE BE FREE FROM PAIN AND PAST
HAUNTINGS.  AS WELL AS SHAME, GUILT, REMORSE OF WHAT WE DID, WHICH BY
THE WAY IS ONE OF THE REASON'S AN ALCOHOLIC CONTINUES TO ABUSE
THEMSELVES WITH ALCOHOL BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT AT THE
BOTTOM OF SOMEONE'S SHOE.
<p><font color="blue">
The Twelve Steps cause
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#moral_inventory" target="_blank">more guilt</a>, not less.
</font><p>

AA HAS THE MOST UNCONDITIONALLY LOVING HUMAN
BEINGS I'VE EVER FOUND.
<p><font color="blue">
The &quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#unconditional_love" target="_blank">unconditional love</a>&quot;
concept is itself another cult trap.
It means that you cannot feel your own feelings &#8212; you must always just smile
and pretend that you love everybody else.
The slogan is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't take somebody else's inventory.&quot;</font>
See
<a href="orange-heresy.html#ftnt01_ret" target="_blank">what Kramer and Alstad had to say about it</a>.
</font><p>



CALL DAY NIGHT, RICH OR POOR, MONEY NO MONEY,
UGLY OR PRETTY, DOESN'T MATTER THEY WANT TO HELP FREE OF CHARGE NO
CATCH EXCEPT THE WONDERFUL GOOD FEELING OF PURPOSE AND USEFULNESS IN
LIFE.  PLUS THE NEW COMER REMINDS THEM OF WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO
BACK TO AND IT HELPS THEM STAY SOBER SEEING A NEW COMER'S PAIN 1ST
COMING INTO A MEETING.
<p><font color="blue">
Yes, some of the people in A.A. are compassionate and well-meaning.
But that does not mean that the over-all effect of the organization is
good.
</font><p>

<p>
THE PROGRAM IS SPIRITUAL IT DOESN'T LIE ABOUT THAT, BUT IT CERTAINLY
NEVER SAY &quot;YOU MUST BELIEVE THIS OR ELSE YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE!&quot;
THAT'S ABSURD.
<p><font color="blue">
Absurd? Then why did Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">brag about doing it</a>?
In his second book,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, Bill wrote the story of Ed the atheist, whom
Bill and the other A.A. elders drove out of A.A. for refusing to believe
in God as Bill dictated.
And more to the point now, Bill then said that the proper strategy to follow now was to
keep the unbelievers in A.A., and convert them into believers.
<p>
Bill Wilson most assuredly insisted that we had to
believe all kinds of things. Just read chapter 4 of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">We Agnostics</a>&quot;</i>
for a non-stop rave about how we all have to discard &quot;Reason&quot;
and human intelligence, and just &quot;have faith&quot; in Bill's favorite delusions.
<p>
The claim that you don't have to believe anything is a bait-and-switch
stunt &#8212;
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">first you don't have to believe, and then you do</a>.
First, A.A. tells you that
&quot;A.A. requires no beliefs,&quot; but
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">then you have to believe
everything they tell you</a>, and have blind faith in the proclamations
of Bill Wilson:
<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I was beginning to see that I would require implicit faith, like
a small child, if I was going to get anywhere.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, <i>The News Hawk</i>, Page 259.</font>
</blockquote>

</font><p>

THE MEETINGS AND COUNSELORS YOU WERE EXPOSED TO ARE A
SMALL FEW WHO HAVE WACKED OUT A GOOD PURPOSE INTO THEIR OWN AGENDA'S.
ALL GROUPS OF POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, OR ANY OTHER LARGE GROUPS ALWAYS
HAVE A HANDFUL OF WACKO'S.  TO JUDGE THE WHOLE THING IS NOT FAIR.
<p><font color="blue">
One of the problems with A.A. is that any group can do anything. Nobody is in
control. We have to judge the whole, because it is the whole that is promoting the
whole thing, including the wackos.
<p>
You can't hide behind the excuse that you aren't responsible for what other groups
do. That's the standard A.A. blame game:<br>
1.) We won't accept any blame for what other groups do.
We have no control over them. It isn't our fault.<br>
2.) We will take credit for all of the good things that other groups do. Aren't we
wonderful? Isn't A.A. wonderful?

</font><p>

<p>
BILL WILSON WAS A SPIRITUAL PERSON WHO'S EXPERIENCES AND BELIEF'S I'VE
COME TO BE SHOWN IN MY OWN LIFE NOT BY AA, BUT BY GOD WHOM IS MY HIGHER
POWER.  SO IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD YOUR EXPERIENCE WON'T HAVE THE
SAME EFFECT AS BILL'S, BUT TO SAY HE IS WRONG FOR WHAT HE EXPERIENCED
AS WELL AS MANY 100'S OF 1,000'S OF PEOPLE SINCE HIM, IS WRONG ON YOUR
PART.  WE ALL FIND OUR WAY DIFFERENTLY.  BILL HAPPENED TO HAVE ONE
WAY.
<p><font color="blue">
Bill Wilson was a con artist, a thief, a liar, a fraud, and a phony holy man,
not a spiritual person. He took, not gave. After he got done robbing A.A., he never
had to work again.
Read about how
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">he stole the Big Book</a> and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">the Big Book publishing fund</a> and set himself up
with a lifetime income.<br>
<p>
Bill's &quot;spiritual&quot; cure for alcoholism was a hoax.
All he did was
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
repackage Frank Buchman's cult religion to create Alcoholics
Anonymous</a>.
Bill knew that he was
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
faking the numbers and cooking the books</a> when he bragged about how
successful his &quot;spiritual method&quot; for treating alcoholism was.
</font><p>



DON'T BASH SOMETHING THAT'S FREE AND HARMLESS.
<p><font color="blue">
It is not harmless. A.A. kills. Professor Vaillant proved that.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank">So did several other researchers</a>.
<p>
A.A. is also not free. Oh, yes, the open meetings are. But it isn't free when they
charge your health insurance plan for at least $1500 for
&quot;alcoholism treatment&quot; while they
indoctrinate you with the 12-step religion.
<p>
And did you know that 12-step &quot;treatment&quot; centers like
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">Hazelden</a> and The Betty Ford Clinic charge prices
like $15,000 for a 28-day stay which emphasizes indoctrination in the 12 steps?
That isn't free at all. That's a bloody fortune.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: 2014.12.16: The prices have gone up to $30,000 to $40,000 for 28 days in celebrity rehabs.
</font>
</font><p>



YOU CAN JOIN OR
NOT, YOU DON'T OWE MONEY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, LEADERS CHANGE AND THEIR
GOAL IS SERVICE TO GIVE BACK WHAT THEY SO FREELY RECEIVED FROM THE
OTHER LOVING PEOPLE OF AA.  GIVING IS BAD?  I WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO
THE PEOPLE OF AA WHO STAYED UP WITH ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
TALKING TO ME WHEN I WANTED TO DRINK.  TRYING TO TALK ME OUT OF
KILLING MYSELF.  ALL FOR FREE AND TO HELP THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT GIVING
AND STAY SOBER BECAUSE THEY NEVER WANTED TO FEEL THE WAY I FELT AGAIN.
WHAT'S THE "CULTY" CATCH?
<p><font color="blue">
I have always said that having some friends who give you moral support
and encouragement can be very good. But real friends do not then turn around
and try to convert you to their cult religion.
</font>
<p>
<a name="cultish_behavior">
I WAS EXPOSED TO ONE GROUP THAT THE REST OF US HEARD WAS CULTISH.  ONE
GUY WHO WAS VERY CHARISMATIC STARTED A GROUP AND HE WAS VERY
INTIMIDATING AND PREYED ON PEOPLE WHO WERE LONERS OR PEOPLE WHO WANTED
TO FIT IN TO CLICKS OR BE POPULAR BUT NEVER WAS.  HE TOOK TERRIBLE
ADVANTAGE OF THEM.  4TH STEPS WERE SHAMEFUL, AND THEY WERE TREATED LIKE
ARMY RECRUITS ETC.  NOW I COULD HAVE TURNED FROM AA, BUT THAT WAS NOT
AA, THAT WAS ONE WACKO CONTROL FREAK HARMING MANY GOOD PEOPLE.  THEY
WERE SHUT DOWN.
<p><font color="blue">
What did you just say? They were shut down? How?<br>
<ul>
<li> What happened to &quot;every group is independent&quot;?
How do the A.A. police stop people from meeting?
<li> Who is the big boss who dictates which groups will be shut down?
<li> How does he decide who will get shut down? What are the standards? What
are the rules, and where are they published?
<li> How do they enforce the shutdown?
<li> What happened to the rap about how you are not responsible for
what other groups do, and can't take any blame for what they do,
because you have no control over them?
<li> Now you tell me that you do have control over them, and can shut them
down if you don't like what they are doing?
</ul>
<p>
And actually, that reprehensible behavior was most assuredly also a part of A.A..
You can't just declare that everything that you don't like
is &quot;not A.A.&quot;. If it is done in A.A. meetings by A.A. members, then
it is A.A.. If it is done by an A.A. sponsor to a sponsee, then that is A.A..
And by your own admission, you stated that he hurt many good people, he took
terrible advantage of them, and the Fourth Steps were shameful. But throughout
the rest of your letters you deny that A.A. has hurt anybody.
That is just plain wrong.
<p>
Besides,
<a href="#no_abuses" target="_blank" target="_blank">you started this letter</a> by saying that you had never, in your
13 years in A.A., ever seen any such misbehavior or abuse like I had described
in <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction</a>.
Now you are describing worse abuses and misbehavior yourself.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
You are even saying that it happened in <i>your own</i> group.
</font>
<p>
</font><p>

OPEN YOUR MIND UP WOULD YOU.  STOP BEING PARANOID AND
SUPERSTITIOUS.
<p><font color="blue">
You had better look in the mirror. It isn't me who is trying to sell superstition,
&quot;spirituality&quot;, and faith healing.
</font><p>




SO YOU HAD SEVERAL BAD EXPERIENCES I AM SORRY FOR THAT,
BUT GESH THE WEIRD EXTREME COMMENTS ARE SO DISTORTED AND UNTRUE IT'S
BORDER LINING ON SICK YOURSELF.  PARANOID SKIZO OR SOMETHING.  I'M
SORRY, BUT MY BROTHER IS PARANOID SKIZO AND HE HAS VERY WAY OUT IDEAS.
HE'S NOT CAPABLE OF SEEING PEOPLE ON A SMALL LEVEL CAN RUIN A LARGE
GROUP BY MISREPRESENTING THE LARGE GROUP.  HE JUST TAKES IT AS "ALL AA"
IS A CULT.
<p><font color="blue">
So are you telling me that your own brother criticizes you for being a cult member?
</font><p>


THAT IS TO GENERALIZING TO ASSUME SUCH A SIMPLISTIC IDEA.
ALL WHITES ARE PREJUDICE, ALL BLACKS ARE POOR, WHAT!  TO GENERAL, AND
NOT TRUE!  WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR FACTS, SOME OTHER WACKO PERSON.  YOU
SHOULD BASE YOUR RESEARCH ON A COUPLE 100 PEOPLE QUESTIONNAIRE VS A
SMALL GROUP OR OTHER WACKO'S WITH YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES SIDING TOGETHER
AND JUDGING A TRULY GOOD FUNCTION TO HELP OTHER ALCOHOLICS ACHIEVE
SOBRIETY.
<p><font color="blue">
Where do I get my facts? Well, among other places, from the &quot;wacko&quot; leaders of
Alcoholics Anonymous, like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">the G.S.O.</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Professor Vaillant</a>.
Also from the <i>Big Book</i>. Also from Bill Wilson's
other books like
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">12x12</a> and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i></a>.
And from a lot more books.
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">See the bibliography</a>.
<p>
You sound like you are now recommending some good, fair, scientific testing
of A.A., just like all of the stuff I have described in the web page on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
<i>The Effectiveness of the Twelve Step Treatment</i></a>. The idea is that you
take 200 alcoholics, or 1000 alcoholics, and put half of them in the A.A. program,
and give the other half nothing &#8212; no treatment at all, and then,
after a year or several years,
you compare the two groups, and see how well they did. When that test was done,
the group that received
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_treatment" target="_blank">
<i>no treatment at all</i> did better</a> than the A.A. group.
That has happened repeatedly, in several different tests.

THAT'S THE BAD AND CULT YOU THINK THEY ARE?  HELPING OTHERS
BY NOT THINKING OF OURSELVES IS NOT WRONG.  WHEN WE DRANK WE HURT A LOT
OF PEOPLE BY OUR SELFISH ACT OF DRINKING AND THE PAIN WE CAUSED OUR
FAMILIES TO WORRY ABOUT US IS UNBELIEVABLE.  THEY DON'T SAY WE SHOULD
FEEL SHAME, ETC. WE ALREADY DO YOU IDIOT!  WE COME THERE TO TALK ABOUT
THE EXISTING SHAME AND GUILT DRINKING CAUSED US AND TO WORK THROUGH
IT.  YOUR MISSING THE WHOLE POINT OF THE AA PROGRAM, YOU DON'T GET IT
AT ALL.
<p><font color="blue">
I do get it. I understand exactly what A.A. is supposed to be.
Unfortunately, that is not what it is.
</font><p>

MY OPINION IS BASED SOULY ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES WITH AA.  I
DON'T VOLUNTEER, NOR AM I A DIE HARD.  I ATTEND MEETINGS ONCE A WEEK
JUST TO MAINTAIN MY POSITIVE OUT LOOK AND TO HELP OTHERS IF THEY NEED A
HELPING HAND.  MANY DON'T HAVE FAMILY OR FRIENDS LEFT, AND MANY ARE SO
FAR FROM A SPIRITUAL PROGRAM AND LOST AND HOPELESS THEY NEED A FRIEND.
IT'S LIKE A BIG BROTHER OR BIG SISTER PROGRAM IN A SENSE.  WE LOVE
PEOPLE WHO HAS NO ONE LEFT OR WHO CAN'T LOVE THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY CAN
LOVE THEMSELVES AND WANT TO LIVE AND NOT KILL THEMSELVES ANYMORE.
"LOVE"  IS FREE AND AA'S BASIS IS TO GIVE AWAY WHAT WE WERE SO FREELY
GIVEN BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED US TILL WE COULD LOVE OURSELVES.  BILL
EXPLAINED SOME PROFOUND EXPERIENCES HE HAD, SOME "LIFE TRUTHS"  THAT
ALTERED HIS THINKING TREMENDOUSLY.  CULT NO, A BLESSING THAT HELPED HIM
STOP DRINKING.  WHO CARES IT HELPED HIM AND WAS FOR THE SOUL GOOD OF
HIM.  ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T HURT US AND IS FOR GOOD IS GOOD.
<p><font color="blue">
Bill Wilson had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">some experiences</a>
all right, but it is questionable just how profound they were.
While Bill was in Towns' Hospital,
sick, detoxing, going through <i>delirium tremens</i> and alcohol withdrawal,
and whacked out on medications,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">
the Oxford Group cult attacked his mind</a>
and converted Bill into one of their own.
Undoubtedly, Bill's &quot;religious experience&quot; and conversion to Buchmanism
were helped by
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">the hallucinogenic drugs like
belladonna</a> that Dr. Silkworth gave Bill.
</font><p>



I HAVE
HAD THE SUDDEN SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE BILL TALKED ABOUT, SOME DO SOME
DON'T.  I WAS SAVED BY MY GOD NOT BY AA.  THIS IS MY PERSONAL BELIEF.
GOD LEAD ME TO AA BECAUSE HE KNEW I'D BE HELP THERE.  MAYBE YOU
WOULDN'T WHO KNOWS, MOVE ON AND STOP TRYING TO MAKE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A
MOLE HILL.  IT'S SO DISTORTED.  IT'S LIKE THE WACKO'S WHO WATCH THESE
CARTOONS MADE FOR KIDS.  THINKING THEY SEE A SEX ORGAN ON A CHARACTER
OR SOMETHING.  LIKE A KID SEES THAT.  IT'S THE ADULTS WARPED SICK MIND
THEY HAVE THAT SEES IT AND HAULERS ABOUT IT THEN THE KIDS SEE IT THEN
IT EFFECTS THE KIDS.  THE KIDS IF NOT POINTED IT OUT BY SOME WACKO THEY
WOULDN'T EVEN OF PAID ATTENTION TO IT.  SO IT WAS A ACCIDENT IN A
DRAWING.  EVEN IF IT WAS INTENTIONAL WHO CARES IN MY HOUSE I WOULDN'T
DRAW ATTENTION TO IT CUZ THAT'S WHAT THE PERSON WOULD WANT YOU TO DO.
THIS WAY IF I DON'T MY KIDS WON'T KNOW AND WON'T BE EFFECTED.  IF OTHER
KIDS SAY THEIR PARENTS TOLD THEM TO LOOK FOR THIS SICK THING ON A
CARTOON THEN I WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO MY KIDS.  IF YOU DRAW ATTENTION
TO IT, IT BECOMES A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST LETTING OTHERS HAVE THEIR
VIEWS.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Are you trying to tell me that everything will be okay if I just don't criticize
Alcoholics Anonymous? The problems will all go away if we don't talk about them?

<p>

I AM NOT AN ACTIVIST.  I JUST HAVE A BROAD MIND AND I AM NOT A

[Letter 3:]
<p>

YOU ARE MISSING SO MANY THINGS.  YOUR MISINTERPRETING SO CLEARLY IT'S RIDICULOUS. 
<p><font color="blue">
</font>
<p>

A.A. DIDN'T SOBER ME UP AND STOP MY DRINKING. NO KINDING! I GOT SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND
TIRED. AA IS A SUPPORT SYSTEM OF LOVING PEOPLE THAT WHEN I GET THE OBSESSION EARLY ON TO DRINK
OR THE TEMPTATION TO DRINK I CAN GO TO A MEETING AND TALK ABOUT IT. THE OBSESSION LESSONS AND I
ALSO HEAR STORIES OF REMINDERS OF HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS OUT THERE. THIS REMINDS ME I DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK THERE AGAIN. IT ALSO GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP A NEW PERSON STAY SOBER
TODAY. HELP NOT DO IT FOR THEM. AA CAN'T IN AN OF ITSELF KEEP ME FROM DRINKING WHO SAID IT
COULD. IT IS THE PERSON WHO TAKES PERSONAL ACTION TO NOT PICK UP THE FIRST DRINK. AA IS A SUPPORT
SYSTEM TO HELP ME DO THAT. MOST &quot;NORMAL PEOPLE&quot; DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO OBSESS
OVER ALCOHOL AND THE WAY IT MAKES US FEEL. IT'S AN ESCAPE AND A STATE OF MIND THAT IS WHERE
THERE IS NOT A FEELING IN THE WORLD OR CARE IN THE WORLD. AA PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AND DON'T
JUDGE ME AS BEING CRAZY AS &quot;NORMAL DRINKERS&quot; DO. THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND AND THEY SHAME
ALCOHOLICS WITHOUT KNOWING. 
<p><font color="blue">
You are displaying a number of the standard cult attitudes:
<ol>
<li> We are different from outsiders (<i>&quot;normies&quot;</i>).
<li> Only another cult member understands.
<li> Outsiders will persecute you &#8212; they will shame you &#8212; so you
can't trust anybody but another cult member.
</ol>
<p>
You are also contradicting a lot of standard A.A. dogma:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;AA CAN'T IN AN OF ITSELF KEEP ME FROM DRINKING WHO SAID IT
COULD.&quot;<br>
</font>
Well, Bill Wilson said so. The Big Book says so. And most of the true believers who
write to me say so. They all insist that &quot;The program works.
It made me quit drinking. It saved my life.&quot;<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>&quot;Keep Coming Back! It Works! (if you work it...)&quot;</i><br>
</font>
They all insist that <i>Working The Steps</i> *made* them quit drinking.
<p>
<a name="Bills_sermons"> </a>
And Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that God will remove the alcoholism
problem from us, just lift it right out of us, if we do his Twelve Steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it. &nbsp; ...<br>
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wilson actually wrote that our alcoholism is removed &quot;without any
thought or effort on our part.&quot; How wonderful. It just doesn't get
any easier than that, does it?
<p>
And no, that isn't a typo, and no, I'm not exaggerating. Bill Wilson
repeated that claim in his next book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So in a very complete and literal way, all A.A.'s have &quot;become
entirely ready&quot; to have God remove the mania for alcohol from
their lives. And God has proceeded to do exactly that.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This does not mean we expect all our character defects to be lifted
out of us as the drive to drink was.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 65.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now you can, of course, have your own beliefs and your own interpretation
of alcoholism. Your attitude that A.A. is merely a support group, and not a cure-all,
sounds far more realistic than the usual A.A. sermons that I get from other emailers.
<p>
But I wasn't writing about your ideas of alcoholism; I was writing about
Bill Wilson's ideas and the standard A.A. dogma, because that's what all of the
other groups are pushing, and that's what gets shoved on the newcomers.
And that's what is being sold in the <i>Big Book</i>.
Also, note that no matter how enlightened your understanding of A.A. or alcoholism may be,
the ridiculous declarations of Bill Wilson in the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i>
will not be changed, updated, or fixed at all. AAWS just released the fourth edition of the
<i>Big Book</i>,
and they didn't fix a single one of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill's delusions</a>. Not one.
And they won't fix them in the fifth
or sixth editions, either, because they consider Bill's religious
babbling to be sacred scripture that simply <i>cannot</i> be changed.
</font>

<p>
<a name="powerlessness"> </a>
POWERLESS AND UNMANAGEABLE MEANS UNDER THE INFLUENCE.  NOT WHILE SOBER!  WHEN WE DRINK WE
WANT ANOTHER DRINK AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.  WHEN WE DRINK THE RENT DOESN'T GET PAID, THE
HOUSE FORECLOSES, THE FAMILY GETS HURT, WE GET DUI'S ETC.  ALCOHOL MEANS MORE TO US THAN LIFE
ITSELF WHEN WE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF IT, WE WOULD GIVE UP LIFE ITSELF TO KEEP DRINKING ONCE
IT'S IN US.  WE DO THINGS WE NORMALLY WOULDN'T DO IF SOBER.  THE THEORY IS CORRECT I AM POWERLESS
AND LIFE BECOMES UNMANAGEABLE ONCE I DRINK.  THIS IS A REMINDER AND ADMISSION STEP TO THAT
FACT.  NOTHING MORE.  WE ARE ALSO POWERLESS OVER SOMEONE ELSE THAT CHOOSES TO DRINK.  WE CAN'T
STOP THEM. 
<p><font color="blue">
I agree that I am powerless over alcohol after I get 6 or 8 drinks in me.
I just want to <i>really</i> go for it and <i>*really*</i> feel good.
<i>&quot;The hell with tomorrow; don't worry about tomorrow;
don't think about how you will feel tomorrow; let's just feel grand tonight.&quot;</i>
<p>
But that is *not* what Bill Wilson was talking about when he made up Step One.<br>
Bill Wilson <i>did not</i> say that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;POWERLESS AND UNMANAGEABLE MEANS UNDER THE INFLUENCE.&quot;</font><br>
That is your own interpretation of Step One, not the official A.A. interpretation.
Bill was using
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group</a>
&quot;principle&quot; that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You
have been defeated by sin, and are powerless over it. You are insane, and only
<i>being changed</i> will restore you to sanity.&quot;
</font> (Being changed into one of Frank's followers, that is...)
<p>
The usual A.A. lecture on &quot;powerlessness&quot; says that you have no control over
alcohol, drunk or sober, period. A.A. dogma says that you cannot keep from taking
that first drink, no
matter how much you may wish to stay sober. Bill Wilson was quite insistent on that
point. He wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went carefully over that
evening in Washington.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
I now remembered what my alcoholic friends
<font color="#BF0000">
[Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith]
</font>
had told me,
how they had prophesied that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time
and place would come &#8212; I would drink again. They had said that though
I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before some trivial reason
for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and more, for what I had
learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I knew from that moment
that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will power and self-knowledge
would not help in those strange mental blank spots. I had never been
able to understand people who said that a problem had them hopelessly
defeated. I knew then. It was a crushing blow.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 41-42.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you are powerless over alcohol because you cannot control yourself at all &#8212;
you simply cannot help but relapse sooner or later.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Will power and self knowledge are useless.&quot;</i>
</font>
You cannot save yourself from death by alcohol no matter how you try,
so your only defense is to surrender yourself to God and hope that
He will save you:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental
defense against the first drink. Except in a few rare cases, neither
he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense
must come from a Higher Power.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Chapter 3, William G. Wilson,
<i>More About Alcoholism</i>, page 43.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, you may have your own understanding of alcoholism that is different from
the standard A.A. dogma. If so, good. I'm glad to hear that you are thinking for
yourself, and disagreeing with A.A. and Bill Wilson.
But the fact remains that the official A.A.
party line says that you are powerless over alcohol, period:
<ol>
<li> <b>&quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.&quot;</b>
<li> Alcoholics cannot control their drinking at all. The situation is <i>hopeless</i>.
<li> Alcoholism is a progressive disease that <i>always gets worse, never better</i>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any considerable

AA HAS BEEN A PLACE I GO TO HELP ME STOP DRINKING IT DID NOT IN AND OF ITSELF STOP ME. MOST AA'S

Good. It sounds like your group is saner than average. But that stuff <i>is not</i>
the official A.A. position, or the teachings of Bill Wilson, or what the average coerced
newcomer is indoctrinated with. And it isn't what other A.A. proponents are selling.
Check out
<a href="orange-powerless.html#self_sufficiency_myth" target="_blank">Jillian Sandell's

POWERLESS DOESN'T MEAN SITTING AND WAITING FOR GOD TO TAKE A MAGIC WOUND AND CHANGE OUR
LIFE.  ACTION TO CHANGE MUST COME FROM US &quot;WE DO THE FOOT WORK&quot; THE OUTCOME AND POWER
COMES FROM GOD AND US WORKING TOGETHER. 
<p><font color="blue">
I agree that the Lord helps those who help themselves. But,
the fact remains that the only part of the Twelve Steps that actually
says anything about really fixing you is Step Seven, where you beg God
to remove all of your &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral
shortcomings&quot;. You don't do anything to fix yourself.
You just beg God and then passively wait for God to fix you.
There is no &quot;plan B&quot;. (The fact that you have your own, better,
ideas about self-healing does not change what the Twelve Steps
actually, really, say.
This isn't a game of &quot;<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#alice" target="_blank">Words
mean just what I choose them to mean</a>.&quot;)
<p>
<b>NONE</b> of the Twelve Steps actually tell you to heal yourself
or to fix yourself (or to quit drinking, or to help anyone else quit drinking).
Quite the opposite: the Steps tell you
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">to hurt yourself</a>:
<ol>
<li> Induce feelings of helplessness, self-doubt, and inadequacy by
&quot;admitting&quot; that you are
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">powerless</a> (Step One), and by
<li> declaring that you cannot manage your own life (Step One), and by
<li> declaring that you are insane (Step Two).
<li> Surrender your will and your life to the cult (Step Three).
<li> Induce feelings of guilt by making lists of every sin or mistake
you ever committed in your entire life, and then confess them all to
somebody else (Steps Four through Ten). That really messes with people's
minds; it doesn't heal them.
<li> Induce more feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy by
coming to believe that you are so terribly defective and flawed
that only God can remove all of your defects and shortcomings (Steps Six and Seven).
<li> Induce an attitude of passive dependency and infantile narcissism
by just begging God to solve all of your problems for you and take
care of you (Steps Three, Six, and Seven).
<li> Induce more guilt by making lists of everyone you ever harmed or offended (Step Nine).
<li> <a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">Dabble in the occult</a>,
and practice channelling (Step Eleven) and become
delusional, imagining that the noises in your head are The Voice of God, talking
to you all day long, and telling you what to do.
<li> Become more delusional, by imagining that you have had a spiritual experience
or spiritual awakening from practicing Bill's cult religion (Step Twelve).
</ol>
<p>
Those problems with the Twelve Steps are likely the reason why A.A. treatment has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">a higher death
rate than no treatment at all</a>.

<p>
[Letter 4 from Pamela D.:]
<p>

the 12 steps are just tools to help us through a process of grief from
the wreckage of our past drinking.&nbsp; it is helpful to help us deal
with our lives.

<p><font color="blue">
No, they are actually tools for converting people into members of a cult religion.
Those &quot;tools&quot; served
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman</a>, who invented them,
very well while he built up his cult
in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties. Then Bill Wilson learned that cult
technology from the Oxford Groups while he and Doctor Bob were members of that cult.
</font><p>

<p>the program is full of paradoxes.&nbsp; by being powerless and turning
our lives over to a higher power, our higher power gives us the power to
be a better person.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Baloney.

&quot;The program&quot; is full of contradictions, errors and outright lies.
A.A. members say all kinds of things, and when you catch them in contradictions and
inconsistencies, they say that it's just a paradox, just a wonderful paradox.
<p>
For example, you began your second letter by insisting that you had never,
in your 13 years in A.A., ever seen the kind of abuses I had described in
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction</a>.
But before you finished that letter, you were describing even
worse abuses that you had seen with your own eyes. That is a contradiction, not
a paradox.
<p>
And <a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">declaring powerlessness</a> does not
paradoxically make people more powerful. It weakens people, and
undercuts their ability to stay sober.
That is one of the ways in which Alcoholics Anonymous indoctrination
<i>increases</i> the death rate of alcoholism. That has been clearly
established by
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank">good, impartial,
tests</a> of the Alcoholics Anonymous program.
<p>
All of that jabber about paradoxes is just another cult stunt designed to
make you stop thinking. If everything is paradoxical, and defies logic, then
what is the use of trying to think?
</font><p>

<a name="atheist1"> </a>
it sounds as though your agnostic or atheist.&nbsp;
i'm not sure.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
No, I'm not. Actually, it is none of your business what my religious beliefs are,
and they should not be relevant to a discussion of whether a treatment program for
alcoholism actually works.
But just for your information, I am neither an atheist nor an agnostic. I just try
to be sane and realistic in my religious beliefs.
(If A.A. is not a religion, why do you care so much about my religious beliefs?)
</font><p>

<a name="deceptive_recruiting"> </a>
however, no you can't have a door knob etc. for a higher
power, but it is said that way because the logic is to not make the newcomer
think were a religious organization going to be pushing &quot;God stuff&quot; on
him.&nbsp;
that is not our intent.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
So, you admit that you deceive the newcomers,
to keep them from getting the wrong idea?<br>
You hide the intense religiosity of
the Alcoholics Anonymous program
from the newcomers by telling them things that you know are not true at all (lies),
like that they are free to pray to a doorknob?<br>
<p>
That is called
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>&quot;,
and it is a standard practice of most all evil cults.
<p>
That is also a good example of the
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">
Bait-and-Switch con games</a> of Alcoholics Anonymous.
First, you tell the newcomer that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">
he can believe in anything, even <i>Doorknob Almighty</i></a>, but that
is really just a mind game designed to fool him into thinking that
you are open-minded and tolerant of other viewpoints. Eventually, he will
learn that he has to believe in the Alcoholics Anonymous version of God in
order to work the 12 steps.
</font><p>

again since when have i ever or
anyone i know experienced a sponsor stating that's fine believe in the
door knob, but later telling me i have to believe in God or i will drink
again.&nbsp; what!&nbsp; if some one individual is doing this that is there
wrong not aa.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
I've read and heard plenty of stuff that contradicts what you are saying.
A.A. literature contains stories of people doing things like
using a bedpan as their Higher Power.
And again, just because you haven't seen something happening doesn't mean that it is
not happening.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</i></font>

<p>
And yes, such ridiculous behavior &quot;is A.A.&quot;.
All of the stuff that is done by A.A. members is A.A..
You can't always use the dodge that it isn't A.A. because you don't
like it, or The Council doesn't approve of it, or it goes against
The Traditions, or something. If A.A. members are doing it in A.A. meetings,
or doing it to the newcomers, then <b>that really *is* A.A.</b>.
<p>
And even if it is just thinly-veiled propagandists like
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">Jeff Jay</a>,
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">Jillian Sandell</a>, or
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">Warfield and Goldstein</a>
publishing ridiculous cult philosophy lectures and spreading misinformation about
alcoholism, that is still a part of
the larger Alcoholics Anonymous organization.

</font><p>

aa has specific traditions and groups are not supposed
to be run that way.&nbsp; nor is anything to be crammed down any ones throats
so if it is being tell the person to run and go to a different group.&nbsp;
for crying out loud it's a free program and it's a support group.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
A.A. has some &quot;traditions&quot;, but they are pretty meaningless. Members violate
them whenever they feel like it. So does the A.A. leadership. Read Anthony's and
Mitchell K.'s descriptions of
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">A.A.W.S. at work</a>.
</font><p>

we are not professionals we are basic human beings trying to stay sober
one day at a time.&nbsp; you read way too much into this.&nbsp; many things
in this world probably seem cultish to you.&nbsp; doesn't mean it is.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
I'm reading too much into it? Or are you not reading enough into it? Aren't you
playing ostrich, keeping your head stuck in the sand, refusing to see any problems
with A.A.? (You are in denial.)
<p>
Let me ask you one question: When was the last time you called a judge on the
phone and strongly insisted that he never sentence another person to A.A. meetings,
because A.A. is just a free, voluntary support group, not a cult religion or a cure
for alcoholism, and you don't
want people forced to go to your meetings? Did you ever do that? Did you ever write
letters of protest to the court, complaining about coerced A.A. attendance?
Or do you just happily sign all of those court slips,
while pretending that it isn't your fault that people are coerced into A.A.?
<p>
If you really believed in freedom of religion, you would sign the slips at the
beginnings of the meetings, so that the coerced people could leave immediately.
Have you ever done that?
<p>
<a name="no_meds_story"> </a>
I know of one guy who did that. He said that he didn't really want coerced people
there; that it was a violation of the traditions.
He said that they were free to stay after they got their slips signed, if they wanted
to, but they didn't have to. They were free to go if they wanted to.
Heck, he even told them to bring a big handful of different-colored pens
the next time, and he would use the pens to sign off on all of their
meetings at once, to save them the trouble of coming back again.
<p>
But before you take the credit for his enlightened behavior,
let me tell you that he quit A.A. and hates it, because of the sponsors killing
mental patients by telling them to
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications" target="_blank">stop taking their medications</a>,
and then those mental patients committed suicide. He's one of the
old-timers who gave me a lot of the dirt on A.A..
And he has been in and out of A.A. for the last 30 years now, so I have no doubts
that he knows what he is talking about. (How many years have you been around A.A., 13?)
</font><p>
<a name="Biblical"> </a>
it's a program with specific biblical based steps to help a person spiritual,
mentally, emotionally, and physically heal.&nbsp; it is not a cure!&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Once again, no it is not.
The 12 steps are not Biblical at all. They were derived from the &quot;principles&quot; of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's cult religion, the Oxford Groups</a>.
The 12 steps are a formula for brainwashing people into being cult members.
Heck, even A.A. literature, like <i>Lois Remembers</i>, by Lois Wilson,
describes how Bill Wilson adapted
the <i>Six Practices of the Sane</i> from the Oxford Groups to write the Twelve Steps.
Really do go read
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">The Religious Roots of the Twelve Steps</a>.
<p>
And how can you say that A.A. is not a religion, if you believe that its Steps
are based on the Bible? That's another one of those contradictions...
Are you going to try to tell me that the Bible is &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;?
</font><p>

it's a helpful aid.&nbsp; i don't think anyone in aa has said to me if
you don't have aa you won't stay sober.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Just like how you had never, in your 13 years in A.A., ever seen cultish,
abusive, behavior in A.A.?
</font><p>

i happen to have a brother
that found religion and that's worked for him, great!&nbsp;
i don't shame him and say that.&nbsp; to each there own.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Is that your brother who calls A.A. a cult?
</font><p>

so confusing cause and
effect with coincidence or correlation or your other comment.&nbsp; i do
see the cause and effect, it is not a coincidence or a correlation.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
That's wishful thinking.
You are seeing what you wish to see, and nothing more.
<p>
Please explain <i>*precisely how*</i> you determined that there is a cause-and-effect
relationship &#8212;
not coincidence or correlation &#8212;
<ol>
<li>
between doing the 12 steps and not drinking, or
<li> between going to A.A. meetings
and not drinking, or
<li> between believing in the A.A. version of God and not
drinking...
</ol>
<p>
I <i>really</i> want to hear your answer to that, because all of the doctors
and scientists who have tried to establish such a relationship with valid tests
have failed to find any such cause and effect relationship. Not even A.A.-trustee
Prof. George Vaillant could find any. They all discovered that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">A.A. does not work at all</a>.
</font><p>

<a name="cult_withdrawal"> </a> 
it is fact aa has been helpful in helping me to stay sober.&nbsp; for one
year i stayed away from aa i was depressed and many of my old using behaviors
and ways of thinking came back.&nbsp;

i finally decided to go back to aa
and it helped with the depression, stress, fears, loneliness, and brought
me out of that funk.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Are you saying that you did a year of sobriety without A.A.? So A.A. is not really
essential, is it?
<p>
So, you were unhappy without Alcoholics Anonymous?
<p>
You are overlooking the fact that there really is such a thing as cult withdrawal.
People who leave cults are often miserable, depressed, lonely, and very confused.
They don't have anybody to order them around and tell them what to think and what to do,
so they feel lost. They aren't surrounded by the cult, so they feel lonely.
They don't have the cult telling them that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">they are special</a>, that they are
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#chosen_people" target="_blank">The Chosen people</a>, doing the Will of
God, so they feel like their lives are going nowhere. They feel like existence
is pointless.
Sometimes, it takes many years to recover from a cult. Or, they
don't recover &#8212; they relapse and return to the cult, like you did.
</font><p>

it is a positive group getting together for
a positive reason.&nbsp; what is so wrong with that.&nbsp; so they have
specific ways of doing things that's why it's call a program cuz it has
one, a program with steps and a founder with 100 other people's input into
the big book, it was what worked for many people and still does.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Worked to do what, exactly? You are all over the map with that one. You have said that
it doesn't make people quit drinking, that it doesn't cure alcoholism, and then you
say that it works. What works? Precisely what does it do?
</font><p>

that it kills people, your insane that aa kills people.&nbsp;
that's a
strong word.&nbsp; i think people kill people, but the aa program was probably
warped out to fit some sick persons needs.&nbsp; are you not well enough
to know sick people from well people and enough to tell people who come
to you to seek out a different group or people who are healthy.&nbsp; i
mean gesh!&nbsp; there are rapists and child molesters i'm sure sitting
around those tables just like there are at an ameritech office.&nbsp; you
just can't be so naive to think all groups and individuals in aa are working
the aa program as it was structured and intended to help people.

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, it is a strong word. But that is what Professor Vaillant (a member of the
Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, remember?) proved with his
own research. You keep on repeating
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">the Big Lie</a> that A.A. works, but you provide
no proof or evidence to support that statement.
I'm providing plenty of evidence to support my statements. Go read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
All of the valid tests of A.A., even Vaillant's own, have shown
that A.A. does not work at all, and in fact, even
increases binge drinking and raises the death rate, which means that A.A. kills.
</font><p>

who's a quitter or who said God would fix our shortcomings!&nbsp; who
said that, you did and once again the wrong interpretation is understood
by you again.&nbsp; i'm beginning to see how narrow minded and one tracked
you are.&nbsp; your very biased in your findings and twist things in your
very one sided understanding.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
Twisted?
Excuse me, but what part of Steps Six and
Seven do you not understand?<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<b>6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of
character.</b><br>
<b>7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</b>
</font>
<p>
And what part of
<a href="orange-letters4.html#Bills_sermons" target="_blank">Bill's sermons</a> do you not understand?
<p>

And, while you are accusing others of not understanding things, what part of
these two sentences do you not understand?
<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#BF0000">
1. &quot;...there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment
were no better than the natural history of the disease.&quot;
<p>
2. &quot;Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is your own leader, Professor George Vaillant, describing the results of his
8 years of testing the Alcoholics Anonymous program on alcoholics.
(You did go read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>, now didn't you?)
He found that A.A. did not work at all; it just raised the death rate.
And then Vaillant wrote,
<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;Once again, our results were no better than the natural history of the disorder.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Which means:
<font color="#BF0000">
IT DID NOT WORK. IT DID NOTHING GOOD.
</font>
<p>
Now that is plain English, not something all twisted around. You have to do some
pretty fancy tap-dancing and twisting of words to turn such an admission of total failure
into a declaration that the program works great and saves millions of lives.
</font><p>

others probably have your view too,
great, but there is other ways of interpreting this.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
What other ways of interpreting things? Either you speak the truth, or you don't.
</font><p>

if you turn
one's will over and defects etc. at no point does that mean your powerless
and should be a &quot;baby&quot; and just sit there and wait for the flash of light.&nbsp;
how warped of think and narrow your mind is.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
What part of Step One do you not understand?
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
<b>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.</b>
</font>
<p>
And Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence.
Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned, self-confidence
was no good whatever; in fact, it was a total liability.
Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a mental obsession
so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it.
There was, they said, no such thing as the personal conquest of this
compulsion by the unaided will.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 22.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, see <a href="orange-spirrecov.html#willful_ego" target="_blank">the 'powerlessness' rap of the
A.A. propagandists Warfield and Goldstein</a>. And read the file on
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">powerlessness</a>.

<p>
The fact that you don't like Bill Wilson's teachings changes very little.
It is Bill Wilson's opinions, and not yours, that get repeated in every A.A. meeting.
</font><p>

God or a power with
&quot;good&quot; as it's goal has a better plan for us than we did when we were drinking,
and for some of us even when we sober up.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Are you trying to imply that A.A. is a power with good as its goal?
<p>
You are now pushing a fascist agenda, you know. You are saying that because people
made mistakes before, and drank too much, that A.A. should now be allowed to run
their lives for them &#8212; because it has &quot;a better plan&quot;.
</font><p>

some of us still act and
behave inappropriately like a drunk even when we stop drinking.&nbsp; so
it is sobering up in all aspects of life.&nbsp; women stop sleeping around
and acting like horrors, men stop hitting on women like they were horrors,
and they learn to stop thinking like a drunk by hanging around people who
learned to live a more productive moral and ethical life.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
You seem to be getting into the
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunk</a>&quot; lecture now.
You miss the point that lots of people act terribly even without any help
from alcohol. You are also getting into the standard A.A. negative stereotype
of &quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The Alcoholic</a>&quot;, &quot;thinking
like a drunk&quot;.
And just how do drunks think? Are you going to tell me that all alcoholics think
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">just like Bill Wilson did</a>?
</font><p>

the big
book and bill wilson never once said they didn't believe in God.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
I never said that Wilson didn't believe, in spite of
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">his pretending to
have been an unbeliever</a>
in chapter four of the <i>Big Book</i>, <i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i>.
(But that's not too surprising &#8212; Bill even
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#jealous" target="_blank">pretended to be a woman</a> in the
<i>&quot;To Wives&quot;</i> chapter.) What I always said was that Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">a crazy religiomaniac</a> &#8212; a religious maniac &#8212;
and a fanatical true believer.
</font><p>

<a name="hide_God"> </a>
actually it's stated over and over how God in the aa program is the solution.&nbsp;
he states it plan and simple.&nbsp; however, when God is mentioned to a
newcomer sometimes they leave the program before they find out what it's
about.&nbsp; it's the cults and religious wacko's that these people hear
about that makes them right away think aa is a cult etc.
just cuz they hear the word &quot;God&quot;.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue"> So, you are admitting that you don't tell the newcomers the truth
about the God part of the program because you are afraid of what they will think.
You are afraid that they will walk out if you tell them the truth.
You are admitting that you are
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">practicing deceptive recruiting</a>.
<p>
This is how Bill Wilson described that routine:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little. They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts &#8212; absolute purity, absolute
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently
too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Not-God</i>, Ernest Kurtz, page 46,<br>
and<br>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 74-75.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, Bill Wilson hid the extreme religiosity of his program from the newcomers,
sanctimoniously proclaiming that &quot;they didn't want to get too good too soon&quot;
when they just wanted to get sober, and did not want to join a fanatical cult religion.
You just admitted that you are
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">doing the same thing</a> &#8212;
practicing deceptive recruiting, hiding the religiosity
of the program from the newcomers, because you know that they won't come back if
you tell them the truth about what a bunch of religious extremists you really are.
</font><p>

funny thing is the people who stay in aa for
many years all have a belief in God and the people who relapse and can't
stay sober don't have a God.&nbsp;
many have found this through research.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Please prove that statement. Where did you get that idea?
What test, survey, study, poll, or other &quot;research&quot; told you that
the relapsers didn't believe in God,
while the sober people did? I mean, <i>REALLY</i>, show me the research.
You made the claim, now back it up.

<p>
In addition, you are playing
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">the Either/Or propaganda trick</a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Either stay in A.A. and believe in the A.A. version of God,
OR ELSE you will relapse and not stay sober.&quot;<br>
</font>
What happened to the other logical possibilities? What about the people who do not believe
in the A.A. God, and who don't go to A.A. at all, but who stay sober anyway? There are millions
of them, too, you know. In fact, the Harvard Medical School reported that 80% of those people
who successfully quit drinking for a year or more
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">do it alone</a>.

<p>
Also, you deny that A.A. is a religion, and yet you also say that those who
stay in A.A. for many years all have a belief in God. That's another one
of those contradictions...
</font>

<p>
<a name="Biblical2"> </a>
so who cares if aa loves God and has steps and states that by turning our
human will over it will help empower us to be and do better things in our
life.&nbsp; it doesn't just happen cuz we ask.&nbsp; it's processes of
living life better and for the good of people.&nbsp; loving others "do
unto others as they would have done unto you".&nbsp; each step is taken
from the bible actually, so i would challenge you to look into how the
steps were formulated and see where they found God stating each one of
those steps.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
No, the 12 steps were not formulated from the Bible. They were formulated from
the teachings of the Hitler-loving minister Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman.
Have you bothered to read the file on
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">The Religious Roots of the Twelve Steps</a> yet?
</font><p>

there is a bible called the serenity bible showing where
each of the steps were taken from the bible and highlights it throughout
the bible.&nbsp; God wants us to come to him as children.&nbsp; not as
a child literally, but with wonder and openness and question.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, I know about the Serenity Bible. It's another one of those pieces
of A.A. propaganda that you should be ashamed of. Here's the Serenity Bible's
description of how the A.A. program changes people's religious beliefs:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We may start out as agnostics. We may then come to view the group
or recovery process as our higher power, looking to other
people for strength. Gradually, we accept a vague notion of god,
which grows to a more specific monotheistic god.
We may even begin to pray to and dialogue with this god.
Eventually we come to know the one true God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Serenity, A Companion for Twelve Step Recovery,
Complete with New Testament Psalms &amp; Proverbs</i>,
Dr. Robert Hemfelt and Dr. Richard Fowler, page 78.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So the A.A. program, which you claim is not a religion, will gradually
change newcomers' minds, and shove them through a religious conversion, and make
them come to believe in &quot;the one true God&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font><p>

see
you take things so literal you can't see beyond the statement to the true
meaning.&nbsp; i think there is a disorder that people have that can't
let them see cognitively past the face value of a sentence.&nbsp; maybe
you should look into that.

<p><font color="blue">
I don't play cultish word games. I believe that words mean what they mean,
period.  It is cults that claim that everything means something else.
<p>
In <i>Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass</i>,
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#alice" target="_blank">Humpty Dumpty said</a>,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean &#8212; neither
more nor less.&quot;<br>
</font>
That is fine for fairy tales, but here in the real world us sane people use words to mean
specific things, and do not always try to look beyond the words to find the
&quot;the true meaning&quot; Maybe you should look into that.
<p>
Eric Hoffer wrote about cult doctrines:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When some part of a doctrine is relatively simple,
there is a tendency among the faithful to complicate it and obscure it.
Simple words are made pregnant with meaning and made to look like symbols
in a secret message. There is thus an illiterate air about the most literate
true believer. He seems to use words as if he were ignorant of their true
meaning. Hence, too, his taste for quibbling, hairsplitting, and scholastic
tortuousness.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The True Believer</i>, Eric Hoffer, pages 79 to 80.</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, we see the practice of looking beyond the words, to find the &quot;true meaning&quot;.
This is old hat; Hoffer was especially writing about the Nazis, just after World War II.
</font><p>

<p>to generalize again that aa kills.&nbsp; well, i and many of my aa friends
that have been sober using the aa program for 10-20 years are not dead
so what!&nbsp; that is to general and way off&nbsp; the crazy train path.

<p><font color="blue">
How many? During those 20 years, how many thousands of people came looking for help,
got disgusted with your &quot;spiritual&quot; program, and went away?
How many died after you gave them the standard A.A. misinformation about alcoholism?
What has your real success rate been over the last 20 years? Don't just point at
a dozen surviving old-timers and then claim that the program works great.
You really only have a few dozen left out of thousands, don't you? That is what you
call massive failure.
</font><p>


<p>you are a member of aa by walking in the door.&nbsp; the only requirement
for membership it says in the tradition is to want to stop drinking there
are dues and fees for membership.&nbsp; did you ever read the traditions?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, I've read
<a href="orange-traditions.html" target="_blank">the traditions</a>.
I even own a copy of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
and criticize it in the file
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">Us Stupid Drunks</a>&quot;.
Anybody can make
up a bunch of phony instant &quot;traditions&quot;. It is quite another matter whether
people actually practice them.
<p>
You haven't really read many of my web pages, have you?
If you had, you would know that
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AA_traditions" target="_blank">I criticize A.A. for not
following its own traditions</a>, so of course I've read the traditions.

</font><p>

so your references continually go back to your own writings siting others
findings, but warping them out.&nbsp; aa you can come or go, belong don't
belong.&nbsp; so if people are giving aa a bad name and people who your
talking to are not smart enough to ask questions of what's truly supposed
to be going on then oh well they lose out on something great.


<p><font color="blue">
That's funny. You are afraid that stupid people will miss out on your wonderful
program?
<p>
And you complain about me citing other authors? Bill Wilson is the one I cite the
most. But I don't &quot;warp him out&quot;.
</font><p>


<p>aa is not religious!&nbsp; you can be from any denomination, Buddhist,
hindu, etc.&nbsp; all religions have a God, and they all believe that God
to be spiritual.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Wrong again. You just don't know anything about anything about world religions, do you?
Buddhism does not believe in a God or any supreme being of any kind.
Not all religions are like yours.
<p>
And A.A. is most assuredly religious. Just look back through this letter and count all
of the times that you have talked about God, and said that God is the answer.
That's a religion, no matter how reluctant you are to admit it.
</font><p>

we don't have to agree on who's God just having
one is great.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
Sure.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">
Surrender to the great god Lucifer</a>. Give him your soul in trade for him making
you quit drinking. It'll be okay, because all gods are just the same. Just having one
is great.
</font><p>

again bill wilson formed his steps off the bible and
after the oxford group who were a church group trying to stay sober and
had had some success with there approach to "helping" not fixing people.


<p><font color="blue">
No, once again, the Twelve Steps <font color="#BF0000"><i>ARE NOT</i></font>
based on the Bible, they are based on
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the fascist cult religion of
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>, the Oxford Groups.
<p>
Bill Wilson's own wife Lois wrote about how Bill wrote the 12 steps as part of
the <i>Big Book</i>, in December of 1938:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By this time Bill was ready to start the fifth chapter,
&quot;How It Works.&quot; He was not feeling well, but
the writing
had to go on, so he took pad and pencil to bed with
him. How could he bring the program alive so that
those at a distance, reading the book, could apply it to
themselves and perhaps get well? He had to be very
explicit. The six Oxford Group principles that the
Fellowship had been using were not definite enough.
He must broaden and deepen their implications. He
relaxed and <a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">asked for guidance</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he finished writing and reread what he had
put down, he was quite pleased. Twelve principles had
developed &#8212; the Twelve Steps.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<b>Lois Remembers</b>, Lois Wilson, Page 113<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Bill started with the six Oxford Group practices, and a couple of other ideas that
he got from Frank Buchman, like receiving occult
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank"><i>Guidance</i></a> in
&quot;Quiet Times&quot;,
and verbosely rewrote them into 12 steps.
<p>

Likewise, Bill Wilson wrote in one of his books:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Language of the Heart</i>, William G. Wilson, page 298.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So give it up.
The Twelve Steps are not based on the Bible, or derived from the Bible, at all.
</font><p>

so again i don't agree with your findings, and so lets agree not to
agree.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
What's that supposed to mean?<br>
I'm going to continue to tell the truth about A.A., regardless.<br>
I don't know for sure what you will continue to do, but I can guess...

about the negative side of A.A.? Don't worry. Far more often, I find that people are
relieved to hear that they aren't alone when they decide that A.A.
is just a crazy cult, and that they'd really rather get sober without
A.A., just like I did.

look at the catholic priest's right now.&nbsp;
the churches purpose is good, but some priest don't do good.&nbsp; is that
the catholic church for that priest responsibility for abusing boys, no!&nbsp;
the purpose of catholic belief's is good, but people don't always do good.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Wrong again. You are displaying bad logic one more time.
Yes, the Catholic Church is most assuredly responsible for the child
abuse and molestation that has been done by priests.
The bishops and cardinals covered it up, and protected the priests,
rather than fire them, and even reassigned the priests to other parishes,
leaving those priests free to do it all to some other children, again.
Cardinal Law just admitted as much, and resigned over it.
<p>
As President Harry Truman used to say, &quot;The Buck Stops Here.&quot;
<p>
Likewise, A.A. is responsible for the bad things that go on in A.A.. You can't
just rationalize it all away by saying that nobody is responsible, so lets just
forget it.

<a name="Wilson_freaky"> </a>
bill wilson never claimed to be a superstar etc.&nbsp; aa people are grateful
to him that's all, he is a founder that's all.&nbsp; HE'S WASN'T WEIRD
AND FREAKY NOR DID HE SAY STRANGE THINGS.&nbsp;
FURTHERMORE, NOR IS ANYONE IN THE GROUPS I'M IN.

<p><font color="blue">
Have you actually read the <i>Big Book</i>?
I get all of those weird, freaky quotes of Bill Wilson out of the <i>Big Book</i>
and his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
And I don't need to twist any words. He was such a raving lunatic with such
outrageous delusions of grandeur that it's pretty easy to make him look
weird and freaky just by quoting him.
Have you read the file
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">
<i>The Funny Spirituality of Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous</i></a>?
It's loaded with such quotes.
</font><p>



<p>AGAIN LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Why?
</font><p>

MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE PROVES
BEYOND A SHADE OF A DOUBT THAT IT'S AND ADDED HELPFUL SUPPORT SYSTEM.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Actually, the only thing that your experience really proves is that
you like Alcoholics Anonymous. It might even make you feel good, but that does
not prove that it is a &quot;helpful support system&quot;. You already said that
you did a year of sobriety without A.A., so it can't really be very
necessary for sobriety.
</font><p>

MANY HAVE BECOME GOOD FRIENDS TO ME.&nbsp; I'VE WATCHED PLENTY OF PEOPLE
USE AA TO HELP TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND.&nbsp; IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A
BONE TO PICK WITH THEM.&nbsp; REMEMBER IT'S YOUR BONE, WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO PROVE OR DESTROY AA.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Go read the lists. I've already typed them in:<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.</a>.<br>
<li> <a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Lies of A.A.</a>.<br>

<li> <a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>.<br>
</ul>
<p>
That should do for starters.

</font><p>

YOU EVER HEAR OF THE SAYINGS TO EACH THEIR
OWN OR IF IT WORKS DON'T FIX IT.&nbsp; WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT
ALONE CUZ IT WORKS FOR MANY, MANY PEOPLE.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
Well, it is broken, badly broken. It doesn't work as a therapy or quit-drinking
program at all. It's a cult religion that uses the legal and medical systems to
force more people into its meetings.
</font><p>


I PERSONALLY HAVE AT LEAST
5-10 THAT HAVE SOLD SOBRIETY OVER 10 YEARS WITH THE &quot;HELP&quot; OF AA.&nbsp;
SEE CUZ WITH OUT THE REMINDER OF OUR PROBLEM IF WE DRINK AND WHAT WILL
HAPPEN.&nbsp; SOMETIMES WE FORGET OR CHOSE TO FORGET BECAUSE WERE JUST
NOT REMINDED OF IT CUZ WERE NOT THINKING CLEARLY THAT MAYBE WE CAN DRINK
AGAIN SOMEHOW SOME DAY.&nbsp; THE OBESSES OF ALL ALCOHOLICS BY THE WAY.&nbsp;
THEN BAM!&nbsp; OUT THE BLUE WHEN NOT PREPARED WE THINK ONE DRINK WON'T
HURT, AND WE ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE ALSO WE'VE CONVENIENTLY FORGOT JUST
HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS FOR US OUT THERE.&nbsp; WHAT EVER THE REASON, IT IS
JUST HELPFUL TO HAVE A CONTINUED SUPPORT GROUP IN AA.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Go read the file on the <a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
I talk about the same stuff there. A.A. has no monopoly on that kind of information.
And you sure don't have to spend the rest of your life in meetings just to understand
that the little monster will keep on wanting a drink. You just tell him &quot;No.&quot;
And that saves a zillion hours wasted in meetings.
</font><p>

IT'S FREE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD AND FUN.&nbsp;
IT BECOMES A FAMILY IN MANY WAYS.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
It isn't free &#8212; they want your will and your life, just like any other cult.
And yes, it becomes your family, just like any other cult.
</font><p>


SO YOUR ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINION, BUT JUST LIKE THE WEIRDO AA'S YOUR A
WEIRDO IN THE OTHER DIRECTIONS.&nbsp; EXTREMIST AND NARROW MINDED ALWAYS
TRYING TO FIND THE BAD IN SOMETHING AND PROVE IT WRONG.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Once again, it is far more than a matter of just differing opinions.
People are being sentenced
and otherwise coerced into attending 12-step meetings. How would you like it if you
were sentenced to attend *my* re-education program where I will teach you what is wrong
with *your* thinking and *your* morals?
(And if you don't perform satisfactorily, and please your sponsor
so that he sends in good reports on you, then you will be in big trouble,
and will probably get put in jail...)
</font><p>


WELL, UNTIL
THEY FIND A CURE WITHOUT SOME OF US GOING TO THE GATES OF DEATH TO DRINK
AA HELPS THE PROCESS TO HELP SOME WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DIED.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Actually, &quot;they&quot; have found a cure, a very simple cure:
<b>Just quit drinking, and stay quit.</b>
</font><p>


SO DON'T TELL ME THEY DON'T HELP, THEY NEVER PROFESSED TO BE THE CURE.&nbsp;
THEY JUST WANT TO HELP.&nbsp; IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO STOP DRINKING
AND CHANGE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Then why do they use the courts to coerce people into joining their organization?
Why does the Hazelden Foundation even teach A.A. members to
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">indoctrinate officials
with the message that they should send people to A.A.</a>?
</font><p>

SO ALL THIS OTHER GARBAGE IS BACK
ASS BACKWARDS AND TWISTED AND WARPED INTERPRETATIONS.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Tell that to George Vaillant.
</font><p>

PROBLEM A PERSON
THAT'S BEEN THERE ONE TIME LOOK FOR ANY EXCUSE NOT TO HAVE TO BE THERE.&nbsp;
TAKING ONE THING SOMEONE SAID AND TWISTING IT.&nbsp; DOES THAT MAKE IT
GOSPEL, NO.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
What on earth are you talking about? You are degenerating into incoherency.
</font><p>

<a name="forced_help"> </a>
ALCOHOLIC'S ARE IN &quot;DENIAL&quot; REMEMBER WE'LL DO ANYTHING
NOT TO HAVE TO GET HELP IF COURTS ARE FORCING US TO GET HELP.&nbsp; SO
WE'LL TELL BAD STUFF JUST TO NOT HAVE TO GO.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
Thanks for once again demonstrating the arrogance of Alcoholics Anonymous.
You think that anyone who finds fault with the evils of A.A. is just &quot;in
denial&quot; and trying to avoid getting help? Go read the file
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">Us Stupid Drunks</a>&quot;
for more of your attitude.
<p>
And now you are also showing that you do like to have the courts
sentencing people to your religion &#8212; you call it &quot;COURTS ARE
FORCING US TO GET HELP.&quot; So please do not again pretend that
you are innocent in that regard.
</font><p>

IT'S ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.&nbsp;
SO WHAT IF A COUNSELOR SAYS AA WORKS!&nbsp; WELL, IT DOES IT GIVES A PERSON
A FREE SUPPORT GROUP AND STOPS LONELINESS, SO WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH THAT.&nbsp;
AA TALKS ABOUT NOT HAVING TO DO IT ALONE.&nbsp; WE &quot;HELP&quot; NOT CURE.
<p>


THE PAROLE OFFICER, JUDGE, WHO EVER THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM FOR SENTENCING
THE PERSON TO ATTEND AA MEETINGS.&nbsp; THEY SEND PEOPLE TO COUNSELING
FOR CHILD ABUSE ETC.&nbsp; SO&nbsp; AA IS A FREE SUPPORT GROUP WITH PEOPLE
WITH&nbsp; THE SAME PROBLEM AS THEM THAT WILL FREELY HELP THEM, SO WHY
NOT SEND THEM THERE.&nbsp; WHAT A WONDERFUL THING AND PURPOSE THEY HAVE
IN AA.


<p><font color="blue">
A.A. is a religious cult, not a free therapy program. It does not cure or treat
alcoholism.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">It does not work
at all, remember?</a>
<p>
Treatment of alcoholism is just one excuse that the 12-step religion
has for sucking people into the cult.
But there are plenty of other excuses, ranging from overeating disorders
to sexual obsession to diabetes to being a compulsive gambler. The
12-step program is real
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">snake oil</a> &#8212; supposedly
able to cure or &quot;treat&quot; anything.
<p>
And coercive recruiting is not just the judge's fault, or just the parole officer's
fault. The Hazelden Foundation teaches A.A. members to
go indoctrinate the judges, police, doctors, and ministers, and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">tell them to force people
into A.A.</a>, in order to &quot;help them.&quot; And A.A. has been
doing that for 60 years now. (And they learned that trick from the Oxford Groups,
so it's been going on even longer than that.
Ebby Thacher, Bill's sponsor, was recruiting out of a courtroom by the Oxford Groups
&#8212; specifically by Cebra Graves and Rowland Hazard.
Ebby was sentenced by Judge Graves, Cebra's uncle, to try the religious cure for
alcoholism, as an alternative to going to jail for habitual drunkenness.)

<p>
That is another standard dishonest
stunt that A.A. members pull: claim that they aren't individually responsible
for the standard practices that they are all collectively doing.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;What, me? I didn't force anybody into A.A.. It was my friend Sam who went
and talked to the judge. I just sign the slips when they come to the meetings.
I'm innocent.&quot;
</font>
</font><p>


<p>&quot;YOU ARE NOT REALLY SOBER; YOU ARE ONLY ABSTAINING, IF YOU AREN'T GOING
TO AA MEETINGS AND WORKING THE STEPS.&quot;&nbsp; WELL, OH WELL SOMEONE SAID
IT.&nbsp; DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE A AA THUMPER.&nbsp; LIKE I SAID AA
ISN'T A BAD THING AND DOESN'T KILL YAH.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
Yes, you have said it, but you don't know what you are talking about.
People who know a lot more than you have said that A.A. does not work and does
kill people, including Professor George E. Vaillant, the long-time Trustee of Alcoholics
Anonymous World Services, Inc.. (Oh, and he's still a Trustee, and still telling everybody
to go join A.A..)
</font><p>


I'D RATHER BE ADDICTED TO
AA THEN TO ALCOHOL IF I HAD A CHOICE TO TELL YAH THE TRUTH.&nbsp;
ONE WILL KILL ME AND ONE AT LEAST WANTS TO HELP SAVE ME.&nbsp;


<p><font color="blue">
Yes, that is the choice that you seem to have made. But it is not an either/or choice.
It isn't EITHER spend the rest of your life in A.A. OR ELSE you will suffer death by alcohol.
(That's the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">The Either/Or Technique</a>&quot;, and it's
bad logic.)
Most alcoholics who successfully quit drinking don't then substitute addiction to Alcoholics
Anonymous for addiction to alcohol. In fact, most alcoholics who quit drinking don't even use
Alcoholics Anonymous at all. The vast majority of them take one look at A.A. and walk
out, and go do it their own way. And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Medical" target="_blank">they do just fine</a> anyway.
</font><p>

SO LIKE I SAID YOU CAN'T TAKE EVERYTHING SO SERIOUSLY, LIGHTEN UP.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Hey, I'm light.
<a href="orange-jokes.html" target="_blank">Go read my jokes about recovery, and spoofs of A.A.</a>.
</font><p>


MANY THINGS
YOU CAN AGREE WITH AND THE REST LEAVE.&nbsp; THAT'S ONE OF THE SAYINGS
IN AA &quot;TAKE WHAT YOU WANT AND LEAVE THE REST&quot;&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, I know. It's also one of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what" target="_blank">the standard bait-and-switch stunts</a>.
First it's
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest,&quot;
</i></font>
and then it's
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;You can't ever leave.&quot;
</i></font>
And then it gets even worse: They say that you <i>must</i> do all of
Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps all of the time, or else you will die:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#BF0000">[Bill Wilson's required]</font> Twelve Steps to recovery,
he almost certainly signs his own death warrant.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So much for &quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;
</font><p>


<a name="dont_want_to_stop"> </a>
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO,
SAY, BE ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SO WATCH IT.&nbsp; I'VE HEARD SOME
PRETTY WARP IDEAS OVER THE YEARS ABOUT AA, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE
MOST ABOUT IT HAVE BEEN AROUND IT LONGER THAN A COUPLE MONTHS.&nbsp; CAREFUL
THE PERSON DIDN'T GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION ETC.&nbsp; AGAIN A DRUNKS DENIAL
LOOKS FOR ANYTHING TO REJECT ANY METHOD OF RECOVERY WHEN THEY DON'T WANT
TO STOP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'M DONE WITH THIS.

<p><font color="blue">
Again, you are demonstrating the arrogance of A.A.. Anyone who disagrees with you
is just an alcoholic in denial, trying to avoid recovery?
</font><p>



<p>ALL YOUR REFERENCES GO BACK TO ARTICLES YOU'VE WRITTEN AND QUOTED SOMEONE
ELSE.&nbsp;
WONDERFUL!&nbsp; IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE LOOKING FOR BAD IN SOMETHING
THAT HAS GOOD INTENTIONS.&nbsp; STOP HURTING THINGS THAT DON'T HURT OTHERS,
AND WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS ON REAL CULTS AND SATAN WORSHIPERS ETC.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
You really are not paying attention, are you?
<font color="#BF0000">
Bill Wilson is, by far, the single
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">most-quoted</a> person on my web site.</font>
No contest. Nobody else even comes close.
(You were complaining about me quoting
<a href="#Wilson_freaky" target="_blank">his &quot;weird and freaky&quot; statements</a>, remember?)
<ul>
<li> Do you really think that Bill Wilson was just looking for the bad in Alcoholics Anonymous?
<li> Do you imagine that he didn't know what he was talking about when he talked about A.A.?
<li> Do you think that I'm being unfair to A.A. by quoting Bill Wilson?
</ul>
<p>
And then I quote a lot of other A.A. boosters, like
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">The Hazelden Foundation</a>,
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">Jeff Jay</a>,
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">Robert Warfield and Marc Goldstein</a>,
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">Jillian Sandell</a>,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Professor George E. Vaillant</a>,
and others. Go read them.

<p>
Actually, if you want Satan worshippers, you should go read the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>,
which includes the question of selling
your soul to the Devil in trade for sobriety, and also describes the problems with
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">A.A. dabbling in the occult</a>.
<p>
Lastly, you say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;STOP HURTING THINGS THAT DON'T HURT OTHERS&quot;</font>.<br>

Well, that is the whole problem, isn't it? A.A. does hurt others.
A.A. hurts more people than it helps. A.A.W.S. Trustee 
Professor George E. Vaillant showed that Alcoholics Anonymous actually has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">the highest
death rate</a> of any alcoholism treatment program around, remember?
A.A. kills. That is what you call &quot;A THING THAT HURTS OTHERS&quot;.
</font><p>

<a name="experienced_God"> </a>

HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED GOD WORKING IN YOUR LIFE.&nbsp; WHEN YOU DO HE WILL
LET YOU KNOW IT'S FROM HIM, AND HIM ONLY.&nbsp; HE MAKES HIMSELF KNOW IF
YOU LOOK&nbsp; AND LISTEN.&nbsp; IF YOU DON'T THEN YOU WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE
HIM BECAUSE HE ONLY COMES TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR HIM.&nbsp; ARE YOU AFRAID
TO SEEK AND FIND?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
I could say a lot here, but I'm not going to get into a bragging contest
about religious or spiritual experiences. Suffice it to say that your
religious experiences, no matter
how great you consider them to be, have nothing to do with whether A.A. is harmful
to a lot of people, or whether A.A. is actually
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">an ineffective alcoholism treatment program</a>.
<p>
By the way, you are once again showing that A.A. is a religion. When I criticized
A.A., you responded by accusing me of being afraid to seek God, and of not experiencing
God. That is not only religion, it is also extremely arrogant religion:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Do you really think that you have a monopoly on God or spiritual experiences?
<li> Do you really believe that the A.A. dogma, especially the <i>Big Book</i>, is the
indisputable Word of God?
<li> Do you really think that anyone who disagrees with you is disagreeing with God?
<li> How do you know that God hasn't sent me on a mission to clean out the temple?
</ul>
</font><p>

HUMANS FAIL AND CAN'T SEE EVERYTHING OR KNOW EVERYTHING
IN THIS WORLD ON THERE OWN.&nbsp; TOGETHER AS A GROUP AND PUTTING ALL OUR
EXPERIENCES TOGETHER WE BEGIN TO TAP INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Baloney. Where did you get that goofy idea?<br>
If you put together 100 fools, you get a group of 100 fools, not a wise man.<br>
That's just like all of those public opinion polls that imply that the collected
opinions of 1000 ignorant, uninformed, couch-potatos will somehow add up to wise
counsel for the future of America.
<p>
And once again, yes,
I know the standard A.A. church doctrine about collective opinions.
I have read the 12 traditions.
I have my copy of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> in my
hands, and on page 132 I read:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority &#8212; a loving God as he
may express Himself in our group conscience.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 132.</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Group conscience? What group conscience? Who says that God is hanging out at the A.A.
meeting, expressing his opinions through the A.A. members?
That is very presumptuous:<br>

<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;I'm so Holy that every time I open my mouth,
God's opinion comes out.&quot;</i></font><br>

What if the &quot;group
conscience&quot; is nothing but the collective opinion of a bunch of dogmatic fools?
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
Besides, who decides what the &quot;group conscience&quot; really is?</font><br>

It is always the old-timers who dominate the rap with their well-practiced sermons.
<i>They</i> decide what God is saying today.
</font><p>

WE ARE MEANT TO HELP ONE ANOTHER, GOD WORKS THROUGH PEOPLE TO HELP ANOTHER
PERSON.&nbsp; SO AA BELIEVES IN GOD, IT WAS NEVER HIDDEN.&nbsp; YES, COUNSELORS
SOME BELIEVE IN AA, SO WHAT THAT'S OKAY.&nbsp; DOESN'T MEAN ALL COUNSELORS
DO.&nbsp; THERE ARE AGNOSTIC COUNSELORS AND ATHEIST COUNSELORS TOO.&nbsp;
THERE ARE SEPARATE GROUPS TARGETING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO RECOVERY GO
PICK ON THEM THEN TOO.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
That is bogus, broken, logic. Just because there might be an atheistic counselor
out there somewhere doesn't make it okay for the A.A. true believer counselors to shove
their cult religion on their patients. Besides, I said that I wasn't an atheist, remember?
So please stop trying to imply that I'm just an atheist who doesn't like <i>any</i>
religion.
I just don't like your cult, for a lot of
<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">good reasons</a>.
</font><p>

YOU WILL FIND ALL GROUPS HAVING STRUCTURE
LOOKING LIKE A CULT I SUSPECT, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE, IT'S CALLED
STRUCTURE AND PROCEDURES AND RULES NOT CULT.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Wrong, totally wrong. Broken logic again.
Once again, you are revealing that you haven't even read my web pages, have you?
Go read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>. It will tell you precisely what a cult
is, and how you can tell the difference between an ordinary church or religion, and
a cult.
</font><p>


SO REALLY STOP TAKING THINGS SO SERIOUSLY.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Seriously? Have you read
<a href="orange-jokes.html" target="_blank">my jokes</a> yet?<br>
(Please send me some of your recovery jokes
that poke fun at Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous. Heck, send any general-purpose
recovery jokes. The only ones I don't want are the
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank"><i>&quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot;</i></a> jokes
that A.A. members like to tell to put alcoholics down.)
</font><p>

OPEN YOUR MIND BROADER THAN WHAT IT IS.

<p><font color="blue">
Please can the arrogance. You keep accusing me of having a narrow mind.
But you apparently won't even read the words of Bill Wilson or Professor Vaillant
when they say things that you don't want to hear. And I've read all of the standard
A.A. books, and many of the less common ones, and even lots more pro-A.A. propaganda.
(That's where I get all of those quotes that you don't like, remember?)
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">See the Bibliography</a>.

<p>
How many anti-A.A. books have you read?
Why don't you read a dozen anti-A.A. and anti-cult books to
open your mind and help cure your narrow-mindedness? You can start with:<br>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cult_or_cure" target="_blank">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous, Cult or Cure?</i></a> by Charles Bufe, and<br>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#more_revealed" target="_blank">
<i>The Real A.A.</i></a>, by Ken Ragge.<br>
Both are now free to download on the Internet, so they won't even cost you any money.
So you have no excuse for not reading them, other than stubbornness and narrow-minded
willfulness.
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
(Oh, and I actually own 3 copies of the <i>Big Book</i>, 1 copy
of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, and also have copies of
several other 12-step books from A.A., N.A., and even O.A., Over-eaters Anonymous.
How many anti-A.A. or anti-12-step books do you own and read?)
</font>
<p>
(Heck, if you want free, you could also try actually reading my web pages, just for
a change. You repeatedly
ask questions, like whether I believe in God, or 'what is a cult?',
to which you would already have the answers
if you actually read my web pages.)
<p>
One of my favorite quotes in response to that &quot;Keep An Open Mind&quot; slogan
is James Oberg's remark:
<p>
<center>
<i>
&quot;Keeping an open mind is a virtue,<br>
but not so open that your brains fall out.&quot;</i>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. Thanks for writing.

[Letter 5 from Pamela D.:]
<p>

YES, IF YOU THINK ABOUT INSANITY WHY DID YOU KEEP DRINKING OVER AND OVER
EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS.  SOME HOW CHASING A DREAM THAT YOU COULD
HANDLE IT, THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.
<p><font color="blue">
No, not quite right. The part about thinking that I could handle it is true,
but none of those other lines are.
You are reciting
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the standard A.A. stereotype
of <i>The Alcoholic</i></a> again.
</font><p>

<a name="real_alcoholic"> </a>
AA TALKS ABOUT THE INSANITY
OF OUR THINKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND IN OUR THINKING WHEN WERE STONE
COLD SOBER STANDING AT THE GROCERY COUNTER READY TO BY A BOTTLE ONE
MORE TIME.  THAT'S PRETTY INSANE TO THINK SOBER YOU COULD HAVE ONE DRINK
WHEN AS SOON AS THE STUFFS IN YOUR MOUTH YOUR OFF TO THE RACES.  MAYBE SIR
YOUR NOT A TRUE ALCOHOLIC.
COULD YOU BE AN ABUSER OF ALCOHOL, BUT NOT AN
ALCOHOLIC?  MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF
AA.  IT'S AGAIN LIKE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO A NORMAL DRINKER WHAT KIND OF
THINKING AN ALCOHOLIC HAS, THEY JUST DON'T GET IT.
<p><font color="blue">
There is that avoidance technique again: If I don't conform to your
stereotype of <i>The Alcoholic</i>, then you try to claim that I'm
&quot;not a real alcoholic&quot;.
That is just a mind game where you try to ignore all of the alcoholics
who don't act the way that you expect.
Read the previous letters &#8212; Ken H. from the United Kingdom tried to do
<a href="orange-letters3.html#real_alcoholic" target="_blank">the same thing</a>, too.

<p>
Everybody who knows me, including my doctor, says that I am &quot;a real alcoholic&quot;.
<p>
And yes, I actually do &quot;get it&quot;. I understand what you are saying.
I understand the concept of A.A.. I just totally disagree with you.
<p>

You seem to be having trouble believing that I could actually know all about
A.A. and still disagree with you. You think I must be missing the point or
something. Well, that's because I can accept a few
facts that you are denying:
<ol>
<li> A.A. just flat-out does not work. It has a failure rate that is basically
100%.
<li> I know that A.A. is a cult religion, not a therapeutic program.
<li> The &quot;treatment program&quot; is hocus-pocus nonsense, pseudo-science

SPONSORS - KEEPERS, TAKE CARE OF YOU, ETC. WHAT!  HELL NO!  THEY DON'T ENABLE
AT ALL, AND THEY DON'T STAND FOR DENIAL SHIT AND MANIPULATION AN
ALCOHOLIC JUST SOBERING UP LIKES TO DO.  SOME ALCOHOLIC'S NEW IN THE
PROGRAM PLAY GAMES JUST TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND DRIVEN AROUND ETC.  THEY
USE THE SPONSOR MANY TIMES VS THE SPONSOR "BEING A KEEPER".    SO WHERE ARE
YOU GETTING THIS INFO. TWISTED EVERY POINT AROUND, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

<p><font color="blue">
What are you talking about? I never said that sponsors would take care of people
and wait on them. What I did say was that some members are very narcissistic and
expect
<font color="#BF0000"><i>God</i></font>
to take care of them and to solve all of their problems for
them. That's Step Three:
<font color="#4f007f">
We turned our wills and our lives over to the care of God...</font>
<p>
I do recall having used the word &quot;keeper&quot;, but that does not mean
&quot;servant&quot;. It means something more like boss or jailer.
<p>
Just to make sure I wasn't too far off base, I just grabbed my dictionary:<br>
The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition, says:<br>
<font color="green">
<ul>
keeper 
<ol>
<li> One that keeps, esp.:
<ul>
<li> <b>a.</b> An attendant, guard, or warden. 
<li> <b>b.</b> One who has the charge or care of something.

<p>

SO THE INVENTORY IS TAKEN TO SHOW A PATTERN OF THINKING THAT THE
ALCOHOLIC SO OBVIOUSLY PRACTICE AND HAS WHILE DRINKING.  RATIONALIZATION
TO DRINK, MINIMIZING DRINKING, JUSTIFYING DRINKING, BLAMING OTHERS, LYING,
MANIPULATING, HARMING OTHERS.  ARE GOOD DIDN'T GET US DRUNK NOW DID IT.  IT'S
NOT ABOUT SHAMING US IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AT REALITY AND UNSHAMING
OURSELVES.  LIFTING THE MONKEY OFF OUR BACK, FREEING US OF OUR PAINS.  IT'S A
RELIEF AND FREEING EXPERIENCE TO SEE A PATTERN AND IT ALL MAKES SENSE THAT
WE HAVE A DISEASE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY US AS A PERSON, BUT THE DISEASE THAT
MAKES US DO TERRIBLE THINGS TO OUR SELF AND OTHERS.  THE TERRIBLE THINGS
HURT US AND CAN EVEN KILL US.  YES, BY ALL MEANS IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
MANY AA'S ADD POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES TOO.  WHAT EVER WORKS!  HOWEVER, IT IS
NOT SHAMING IT IS LIKE CONFESSION.

<p><font color="blue">
You're doing it again: trying to push the standard stereotype of <i>The Alcoholic</i>.
Maybe you were all of those things &#8212; a liar, blaming others, manipulating, rationalizing,
minimizing, harming. But I wasn't. I just drank too much alcohol, until my doctor
told me to quit drinking, or I would die.
<p>
You see, stereotypes don't work. People are all different.
You are pushing a program that is really only
appropriate for one patient: Bill Wilson.
<p>
And alcoholism is not a disease, no matter how much you like to see things fit into
your little pattern.
The &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot; is like the &quot;disease of
<a href="orange-jokes.html#candyism" target="_blank">candyism</a>&quot;,
which is the illness that children get from eating too much candy.
<p>
While you like to imagine that you are being &quot;rigorously honest&quot;
while you do your Fourth Steps, you
are actually using the idea of alcoholism as a disease as a big fat cop-out, to
avoid taking responsibility for your own actions:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It wasn't me, the disease made me do it.&quot;.</i></font><br>
That's just like Flip Wilson's character &quot;Geraldine&quot;, who was always
proclaiming,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It isn't my fault. The Devil made me do it.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>

And yes, I can understand how you find it an immense relief to start
believing that &quot;the disease&quot; made you do all of those things
&#8212; that it wasn't really you doing them. But that is still just a cop-out.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
It was you who did all of that stuff, not an imaginary disease.<br>
It was you who wanted to get high.<br>
It was you who wanted to feel good.
</font>
<p>


<p>
<font color="green">
And since when is confession not shaming?<br>
</font>
Are you proud of your &quot;sins&quot; and &quot;wrongs&quot; and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;?<br>
Do you brag about your crimes during your Fifth Steps?<br>
Do you believe that God gives you extra Brownie Points for confessing really juicy stuff?<br>
<p>

You are in denial.<br>
You are so totally out of touch with your own feelings that
you cannot even see that doing a Fourth Step and listing all of your
&quot;sins&quot;, &quot;wrongs&quot;, &quot;defects of character&quot;, and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot; actually makes you feel guilty.

<p>
You are getting fooled by the standard cult practice of engineering experiences.
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">
Robert J. Lifton</a> called it <i>Mystical Manipulation</i>, and described it as,
<p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<li> Everyone is manipulating everyone, under the belief that it advances
the &quot;ultimate purpose&quot;.
<li> Experiences are engineered to appear
to be spontaneous, when, in fact, they are contrived to have a deliberate
effect.
<li> People mistakenly attribute their experiences to spiritual
causes when, in fact, they are concocted by human beings.<br>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
How it works is, you feel worse and worse as you do your Fourth Step, making long
lists of all of your sins, defects, wrongs, and moral shortcomings.<br>
You feel guilty and inadequate.<br>
The pressure and anxiety builds up inside of you.<br>
Then you do your Fifth Step, and break down and confess everything to someone else.<br>
When it is over, the sudden release of tension feels good.<br>
You are relieved that it is finally over.<br>
You mistakenly interpret that feeling of relief as a spiritual experience,
and you imagine that you have been relieved of your sins. You call it,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;LIFTING THE MONKEY OFF OUR BACK, FREEING US OF OUR PAINS.&quot;

<p>
It's just like the guy who beats his head against a wall because:<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson always insisted that the only way you could save your life was to surrender to
God and hope that God would save you.
<p>

Nevertheless, I disagree with both of you. The way the most people succeed is by doing
it themselves, pretty much alone. And that isn't just my opinion &#8212;
The Harvard Medical School
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">says so</a>.
</font><p>

IN A STUPOR UNFORTUNATELY WE DO BAD AND GOOD THINGS TO
OURSELVES AND TO OTHERS THAT IS WHY THE &quot;MORAL INVENTORY&quot;.
<p><font color="blue">
No, the reason that you do a moral inventory is because Bill Wilson was a member of
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the Oxford Groups</a>, and they
taught him to do moral inventories.
They also taught him that alcoholism was caused by sin, and that confession was
the cure for sin. So in A.A., you make long lists of your sins (renamed to &quot;wrongs&quot;,
&quot;defects of character&quot;, and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;) and then you
confess them (renamed to &quot;admitting&quot; them) to another group member.
That is all old standard Oxford Group practices. Bill didn't invent anything new.
And Bill didn't derive anything from the Bible.
</font><p>
<a name="sins"> </a>
WHERE IN THE BIG BOOK DOES IT SAY ALCOHOLISM IS A SIN?
<p><font color="blue">
It doesn't. It is implied by Bill Wilson's statements that you have to &quot;admit&quot; (confess)
all of your &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; (sins)
and &quot;resentments&quot;
&#8212; holding nothing back &#8212; in order to overcome alcoholism.
<p>

Bill felt that moral problems were the cause of alcoholism (because that's what Frank Buchman's
Oxford Groups told him.) Bill wasn't much into the disease concept of alcoholism &#8212; that
was Dr. Silkworth's idea. Bill just liked the sin idea.
<p>
<a name="cause_list"> </a>
Bill was really all over the map when it came to saying exactly what the real cause of alcoholism
was. Standard A.A. dogma teaches us that alcoholism is a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;
that is caused by
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-interpreted.html#moral_inventory" target="_blank">sins</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-interpreted.html#sin_model" target="_blank">moral shortcomings</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-interpreted.html#remove_defects" target="_blank">defects of character</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">resentments</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#runwild" target="_blank">instinct run wild</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#instincts_gone_astray" target="_blank">instincts gone astray</a>,

or
<li> <a href="orange-heresy.html#childhood" target="_blank">inherited genes or inherited sins</a>.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
Bill didn't use the words
&quot;sin&quot; or &quot;confession&quot; much in the <i>Big Book</i>
 because Bill was afraid of offending
the Catholic Church, which would have then banned his group just like
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Catholic_ban1" target="_blank">it banned Frank Buchman's
Oxford Groups</a>.
The Catholic Church has a rule against public confessions.
So Bill used the words <i>&quot;defects of character&quot;</i>
and <i>&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;</i> instead of &quot;sins&quot;, and he used the word
<i>&quot;admit&quot;</i> instead of &quot;confess&quot;.
(And then Bill also made up the phony story about how <i>&quot;A.A. is
not a religious group, it's only spiritual&quot;</i> in order to
mollify the Catholic Church, which would have banned anything that
it saw as a competing religion.)
<p>
But later, in his second
book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, Bill reverted to
using the words &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;confession&quot; throughout the book.
Haven't you even read <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> during
your 13 years in A.A.? (Go check out
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">one of Bill's sermons in 12x12</a>.)
<p>
<a name="sins_defects"> </a>
Read <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> for clearer descriptions
of Bill's insane theology.
There, he said that &quot;character defects&quot; and &quot;sins&quot; were the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Since most of us are born with an abundance of natural desires,
it isn't strange that we often let these far exceed their intended
purpose.
<font color="#BF0000">[Whose intended purpose?]</font>
When they drive us blindly, or we willfully demand that they supply
us with more satisfactions or pleasures than are possible or due us,
that is the point at which we depart from the degree of perfection
that God wishes for us here on earth. That is the measure of our
character defects, or, if you wish, of our sins.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 65.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how Bill declared that we were given natural desires by Something with
a purpose in mind. Bill thought that was God, of course. But Bill also
declared that we are in control of those desires, and have let them exceed
their proper operating parameters
<font color="#BF0000">[which are what?]</font>, which ends up being
yet another &quot;sin&quot;. How did we get to be in control of our desires,
when we are &quot;powerless&quot; over the desire to drink alcohol?
<p>
Also note that Bill was so confused that he thought that desires gave us
&quot;satisfactions or pleasures&quot;. They don't. Desires are an itch
to go get some satisfactions or pleasures. Hunger, for instance, does not give
us any satisfactions or any pleasure. It gives us a big pain in the belly that
drives us to go find some food.

</font><p>

OUR BAD MORE CONDUCT MAKES US AS
HUMANS FEEL SHAME.  SOCIETY HAS SET STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND WHEN WE
DON'T ABIDE BY THAT CONDUCT WE ARE BAD, SO IN SOME RESPECTS IT IS A DISEASE,
BUT CAN BE HELPED MY EVALUATING WHAT THE DISEASE MAKES US DO UNDER THE
INFLUENCE THAT GETS US FEELING ASHAMED AND DO BAD.
<p><font color="blue">
It isn't a disease, and &quot;the disease&quot; isn't making us do anything.<br>
We do what we want to do, and we do it because we want to feel good.<br>
And yes, some people should be ashamed of what they do while drunk.<br>
Some people should even quit drinking, because of what they do while drunk.<br>
</font><p>

THE WHOLE THING IS A
PROCESS OF IF I DRINK I DO THIS, IF I DRINK I DO THIS.  THESE THINGS ARE &quot;BAD FOR ME
AND &quot;WRONG&quot; FOR ME.  THESE THINGS DON'T MAKE ME A BAD PERSON, BUT THESE
THINGS I WILL CONTINUE TO DO IF I DON'T SEE THAT THE DRINKING IS KILLING ME.
<p><font color="blue">
Now that is logical. That is the same thing as they say in

</font><p>

IT'S
TO HELP BRAKE DOWN DENIAL AND HELP US SEE WHAT WE'VE BECOME.  SOME DON'T
WANT TO SEE, SO THE STEPS HELP BRAKE THE DENIAL DOWN BEFORE THE DRUNK
CHOOSE TO IGNORE IT AGAIN AND DRINK INSPITE OF HORROR CONSEQUENCES.
<p>
TO
DRINK IS TO DIE, AND AA TAKES HELPING SAVING LIVES VERY SERIOUSLY.  &quot;TOUGH
LOVE&quot;  TELLING PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HERE, IT'S THE
TRUTH AND THE TRUTH HURTS SOMETIME.


<p><font color="blue">
Again, you are just parroting the standard sermon about the stereotypical alcoholic. 
Bill Wilson thought that alcoholism was a moral problem, not a medical problem,
and that's why he wanted to cure it with confession and prayer.
<p>
Not all alcoholics are &quot;in denial&quot;. In fact, most aren't &#8212;
that's just the standard A.A. negative stereotype of <i>The Alcoholic</i>, yet again &#8212;
so not all alcoholics need something like a confession session to
&quot;break down the denial&quot;.
Likewise, we don't need any
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">&quot;tough love&quot; programs to crush our egos</a>.
(And we <i>really</i> don't need any more 
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">&quot;tough love&quot; boot camps 
to kill our children</a> for us.)
<p>

Remember that 80% of all of the
alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year or more
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
do it alone</a>,
without the crazy A.A. program, or the 12 steps, or any
confession sessions, or any praying and meditating until you think you are
hearing the Voice of God in your head.<br>
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
The truth is, most alcoholics
do not fit A.A.'s stereotype of <i>The Alcoholic</i>,
and most alcoholics are not helped by
the A.A. program. &#8212; So there is absolutely no justification for
using the criminal justice and
health systems to force people into A.A. &quot;for their own good&quot; &#8212; to, as you
called it, &quot;make them get help&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Have you ever heard about the old Greek story of a guy named Procrustees?<br>
Procrustees was a very welcoming host, and loved to get house guests. But when bed time came,
he made every guest fit into his one guest bed &#8212; by stretching the short people, and chopping
the feet off of the tall people.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous tries to fix all alcoholics the same way &#8212; by shoving the one-size-fits-all
12-step program on everybody, and by assuming that all alcoholics are just the same:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They all have the same 'character defects', and they
can't think correctly, and they are all in denial, etc....&quot;<br>
</font><p>
But that just isn't true.

[Letter 11 from Pamela D.:]
<p>

AA SAYS IN THE 3RD STEP A BELIEF IN A POWER GREATER THAN OURSELVES.  WHY ACT
LIKE AA NEVER SAID THIS.  THEY DON'T HIDE THAT THEY WANT YOU TO GET A HIGHER
POWER BUDDA, WHAT EVER.  NOT GOD AS YOU THINK, BUT AS EACH PERSON
UNDERSTANDS HIM.  GOD IS YOU TO GENERALIZE ALL DIFFERENT GOD'S HERE.  IT'S
LIKE &quot;KLEENEX&quot;  THERE'S A GENERAL TERM FOR MANY DIFFERENT BRANDS OF
KLEENEX.

<p><font color="blue">
Baloney. Get real. It cannot be just any old Higher Power, and it cannot be a
doorknob or a bedpan. We've already been over this.
<p>
And once again, please learn something about world religions before you start
talking about them. Buddhism does not have a God or a Supreme Being or
a &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
<p>
And the word &quot;God&quot; is not generic at all.
It is specific to the Christian religions.
Only Christians use that three-lettered word.
Jews use the word <i>Yahweh</i>, Hindus talk about <i>Ram</i> and <i>Krishna</i>
(and many other minor deities),
Moslems use the word <i>Allah</i>, and Buddhists don't use any word at all.
Only an ignorant Christian could imagine that the word &quot;God&quot;
is acceptable to all religions.

<p>
And A.A. does not allow you to have just any old supernatural being for your Higher Power.
In the beginning, they say that you can, but they lie. That's just
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#kind_of_God" target="_blank">another bait-and-switch stunt</a>.
In order for you to work the steps, you <i>must</i> have a &quot;God &quot; who will:
<ol>
<li> make you quit drinking (Step One).
<li> restore you to sanity (Step Two).
<li> take care of your will and your life for you (Step Three).
<li> listen to your confessions and maybe give a Rat's Ass about them
(and, presumably, then grant absolution without a priest assigning any penance) (Step Five).
<li> answer your prayers, and remove all of your &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; (Step Seven).
<li> answer your prayers, and teach you by sending you information and guidance, and
sending you work orders for the day and the power to do the work (Step Eleven).
<li> give you a religious or spiritual experience (Step Twelve).
</ol>

If &quot;God&quot; won't do all of those things for you, then that
blows the Twelve-Step program, doesn't it?<br>
So &quot;God&quot; really has to be your servant, doesn't It?
<p>

Ask yourself, in A.A.,
<ul>
<li> Can you have a God who won't answer your prayers and grant your wishes?
<li> Can you have a God who won't take care of your will and your life for you?
<li> Can you have a God who won't remove all of your &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;?
<li> Can you have a God who won't talk to you in Step Eleven, and give you <i>Guidance</i>,
work orders, and power?
<li> Can you have a God who won't bother to make you quit drinking?
<li> Can you have a God who won't save you from alcoholism?
</ul>
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
No.
</font>
<p>
So It can't be just any Higher Power or &quot;God of your understanding&quot;. It must be
the authoritarian, micro-managing,
order-dictating, slave-driving, wish-granting, prayer-answering, defect-removing,
message-transmitting, <i>Guidance</i>-sending patriarchal
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">God of Dr. Frank Buchman, William Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith</a>.
Otherwise, the 12-step program can't work.

THOUGHTS WILL NOT GET THEM IN TROUBLE OR DRUNK.  LIKE &quot;I CAN GO TO A BAR
AND NOT DRINK&quot;  WELL, NOT A GOOD IDEA.  THEY PROBABLY WON'T DRINK, BUT IT'S
JUST NOT A GREAT IDEA TO FREQUENT A BAR WHY TEMPT YOURSELF TILL YOUR
STRONG ENOUGH TO HANDLE IT.  EVENTUALLY AA'S CAN GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN THE
BEGINNING WE'RE JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND WE HURT AND HAVE FAMILY
TROUBLE ETC. WE'D STILL LIKE TO ESCAPE WITH  THE DRINK SO IT'S BEST WE WATCH
OR HELP EACH OTHER STAY SOBER IN THE BEGINNING.  OR KEEPING DRINKING
BUDDIES AND HAVING THEM OVER TO DRINK AT YOUR PLACE THE DAY AFTER YOU
SOBER UP.  NOT TO SANE AND NOT REALLY &quot;REASONING&quot; NOW IS THE NEW PERSON IN
THE BEGINNING.  THEY HAVE NO CLUE, BUT LITTLE WHAT MIGHT AND MIGHT NOT BE
HELPING GET THEM DRUNK.  AA HELPS THE TO LOOK AT THOSE THINGS TO HELP THEM
NOT DRINK, AND STAY SAFE.

There is that funny illogical twist again. I
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#adult_child" target="_blank">already described it</a> on the
&quot;bait-and-switch&quot; web page:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
First, you are an adult, and then you are a child.</font><br>
<ul>
<li> First, you are a responsible adult who drinks too much,
and you are causing your own problems, and it's all your own fault.
Bill Wilson says,
<font color="#8f00bf">
<i>&quot;After all, our problems were of our own making.&quot;</i>
</font>
<font size="-1">
(The <i>Big Book</i>, page 103.)</font><br>

<li> Then, you are a responsible adult who makes the decision
to quit drinking, and join A.A..
<li> Then, you are just a foolish child who isn't qualified
to make his own choices any more.
You must be supervised by your sponsor
and the other A.A. group elders to keep you out of trouble,
because &quot;your thinking is alcoholic.&quot;
<ul>
<li> &quot;Stop your stinkin' thinkin'.&quot;
<li> &quot;You have a thinking problem, not a drinking problem.&quot;
<li> &quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;
<li> &quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth.&quot;
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
In the background, you can hear someone wailing,<br>

<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;But if
you give them the freedom to make their own choices, they will make
the <i>wrong</i> choices...&quot;<br>
</font>

Indeed. That is why Alcoholics Anonymous is a fascist organization.<br>

<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li> The fact that someone may think some stupid thoughts sometimes,
especially during the first few months of recovery, does not mean that
they should
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">abandon human intelligence
or reason</a>. That is intellectual suicide.
<p>
<li> Someone who just quit drinking and is battling to stay sober needs
to have their wits about them more than ever. They really need all of
the intelligence and reason that they can get.

<p>
<li>
Your claim that people, especially the newcomers, cannot trust their own thinking
is yet another
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">standard cult characteristic</a>.

Cults always tell their members that their minds are messed
up, and that they cannot be trusted to think for themselves, and that they should
just obey the orders of the leaders. You say:
<font color="black">
<ul>
<li> THEY DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT JUDGEMENTS
<li> THEY CAN'T REALLY TRUST THEIR THOUGHTS
</ul>
</font>
<p>
<li> You know, the funny thing is that
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>the vast majority &#8212; 80% &#8212;</i></font>
of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">do it alone</a>,
without A.A. or any sponsor to supervise their thinking. They continue to think
for themselves, and they succeed in quitting. So your whole rap about how feeble-minded
newly-sober alcoholics are, and how much they need A.A. to hold their hands and
keep them out of trouble, is a bunch of bull. You are just rationalizing the role
of sponsors in the cult. (With your 13 years, you <i>are</i> a sponsor, aren't you?)

<p>
<li> Your characterization of newly-sober people as
mentally incompetent is part of
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the standard Alcoholics Anonymous negative stereotype</a>
of &quot;The Alcoholic&quot;.
<p>
<li> Such eager willingness to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">throw human intelligence and reason
into the trashcan</a> is really pathetic.<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
Are you telling us that you really
do believe that <i>your own mind</i> is totally worthless?<br>
</font>
Or is it just other people who should yield to your superior mind?<br>

[ Letter 14 from Pamela D.: ]
<p>
cult attitude, this is insane!&nbsp; cuz i believe it's helpful and it
is a &quot;program&quot; with specific steps to follow.&nbsp; there are plenty of
&quot;programs&quot; with other ideas.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
It is still a cult, no matter what you believe. Your beliefs are irrelevant, really.<br>

And the fact that there are other programs with other ideas is also irrelevant,
and has nothing to do with whether A.A. is a cult.
</font><p>

this is the program i tend to lean to
for support.&nbsp; they do not run my life, nor am i shamed or coherced
to keep coming back.&nbsp; it's our choice.&nbsp; they say it all the time
&quot;suggestions&quot;&nbsp; not rules or your out.
<p><font color="blue">
They say a lot of things, and contradict themselves constantly.
</font><p>

<p>i believe your distorting a &quot;good&quot; thing.&nbsp; if the purpose is towards
good it can't be bad.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;if the purpose is towards good it can't be bad.&quot;<br>
</font>

That simple-minded remark really takes the cake.<br>
You actually are completely disconnected from reality, aren't you?
<p>
All of these things started with &quot;a purpose towards good&quot;:

<li> Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party
<li> The War in Vietnam
</ol>
</font>

<p>
we do not become worse people from experiencing
love, hope, peace, serenity, giving, praying, etc.&nbsp; all these things
are good things.

<p><font color="blue">
That sounds okay.
</font><p>

<p>again i am not a &quot;big book thumper&quot;, so i take what i want and leave
the rest.&nbsp; i am not shunned for that.&nbsp; to each there own.&nbsp;
i am very respected in aa, and i don't take bullsh..&nbsp; so if someone
were to say some of the things you've said others are experiencing i would
ignore it.&nbsp; i can't help people distorting things.&nbsp;&nbsp; hey
if it works for them, don't fix it.&nbsp; what ever it takes to stay sober.
<p><font color="blue">
Yes, but newcomers get told different things. You yourself have admitted that
you don't tell newcomers the whole truth, out of fear that they won't come
back if you do.
</font><p>

<p>i get the feeling you don't believe in the disease concept.&nbsp; i
do.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
&quot;Believe in the disease concept&quot;.
Now that's funny. You make it sound like a new religion.<br>
...Hmmm... On second thought, <i>IT IS A NEW RELIGION!</i>
</font><p>

if i have a drink my inhibitions lower and before you know it
my body wants more.&nbsp; the consequences are pushed to the wayside once
the drink lowers my inhibitions.&nbsp; "normal drinkers"&nbsp; don't crave
more.&nbsp; they are different in that respect.&nbsp; do i hate them, no!&nbsp;
they just don't understand how a drunk can sit at the bar swearing i'm
only going to have a "couple" and go home.&nbsp; after banging his head
on the bar drunk wondering why he can't stop.&nbsp; it's physical, and
mental.&nbsp; this is my own experience.&nbsp; again the alcohol makes
us hit bottom, only alcohol can do that.&nbsp; we have to get to the point
we see it's killing us.&nbsp; once we do help is helpful to maintain sobriety.&nbsp;
it's also helpful to give back what we got.&nbsp; what's so wrong with
giving?
<p>

<p><font color="blue">
You are comparing apples and oranges. Yes, alcoholism is bad, very bad.
But that doesn't make Alcoholics Anonymous a good organization.
</font><p>


&quot;sometimes quickly sometimes slowly it will always materialize if we
work for it&quot;

<p><font color="blue">
<i>Always?</i><br>
Such absolute terminology is
<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#black_and_white" target="_blank">cult talk</a>.
That's just as dumb
as saying, <i>&quot;if the purpose is towards good it can't be bad.&quot;</i>
<p>
And
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises" target="_blank">that quote from
Bill Wilson's Promises</a> is also a good example of the propaganda stunt of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">lying with qualifiers</a>.
Wilson's statement is only true &quot;<i>IF</i> you work for it.&quot; (And who decides
whether you did a good job of working for it? Bill Wilson, that's who.)<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You will <i>ALWAYS</i> get great benefits from my wonderful miraculous program,
<i>IF</i> you aren't a spiritual slob.&quot;</font><br>
Wilson made grandiose, sweeping claims, and then inserted a qualifier to cover his
ass when they were proven untrue:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, she didn't work for it hard enough...&quot;</font>
</font><p>


bill states we have to work for &quot;sobriety&quot; it's hard
to change our old &quot;using&quot; mentality, cheating, stealing, lying, etc.&nbsp;
just cuz we are sober doesn't mean we are cured.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Obviously. I can see that.
</font><p>

nor just cuz we
work the steps or pray does it mean God will remove anything.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Bill Wilson says differently. In the <i>Big Book</i>, he says that God
will just remove the desire to drink alcohol,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">just lift it right out of us</a>.<br>
Do you always refute the teachings of Bill Wilson, or are you just doing it
for my benefit?
</font><p>


i believe
in God more than AA.&nbsp; bill wilson doesn't shy away from &quot;God&quot; in the
big book, so if your new comers read, they would see what the &quot;program&quot;
offers and know if it is for them or not.&nbsp; so go if it's not, try
something else then.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Gee, that sounds so nice and liberal and easy-going. It would be, if you 
hadn't already revealed that you really like using parole officers and judges to
force people into your groups, to <i><b>&quot;make them get help&quot;</b></i>,
as you called it.
Those victims
of your coercive recruiting schemes are not free to leave and go try something
else, are they?
<p>
Have you written a letter to the judge yet, telling him that you believe in
Freedom of Religion, so you do not want him to force any
more people to go to A.A. meetings?
</font><p>
<a name="mere_facts"> </a>
<a name="move_on"> </a>
it's a &quot;program&quot; that i believe in.&nbsp; it
has a good purpose and it fits with my beliefs in God.&nbsp; if it doesn't
fit with others, oh well, move on.&nbsp;
don't bash something that works
for so many people.&nbsp; those stats you gave do not correlate with my
experiences in AA groups.&nbsp; there is so many remaining sober for 10-40
years that i am around that it works in my experience.&nbsp; to hell with
stats!
<p>

<p><font color="blue">
Well, now we are getting down to it, aren't we? You won't let your opinions
be swayed by mere facts, will you?<br>
Not even facts
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">written by the A.A. General Service Office</a>.<br>
Not even facts written by one of the members of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. &#8212; Professor and Doctor George E. Vaillant of
Harvard University.<br>
Have you even read
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">what Prof. Vaillant wrote</a>,
or are you determined to stay ignorant for your whole life?
<p>
By the way, the fact that some people have been in the cult for 30 or 40
years does not prove that A.A. made them quit drinking or kept them sober.
All it proves is that they have been going to meetings for a lot of years.
You routinely see cause-and-effect relationships where none exist.

<p>
And again, you are contradicting yourself. You have repeatedly said that A.A.
did not make you quit drinking, God did,
and then you point to a few old-timers and say that
they prove to you that the program works.<br>
If A.A. didn't make you quit drinking, then how do you know that A.A. made those
other people quit drinking?<br>
How do you know <i>what</i> made them quit drinking?
<p>
I can go over to the local Bingo parlor and find a bunch of old ladies with
20, 30, even 40 years of playing Bingo. That doesn't prove that the Bingo game
is keeping them alive (even if some of them insist that Bingo is their life, and
even if they really love the social circle that they find there).
</font><p>


this God thing is not like i sit on my butt waiting to be cured.&nbsp;
over and over in AA you must work for sobriety.&nbsp; do what ever it takes
to be sober.&nbsp; it doesn't mean God will do it for you.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
I like your attitude, but Bill Wilson says differently.
Are you going to refute everything in
the <i>Big Book</i>? Good for you if you are. Would you like to write
an essay on how Bill Wilson and the <i>Big Book</i> are full of bull?
</font><p>

<a name="atheist2"> </a>
working
for sobriety means changing our negative self defeating wanting to die
and cheat and steal and blame everyone else in our lives for the crap we
got ourselves into.&nbsp; by praying to &quot;god as we understand him&quot; &quot;catholic,
lutheran, Buddhist&quot; what ever that understanding is it helps. i believe
in the power of God.&nbsp; so if your atheist or agnostic friends don't
like it, leave!&nbsp; why bash something that works for some people.
<p>
<p><font color="blue">
Geez Louise. For the third time, there is no Buddhist God.
<p>
And, for the third time, the Twelve Steps do not allow just any old God.
It has to be a God who will 'Work the Steps' and do what the Steps say.
<p>
And for the third time, please quit accusing everyone who disagrees with you of
being an atheist.
<p>
And why bash it? Well, how about because it's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">a Big Lie</a> and hurts as many people
as it helps?
</font><p>

cults to me work for the devil or for evil.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
How would you know? How many have you been in, or even visited, or even studied?<br>
Have you even read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a> yet?
<p>
Besides, do you really imagine that an evil cult will tell you that it is
an evil cult?<br>
<font color="#BF0000"><i><b>No. It won't. They never do.</b></i><br></font>
Cults lie and tell you that they are wonderful organizations,
doing God's work, spreading unconditional love, hope, peace, serenity,
giving, praying, etc..
</font><p>

at no point do i feel evil or do i feel lead astray.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
How could you feel anything? You are so out of touch with your feelings
that you say you don't even feel any shame or guilt while you do your
Fourth and Fifth Steps and list and confess every sin and crime you

we do not govern we are helpful members
giving back what we were so freely given.
<p><font color="blue">
Yes, recruiting for the cult.
</font><p>

<p>
churches have &quot;programs&quot; and &quot;beliefs&quot;, there are so many &quot;programs&quot;
which have guidelines, beliefs, rules, steps, are they all cults?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
No. You still haven't read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a> yet, have you? &#8212;Or you would
know the answer to that question.<br>
You keep on talking about cults, but you stubbornly refuse to learn anything
about them...
</font><p>

anything with specific steps just doesn't mean &quot;cult&quot;.&nbsp; it depends
on it's over all effects and purpose.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
You still don't know what you are talking about.
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Do some reading</a>.<br>
And whether a group is a cult or not <i>DOES NOT</i> depend
on its overall effects and purpose.<br>
Whether you understand it or not,
there can even be cults for a good purpose. The big problem is that they rarely
stay good. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
</font><p>

it's effects and purpose are
for the good of &quot;drunks&quot;&nbsp; true alcoholics, not people who can take
it or leave it.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
And also go read about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Professor George Vaillant's tests of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>
to find out its overall effects (which are not good).
You still haven't done that, either, have you?

<p>
And the &quot;purpose&quot; is irrelevant. What A.A. actually does is what matters.
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.
</font><p>

it's not for the hard drinker or moderate drinker.&nbsp;
aa is for the alcoholic types.&nbsp; if your not one you will never understand
because you are obviously not one.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
There you go again. If I don't approve of your nonsense, then I'm not &quot;a real

&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank"><i>Only another cult member understands.</i></a>&quot;<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
You really are doing a good job of demonstrating that A.A. is a cult.
</font>
</font><p>

it's not separating between people
due to &quot;cult&quot; crap it's a fact i drink different than other people without
the disease.&nbsp; do you understand wanting a drink so bad yet the denial
is so strong it lies to you and tells you it's okay even though you drink
till you over dose on alcohol and end up in ER or detox with the worse
case of delirium tremens.&nbsp; do you understand that?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, <a href="orange-addmonst.html#monster_we" target="_blank">I understand</a>.

do you understand
the complete obsession to drink inspite of consequences?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Yes, I understand.
<p>
Do you understand that you are mixing apples and oranges again?<br>
No matter how bad alcoholism is, it does not prove that Alcoholics Anonymous
is a good organization.
</font><p>

insane to
think we can over and over and over again while alcohol proves over and
over and over again it wants to kill us.&nbsp; call it evil vs good.&nbsp;
call it what ever you want.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
You are anthropomorphizing alcohol, which is a common Alcoholics Anonymous mistake.<br>
Alcohol does not want to kill you.<br>
Alcohol does not want to do anything.<br>
Alcohol has no will.<br>
Alcohol has no brain.<br>
Ethyl alcohol is just a clear liquid, a flammable hydrocarbon solvent,
with no more brains or will than a can of gasoline.
<p>
It is you who wants to drink alcohol because it makes you feel good.<br>
It is all a matter of what you want, not what alcohol wants.
<p>
That is a prime example of the kind of misinformation about alcoholism that
Alcoholics Anonymous spreads. That is just like Bill Wilson's statement that
alcohol is cunning, baffling, and powerful. (See the <i>Big Book</i>, bottom of
page 58.)<br>
That sounds like a fun subject for a B-grade horror movie,
but it isn't true.
<p>
<font color="green">
(Imagine a movie like &quot;The Slayer Solvent That Attacked Hollywood&quot;
&#8212; it hides in the back alleys and skulks around in the dark
and ambushes unwary pedestrians,
especially pretty young women who are alone.
It is cunning, baffling, and powerful! It wants to kill you!)

i need others who do understand what
i am going through.&nbsp; i don't go to a group counselling session for
divorce if i just lost a child to cancer.&nbsp; the divorced group just
wouldn't understand what the heck i'm talking about now would they.&nbsp;
you go where the people understand what exactly you go through.&nbsp; alcoholism
itself never claimed to be something people can understand if it did we'd
have a cure for it now wouldn't we.&nbsp; what exactly do you suggest people
do.&nbsp; just quit and move on?&nbsp; well, that is not possible for some
people.&nbsp; we live with drinkers, we have friends who call and temp
us, we live in drug house neighborhoods.&nbsp; it's all around us.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Now you are talking about Alcoholics Anonymous as a social club.<br>
The fact that you like A.A. as a social club does not prove that the
12-step religion is a good thing, or that it
has good effects, or that &quot;A.A. works&quot;, or that any of the Alcoholics
Anonymous dogma or doctrines are correct.
</font><p>

it's hard at first when you don't even trust yourself enough to stay sober.&nbsp;
we need&nbsp; a positive influence to and a group who doesn't drink to
combat all the temptation around us.&nbsp; what is wrong with that.&nbsp;
if i had my old using friends over and hung&nbsp; out with them then what's
the point of stopping drinking if my life remains the same in other respects?&nbsp;
crazy!&nbsp; eventually i'll drink it will temp me back into destroying
my life.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Now you are displaying the fears that they implanted in you. One of the standard
cult practices is
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank"><i>Phobia Induction</i></a>
&#8212; implant fears and phobias in the cult
members, and make them afraid to leave the cult:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>&quot;You will lose your ticket to Heaven, and you will go to Hell, if you
leave the group.&quot;</i><br></font>
A.A. teaches that you will relapse and die drunk if you leave the group.<br>
You probably don't even remember when they did it, do you? It was 12 or 13 years ago,
when you were a beginner, that they implanted that belief in you.

<p>
But you are forgetting that you did leave the cult. You already said that you
quit A.A. for a whole year, and you didn't relapse or die drunk, did you?
You handled it just fine.
All that happened was that you felt
lonely and depressed, so you went back to A.A. to get another shot of your
new favorite drug &#8212; A.A..
</font><p>


people gravitate to people who have the same goals, beliefs,
etc.&nbsp; so that is what i do.&nbsp; i make new friends and with people
i feel have my same beliefs and goals.&nbsp; this is a normal function
in life.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
That sounds okay. You are still just talking about a social club.
If you dump the cult religion, Bill Wilson, the Twelve Steps, the <i>Big Book</i>,
the official A.A. dogma, the misinformation about alcoholism,
the hundreds of thought-stopping clich&eacute;s and slogans, the
deceptive recruiting routines, and the coercive recruiting schemes,
then A.A. might be an okay social club.
</font><p>

so if you don't like what AA's about i suggest you look
elsewhere.&nbsp;

<a name="hidden_agenda"> </a>
you sound like you have a hidden agenda a resentment towards

You did read

You did read the bottom of

I have explained precisely why I feel that I have to tell the truth about Alcoholics

and
<a href="orange-letters3.html#agenda" target="_blank">on the table for all to see</a>.
It is Alcoholics Anonymous that has a hidden
agenda:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>&quot;Let us help you recover from alcoholism. No, on second thought,
let's addict you to our cult religion. <b>Our real purpose</b> is to fit
ourselves to be of maximum service to God....&quot;</i></font>
</font>
<p>

so why not let us be and do
what we want to do by being in aa, and you start your own &quot;recovery program&quot;
with your beliefs and have all those other people join with you.&nbsp;
i think you'll find that once your group becomes large enough and your
preaching your beliefs it will be started by you and be of your beliefs
just like when bill started it.&nbsp; it starts by a person and what that
person believes.&nbsp; if you don't like it or believe the same way move
on.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
How cute. You can't stand to hear the truth so you tell me to move on.
You ignore the fact that it is your organization that is forcing itself
on complete strangers, using the police, judges, parole officers, therapists,
and counselors to coerce more people into your cult. And then you want the critics
to just go away and quit bothering you.
<p>
Heck, <i>you</i> go away and quit bothering those of us who want to recover
without crazy cult religion.
And also quit spreading your misinformation about alcoholism.

</font><p>


same with a group you'd start, maybe others would come to your
group and think your running a cult and don't want any part of it.&nbsp;
a &quot;group&quot; has goals, beliefs, purpose, etc.&nbsp; you can't get around
that, and it's usually of the people who started it are passing on their
findings.&nbsp; this is why it's america!&nbsp; you can do what you want,
go where you want, believe what you want, yet you must respect others beliefs
and let them live their own lives.&nbsp; so you live your life and i'll
live mine.&nbsp; i don't push this on others, why then do you by forming
a website &quot;agent orange&quot;.&nbsp; your pushing your beliefs, goals, values,
and bashing others to put yourself up.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Cute trick. You are trying to
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial" target="_blank">reverse reality</a>.
That's the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#blame_victim" target="_blank">Blame the Victim</a>&quot;.
It is you who is using the criminal justice and health care systems to
force your cult on other people,
and then you claim that I'm forcing my opinions on others by writing some
pages and putting them up on a web site? Definitely cute.<br>
Well, my web site doesn't have a gun, but the police do.<br>
Who twisted your arm and forced you to visit my web site?<br>
What
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">judge sentenced you</a> to come here?
</font><p>

so get off the &quot;cult&quot; thing
all groups have &quot;cult&quot; looking structures.

<p><font color="blue">
Wrong. Totally wrong. You still haven't read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>, have you? You still don't know
beans about cults.
</font><p>


groups are not all cult's
just cuz they have beliefs, etc.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
True.
</font><p>

it's the purpose whether it be negative
or positive that makes it a &quot;cult&quot;.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Wrong, totally wrong. Go read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>.
</font><p>

aa is for the good whether you like it or not.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
For the good? That's more bad logic.
Being &quot;for the good&quot;, or claiming to have a positive purpose,
does not make something good.
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.
We have already talked about this, just a little while ago.
</font><p>

your good is defined different than mine, but it
doesn't make mine or aa a cult or bad just cuz you think it does.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Our definitions of good and bad are different? Perhaps.<br>

I think that it is very bad to lie to people in life or death matters 
where their lives are really on the line.<br>
<p>
Do you think that it is okay to do that to people?<br>
<p>
Apparently so, because earlier, you told us how you practice deceptive recruiting,
and don't tell the newcomers about the God part of the program, because you
know that they will leave and not come back if you tell them the truth...
I consider that evil. What do you call it?

</font><p>

that's your opinion it doesn't make your opinion reality to all.&nbsp;
it's like reading a psychology book about all the disorders out there.&nbsp;
if you read it you start thinking, hummm, i do that, i do that, ahhh i
wonder if i'm manic depressive, etc.&nbsp; everyone displays characteristics
of a disorder, but it doesn't mean we have it.&nbsp; so just cuz aa looks
like a &quot;cult to you doesn't mean it is.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
But if I accumulate a few hundred pages of evidence that it is an
evil deceptive cult, then it just might really be an evil deceptive cult.<br>
If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it just might
really be a duck.
</font><p>

it may have a organized system
of doing things and that's why you think it's a cult.&nbsp; it has beliefs
it follows well so does church and religions, political parties, unions,
companies, etc. pick on them then!&nbsp; groups all look like cults because
of it's structures, but that doesn't mean all groups are cults.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Wrong again. PLEASE go read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>,
just so that you will have some idea of what a cult actually is, and won't say
so many ignorant things.
</font><p>

again
i believe it's it's purpose evil or good that makes it a cult.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
As usual, wrong again. Believe it or not, some cults, like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="_blank">Synanon</a>, were started with the
best of intentions, for good purposes, like as drug and alcohol rehab programs.
</font><p>

my
experience around the tables has been of hope, purpose, love, kindness,
giving, sharing, struggling through divorces, deaths, etc. people helping
people with &quot;God&quot; not being hidden under the table.&nbsp; it is express
openly that is our beliefs as a group.&nbsp; so if the new comer doesn't
like it then leave and find your miracle elsewhere.&nbsp; more power to
yah!
<p><font color="blue">
Unless they are sentenced to A.A. meetings by your friends and associates,
of course. Then they can't leave or get away from your odd-ball religious beliefs.

</font><p>


<p>tell me what does work then huh?&nbsp; what is your theory of recovery
from this hideous disease that tempts many everyday to come back to it.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
That is very simple: Quit and stay quit.
<p>
Oh, and if you want to preserve your sanity, also avoid cult religions.
<p>
You might also want to try my simple Four-Step program:
<p>
<font size="+1">
<ul>
<li> 1. I admit that drinking and smoking has gotten to be a
real drag, and I am suffering so much that it isn't any fun any more.
<p>
<li> 2. I quit, and I'm staying quit forever.
<p>
<li> 3. Some of my friends may help me occasionally, but I'm mainly
going to count on myself.
<p> 
<li> 4. Whenever I am tempted to relapse, I will think
about step one again, and remember 
why I quit in the first place. I will also remember what
happened the last time I relapsed.
<p>
</ul>
</font>
</font>

how do you think a person should combat the most evil bad temptation to
destroy themselves.&nbsp; how do you think a person should DT and when
they do when it's still in them, how do you suggest they stop craving more
alcohol while it's in them.&nbsp; hummm what is your cure?&nbsp; instead
of bashing something that works for many as i see everyday.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Go read <a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
I've already written it all down.
</font><p>

why don't
you focus on the solution rather than what you think is a problem.&nbsp;
if you have no answer yourself then shut up!&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Oh, I have an answer. It is very simple.
It is:<br>
1) Quit drinking and stay quit. (Done)<br>
2) Tell the truth about A.A., to stop it from hurting people. (Work In Progress)<br>
</font><p>

it's disgusting how
you pick aa apart like you have an agenda or a hidden resentment to destroy
it.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
<a href="orange-letters3.html#agenda" target="_blank">Yes, I have an agenda</a>.
After seeing what A.A. is, I want to warn my friends
about it, as well as anyone else who may be harmed by it. I also want to put a
stop to A.A.'s deceptive and coercive recruiting practices.
</font><p>


who are you any ways?&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Really now. Have you no respect for the Eleventh Tradition? Don't you know
what the word &quot;anonymous&quot; means?
</font><p>

what authority do you have?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
I have the same authority as any other American citizen:
It is called Freedom of Speech.
</font><p>

what education do you have?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
Obviously, a whole lot more than you, because you have great difficulty with just
reading and writing simple English. I've politely avoided mentioning it up to now,
but since you brought up the subject of education, I suggest that you go get some
&#8212; especially English Composition.
</font><p>

what do you do for a living?&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
I'm a Tic-Tac-Toe International Grandmaster.
</font><p>

what makes you so concerned for people in aa?&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
I have friends in recovery.
<p>
By the way,
you are now giving us a good example of the propaganda and debating technique
called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#personal" target="_blank"><i>Ad Hominem</i></a>,
which is &quot;If you can't refute the message, then
attack the messenger. Try to find fault with the speaker.&quot;
</font><p>


the statements you put in
these emails have such loop holes to match them up against my experiences
they just don't match up.&nbsp; they are wrong in my eyes.&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
You don't know what you have seen. Just because you see a dozen or two people
in a room who have quit drinking does not prove that the Twelve Steps made them
quit drinking, or that A.A. made them quit drinking.<br>
You don't know what the cause is.<br>
In fact, you have repeatedly said that God, not A.A. or the Twelve
Steps, made you quit drinking. So you don't really have any evidence that
A.A. works, do you?
<p>
Besides, you are deliberately blinding yourself, and only seeing what you want
to see.<br>
As I asked you earlier:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
In your 13 years in A.A.,
how many thousands of people have you seen come
to A.A. looking for help, and then quickly leave because they were disgusted or appalled by
what they saw?<br>
How many died after getting the standard A.A. miseducation?<br>
How many just went out and died drunk in spite of A.A.?<br>
What do you have left? A few dozen out of thousands?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Is that what you call <font color="#BF0000">success</font>?<br>

That's what I call a failed program.<br>
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
And you know all of that.<br>
You can't not know it.<br>
You have eyes that work.<br>
You can see all of those people coming and then leaving.<br>
It is physically impossible for you to not see and know what is happening in A.A..<br>
You are <i>in denial</i> of what is in front of your face.
</font>
<p>
Actually, on one level of your mind, you know exactly what is going on,
because you already told us how you lie to the newcomers, and don't tell them
the truth about the program, because you know that they will leave and not
come back if you tell them the truth.
<p>
So you really do know about the Alcoholics Anonymous Revolving Door problem.

</font><p>


i have
an opinion and right to my beliefs etc.
<p><font color="blue">
Yes, but you do not have the right to use the justice system or the health care system
to force those beliefs on other people.
</font><p>

doesn't make you wrong it just
makes me chose another way.&nbsp; &quot;free will&quot;&nbsp; to believe and do what
we think is right for ourselves.&nbsp; &quot;victims&quot; we are not victims of
anyone or anything

<p><font color="blue">
Good, now you are beginning to get the idea.<br>
You are not a victim.<br>
You are not even the victim of
a disease called alcoholism, or of alcohol, which you imagine is cunning,
baffling, powerful, and wants to kill you.<br>
I mean that. You are not a victim of any of that stuff.<br>
There is no such disease as alcoholism, and alcohol has no will or desires, or even
any mind of its own.<br>
Alcohol doesn't want to kill you.<br>
Alcohol doesn't even know that you exist.
<p>
There is
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">only you, wanting to feel good</a>.<br>
Learn to deal with that, and you are home free.<br>
</font><p>

we have a mind of our own to pick and chose what is
right for ourselves, so stop act like the people you talk to are powerless
victims.&nbsp; they are not prisoners in aa, tell them to move on, that
if it isn't what they want find something else.&nbsp; if it works for others
let it go.&nbsp; we don't have to bash, ridicule, accuse, blame, etc. someone
else's beliefs.&nbsp;
<p><font color="blue">
Well actually, we do, when that &quot;someone else&quot;
is conspiring to use the justice system
to cram his or her religious beliefs down other people's unwilling throats.
</font><p>

&quot;freedom&quot; is wonderful and we all have it, so move
on to what works for you then, more power to yah!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><font color="blue">
No, actually, we don't all have freedom. Ever heard of jails and prisons?<br>
And guess where Alcoholics Anonymous loves to proselytize and recruit?
<p>
And I guess that &quot;move on&quot; remark is supposed to mean
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Shut up and
quit talking; quit saying things that I don't want to hear.&quot;</font><br>
(And maybe also
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Erase your web site.&quot;</font>)<br>
I don't need to &quot;move on&quot; to something that works, because I already
have something that works. It's called<br>
<center>
<font size="+2" color="#9F0000">
&quot;Do It Yourself.&quot;<br>
</font>
</center>
<p>
I now have 2 years of sobriety, all done without
Bill Wilson, Frank Buchman, the 12 Steps, or Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. Thanks for writing.
You have done quite a remarkable job of revealing the mind of an A.A. member.
