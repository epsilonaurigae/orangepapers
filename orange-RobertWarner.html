<hr size="4">

<p></p>
<p><font size="2">(All quotations from official A.A. 
literature)</p></font>
<p>Upon entering the program, you are presented with the Twelve Steps, 
and told that no one is going
to try to change your religion. After all, A.A. is not religious. 
What you are not told is that once
you begin working the program, each step evolves into a religious 
exercise matching or surpassing its religious wording.

<p>
The first step is a prime example:

<p><b><u>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212; that our lives 
had become unmanageable</u></b>

<p>A.A. presents to the novice only a seemingly simple
statement &#8212; admit you are powerless over
alcohol. Not a big red flag &#8212; any normal person assumes that
this means to seek counselling... But
Step One is changed, as the program progresses, to an explicitly
religious exercise, A.A. slowly
revealing its religious nature. What begins as a simple recognition 
&quot;<b>That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own
lives</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>13</sup></font> 
evolves, by Step Seven, into an effort to &quot;<b>to seek and
do God's will</b>&quot;.

This is achieved through actually changing the 
instructions of Step one after several steps have been worked.

<p>Throughout the steps, the words &quot;humility&quot; and
&quot;humble&quot; are sprinkled.
The common idea of what &quot;humility&quot; and &quot;humble&quot; mean,
is that you don't feel that you are better than other people &#8212; that all
are innately equal. This however, is not what A.A. defines as humble.
In A.A.,
&quot;<b>That basic ingredient of all humility</b>&quot; is
&quot;<b>a desire to seek and do God's
will</b>&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup>47</sup></font>

This &quot;desire to seek and do God's will&quot; is specified by A.A.
as &quot;<b>a necessity</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>48</sup></font>
to work Step One.
This is made clear only when A.A. feels they have a foothold in the
members mind.
What was a program of &quot;suggestions&quot; becomes one of
&quot;necessities&quot;.

<p>
While claiming that the only requirement in A.A. is the desire to 
stop drinking, A.A. fails to mention that there are other necessities. 
<br>
&quot;<b>Every newcomer in Alcoholics Anonymous is told, and soon
realizes for himself, that his humble admission of powerlessness over
alcohol is his first step toward liberation from its paralyzing grip.
So it is that we first see humility as a necessity</b>&quot;
<font size="-1"><sup>48</sup></font>


<p>
A.A. claims to be non-religious even while declaring that
&quot;<b>the attainment of greater humility</b>&quot; &#8212;
the &quot;desire to seek and do God's will&quot; &#8212;
&quot;<b>is the foundation principal of each of A.A.'s Twelve Steps.
For without some degree of humility,</b>
(again &quot;the desire to seek and do gods will&quot;)
&quot;<b>no alcoholic can stay sober at all</b>.&quot;

<p>
This is the same &quot;honesty&quot; that A.A. applies to Step Two.</p>


<p><b><u>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could 
restore us to sanity.</p></b></u>

<p>A.A. declares to the atheist that this can be anything the 
individual wishes it to be.
<br>

&quot;<b>You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your
'higher power</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>28</sup></font>

<br>
However, in the same breath, A.A. concludes that they mean God:

<br>
&quot;<b>...it was impossible for any of us to fully 
define or comprehend that Power, which is
God</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>5</sup></font>
<br>
Of course, when confronted, A.A. points 
elsewhere in the Steps to the
qualification&quot;<b>...God as we understood Him.</b>&quot;

<p>
It isn't until Step Twelve that you are informed that
A.A. is intended to help you become
&quot;<b>increasingly better able to understand
Him</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>54</sup></font>


<p>A.A. makes clear the reasons for the use of the term &quot;...as you 
understand Him...&quot; when they give instructions on how to approach the
prospective member, 
<br>
&quot;<b>If the man be agnostic or atheist, make it emphatic that he does 
not have to agree with your conception of God ... The
main thing is that he be willing to believe in a Power greater than 
himself... use everyday language to describe spiritual principals.
There is no use arousing any prejudice he may have against certain
theological terms and conceptions about which he may 
already be confused.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>18</sup></font>
<p>
Again, A.A. terms atheism as confusion and a failure in logic, and 
directs the recruiters to hide A.A.'s religiosity.
Step Twelve makes clear the reasons why A.A. allows the use of anything 
we wish as our higher power:
<br>
&quot;<b>From great
number of such experiences, we could predict ... the doubter ... who 
still considered his well-loved A.A. the higher power, would
presently love God and call Him by
name.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>54</sup></font>

<p>
Atheists are not members, they are projects.

<p>
While claiming the atheist can work Step Two, A.A. clarifies their 
attitude towards the atheist.
<br>

&quot;<b>Let's look first at 
the case of the one who says he won't believe &#8212; the belligerent one. 
He is in a state of mind which can be described only as
savage.&quot;</b><font size="-1"><sup>27</sup></font>
<p>
&quot;<b>We atheists ... believed...
that our human intelligence is the last word ... Rather vain of us, 
wasn't it?</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>7</sup></font>

<p>
The only use for atheism is as a target of attack.
The phrase &quot;as we understand Him&quot; is only meant to facilitate
that attack and to destroy any such heresy.

<p>
<b>&quot;A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest 
for faith... many..solve the problem by ... substitution ... make A.A. 
itself your higher power...
You find many members who have crossed the threshold just this way ... 
once across, their faith broadened and deepened... they came
to believe in a Higher Power, 
and most of them began to talk of
God.&quot;</b><font size="-1"><sup>29</sup></font>
<p>
&quot;As we understand Him&quot; is designed to convince the
atheist to pray in
hopes of getting him to talk of God.

<p>
But that is later. At this point in the program, A.A. has only 
convinced the new member to accept the AA group as his higher power.

Now, A.A. constructs a bridge to bring the member to God as
the higher power. Step Three is where A.A. begins to admit to 
its true nature.

While A.A. declares that &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Higher Power&quot;
are open to
interpretation, the program requires these conceptions of God
and Higher Power to be discarded after a certain point.


<p><b><u>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the 
care of God as we understood Him.</b></u>

<p>In Step Three of the Step Book, A.A. characterizes the concept of 
using A.A. as the Higher Power as an unacceptable aloneness.

<b>&quot;He made a beginning, we have seen, when he
commenced to rely upon A.A. for the solution to his alcohol problem. 
By now, though... he has become convinced that he has more problems
than alcohol... His lone courage and unaided will cannot do it.
Surely he must now depend upon Somebody or Something
else.&quot;</b><font size="-1"><sup>31</sup></font>
<p>
This is A.A.'s bridge. A.A. has allowed the use of the A.A. group as 
a transition to relying on &quot;Somebody or Something else&quot;.

At this point, A.A. tortures the English language to show the
member that the Steps he has already worked were actually religion, 
hence he has already acted religiously.

Therefor, he should have no problem in turning his will and
his life over to God.

A.A. describes itself as &quot;Providence.&quot;


<p>A.A. declares that
<b> &quot;Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends
to stick has, without realizing it, made a beginning on Step Three... 
each of them has decided to turn his or her will over to ...
Alcoholics Anonymous... a willingness has been achieved to cast
out ones own will ... and ... ideas ... in favor of... A.A....

Any willing newcomer feels that A.A. is the only safe harbor...

Now if this is not turning ones own will and life over to a
newfound Providence, what is
it?&quot;</b><font size="-1"><sup>30</sup></font>
<p>
A.A. does not intend the member to realize the effect the program
is having on him &#8212; they admit this happens without the member
realizing it.


<p>Having brought the member as far as Step Three, an acceptance
of God has been installed in the members psyche.
<ul>
<li> First, he admitted powerlessness over alcohol. 
A.A. then begins to inextricably weave their religious brand
of &quot;humility&quot; into steps being worked, about to be worked, and
already worked.
<li> Second, the member is given a definition of &quot;Higher Power&quot;
which, he is told, can be worked without religion &#8212; the A.A.
group.

Almost immediately after he has committed to allegiance to this
&quot;Higher Power&quot;, A.A. leads him away from a non-religious power
towards &quot;Somebody or Something else&quot;.

<li> Third, this is defined as &quot;God&quot;.
</ul>
For now, this &quot;God&quot;
is left undefined so A.A. can still use the qualification that this can 
be anything you choose &#8212; even
the A.A. group. Step Four begins the process of creating a working, 
verbal relation with
God.</p>


<p>Steps Four through Seven create for the member a subservient
god-consciousness, functioning together to eliminate all but literal
interpretations of God. It is here that we learn that the
&quot;<b>... foundation principal of each of A.A.'s Twelve
Steps...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>46</sup></font>

is a
&quot;... <b>desire to seek and do God's
will..</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>47</sup></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> It is here that we learn that our own conception of God is
insufficient, that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_deceived">we must have someone
else's approval</a> before utilizing
what God &quot;as we understand Him&quot; has told us.

<li> It is here that we find out that atheists who strive for
a self-determined 
objective are &quot;boys&quot; while
Christians who strive for an objective &quot;which is of God&quot; are men.

<li> Here we see that the point of A.A. is that
&quot;<b>The notion that we would still live our own lives, God helping
a little now and then, began to evaporate ... now the words 'Of myself
I am nothing, the Father doeth the works' began to carry ...
meaning.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>49</sup></font>

<li> It is here we find that A.A. intends us to &quot;change&quot; to where we
&quot;<b>move ... toward God</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>50</sup></font>

Until now, A.A. stressed that their program can be worked by an
atheist, that &quot;higher power' and &quot;God&quot; can be any thing we choose. 
Here, A.A. stops offering any way to marry its philosophy with atheism.


<p>
<blockquote>
&quot; <b>'I simply couldn't stop drinking, and no human being
could seem to do the 
job for me. But when I became willing to clean house and then
asked a Higher Power, God 
as I understood Him, to give me release, my obsession to drink
vanished. It was lifted right out of me...'
<p>

In A.A. meetings all over the world, statements just like this are heard daily...

It is plain... to see that each sober A.A. member has been
granted a release from this ... potentially fatal obsession.

So in a very complete and literal way, all A.A.'s have 'become
entirely ready'
to have God remove the mania for alcohol from their lives. And God has 
proceeded to do exactly that.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>42</sup></font>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<p>
This is the crucial difference between what A.A. 
claims to be and what A.A. really
is. Publicly, A.A. declares God is not meant literally; once the 
prospect is locked into the program,
they reveal that God is meant literally. They claim to believe the 
member gets cured with God's &#8212; any interpretation we wish &#8212; help.
What they really believe is that once we get ourselves close to
God, this super-natural being performs a miracle and removes
the &quot;illness&quot;.

<p>
In Step Four A.A. clarifies its perception of the cause and
cure of alcoholism.
To A.A., alcoholism is caused by distancing ourselves from God.

<p><b><u>4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of 
ourselves.</b></u>

<p>
A.A.'s &quot;moral inventory&quot; is put forth by A.A. as non-religious &#8212; in 
reality it is an exploration of how far &quot;we depart from... God&quot;.
<p>
&quot;<b>Alcoholics ... should be able to see that
instinct run wild in themselves is the underlying cause of their 
destructive drinking.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>33</sup></font>
<br>
&quot;<b>here... we have lost ... all genuine
humility</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>34</sup></font>
<br>
A.A. defines these &quot;instincts run wild&quot; as 
&quot;<b>the
point at which we depart from the degree of perfection that God wishes 
for us...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>43</sup></font>

The true philosophy of this step is only revealed slowly &#8212; it is
actually sinning that causes alcoholism.


<p>Step Four's &quot;moral inventory&quot; is defined as an
&quot;<b>effort to discover...
liabilities</b>&quot;,<font size="-1"><sup>32</sup></font>

these
&quot;liabilities&quot; defined as &quot;<b>misdirected instinct</b>&quot;.
As we continue through the program, A.A. slowly changes this to a problem of
&quot;<b>..lost..humility (a desire to seek and do God's
will)</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>34</sup></font>

and terms these &quot;<b>liabilities</b>&quot; as
&quot;<b>character defects</b>&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup>35</sup></font>

These &quot;character defects&quot; are then termed
&quot;<b>Sins</b>&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup>35</sup></font>

Finally, these &quot;sins&quot; are specified as
&quot;<b>the Seven Deadly
Sins</b>&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup>35</sup></font>

What is advertised by A.A. as a non-religious self-appraisal turns into
an exploration of how we have lost our 
&quot;<b>desire to seek and do God's
will</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>47</sup></font>
and committed the Seven Deadly Sins.
<p>
As we proceed through the next three steps, we see this religiosity
increase to the point of the exclusion of atheism.

<p>
Can &quot;God&quot; in A.A. be anything we choose? In Step Five that becomes 
impossible &#8212; the protestations of non-religiosity stop.
Here, God is a non-human entity that speaks to us.
We are specifically instructed that the words that come from inside ourselves 
are not good enough; only God's words can be trusted.
This step makes it impossible for God to be anything except a
supernatural being.
The prospect now has a choice; pray to a supernatural power or abandon the
program.
If he is under threat of imprisonment the choice is this; face the punishment
or bow down before a God he doesn't believe in.
<p>

&quot;<b>Many an A.A., once agnostic or atheistic, tells us that it
was during... Step Five that he first actually felt the presence of 
God</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>40</sup></font>

<br>
Of course it is; there is no way to continue in the program otherwise.

<p><b><u>5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being 
the exact nature of our wrongs.</b></u>

<p>In this step, we must seek God's counsel. After all,
&quot;<b>scarcely any Step is more
necessary to long time sobriety ... than this
one.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>37</sup></font>

In answer to the question
&quot;<b>Why don't we make our admissions to Him directly?
Why do we need to bring anyone else into
this?</b>&quot;,<font size="-1"><sup>38</sup></font>

A.A. instructs confessing to another person specifically as a way of
making sure we don't misinterpret God's words for us and as a way of 
confirming that we were honest with God. There is no other reason suggested.
In actuality, this is straight from the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance">Oxford Group theology of 
&quot;<b>checking
guidance</b>&quot;</a><font size="-1"><sup>20</sup></font>
&#8212; one of the group's &quot;Five Procedures&quot; central to their religion.
A.A. asks 
&quot;<b>How many times have we heard well-intentioned people claim the
guidance of God when it was all too plain that they were sorely
mistaken?</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>39</sup></font>

A.A. declares that 
&quot;<b><a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_deceived">what comes to
us alone may be garbled by our own
rationalizations</a>...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>39</sup></font>
<p>
Yet, if A.A. is not religious, and an atheist's religious philosophy is
not in conflict with A.A.'s religious doctrine, where does A.A.
believe an atheist's guidance comes from if they pray to God?


<p>
A.A. stresses that agnostics and atheists can work the program by 
adopting their own concept of God. Inherent in this position is that the answers 
actually come from within the person, since the atheist has no God. Step Five expressly 
advises against this;
confessing to another person is expressly defined as preventing us from 
acting on advice which comes from our own minds.
If an atheist asks another person to interpret his
conversation with God, then the atheist is obeying that other person's 
religious philosophy, rather than his own.
A.A. welcomes atheists into the program as long as they obtain approval of
their meditations from a person more experienced in communicating with God.
Once he has done this, maybe A.A. will consider him a &quot;man&quot;, as long as he 
works Step Six properly.

<p>
Having recognized our loss of humility as the source of our alcoholism, having
confessed our sins to God (as we understood Him, but approved by someone with more
experience in dealing with Him), we arrived at Step Six. Up to this point, we have been
presented with a series of steps which have been termed non-religious. 
At each step, we have been given ways, sensical or not, to meld
them to atheism.
<ul>
<li>
In Step One, a simple admission of powerlessness was mandated.
Later we find that this means that no human power could relieve alcoholism.
<li>
In Step Two, we were told to believe in a Power greater
than ourselves, but that the A.A. group would suffice.
<li>
But in Step Three, we find that what we actually did, in Step Two, was 
&quot;<b>without realizing it... decided to turn his
or her will over to a newfound
Providence...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>30</sup></font>

and to proceed any further, we
&quot;<b>...must now depend on Somebody or Something
else.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>37</sup></font>

We proceeded to make what is billed as a non-religious &quot;moral inventory&quot;
which evolves from a personal examination to a search for how we have committed the
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness">
&quot;<b>Seven Deadly Sins</b>&quot;</a><font size="-1"><sup>36</sup></font>

which caused us to lose the
&quot;<b>...desire to seek and do God's will</b>&quot;.

<li>
Now, in Step Five, we are told to non-religiously confess these
&quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; to &quot;God&quot;.
This is where we find out that although our own conception of
&quot;God&quot;
is sufficient to work the program, we need the approval of another person
to be sure that we're not wrong about our conception of God, because our
conception of God may be &quot;<b>garbled by our own
rationalization.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>39</sup></font>

<li>
It is in Steps Six and Seven that we find out why. A.A. makes clear 
that its objective is of God, and not a self-determined objective.
&quot;<b>This is the Step that separates the men from the
boys.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>41</sup></font>
</ul>

<p><b><u>6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these
defects of character.

<br>
<br>7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</u></b>

<p>
Step Four had introduced A.A. theories on &quot;instincts&quot;. 
&quot;<b>Creation gave us instincts
for a purpose... these desires ... are perfectly necessary and right, 
and surely, God-given.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>32</sup></font>

A.A. uses words interchangeably; desires and instincts are used in each
other's stead. In Step Six, this method is used to further explore
&quot;instincts&quot; as they relate to A.A. theory. To cure our
alcoholism, we must return to God's ideal for us, for we have drifted.

&quot;<b>... most of us are born with an abundance of natural desires...
when they drive us blindly, or we willfully demand that they supply us
with more... than ... due us, that is the point at which we depart from
the degree of perfection that God wishes for us here on earth. That is the 
measure of our character defects, or, if you wish, of our
sins.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>43</sup></font>

Step Six &quot;<b>is the exact point at which we abandon limited
objectives, and move towards God's will for
us.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>45</sup></font>

&quot;<b>So, the difference between 'the boys and the men' is
the difference between striving for a self determined objective
and for the perfect objective which is of
God</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>44</sup></font>

Step Seven effectively shuts the door in the atheists face. It is in
Step Seven, &quot;Humbly asked Him to remove 
our shortcomings&quot;, that A.A. reveals that its very foundation is a 
&quot;...<b>desire to seek and do God's will</b>...&quot;
<font size="-1"><sup>47</sup></font>

<p>
Step Seven &quot;<b>specifically concerns itself with
humility</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>46</sup></font>


&quot;<b>Indeed, attainment of greater humility is the foundation
principle of each of A.A.'s Twelve Steps... without... humility,
no alcoholic can stay sober at
all</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>46</sup></font>

To maintain humility in A.A. requires one
&quot;<b>basic ingredient... a desire to seek and do God's
will...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>47</sup></font>

<p>
This is how things change in A.A. as the program progresses &#8212; things
start out defined as nonreligious &#8212; humility &#8212; but are changed to require
religious actions &#8212; a desire to seek and do God's will.

<p><b><u>
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious
contact with God as
we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for
us and the power to carry that out.</p></b></u>

<p>In Step Eleven, all further debate about the existence of
God is to cease. 
&quot;<b>To... those one-time agnostics who still cling to the A.A.
group as their higher power, claims for the power of prayer may,
despite all the logic and experience in proof of it, still be quite
objectionable...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>51</sup></font>

<br>
&quot;<b>we recoiled from 
meditation and prayer as obstinately as the scientist who
refused to perform a certain experiment lest it prove his pet theory 
wrong. Of course we finally did experiment, and when unexpected results
followed, we felt different; in fact we knew different; and so we were
sold on meditation and
prayer...</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>52</sup></font>
<p>

Except for dealing with the occasional relapse of the convert back into
atheism, this is the end of atheism as far as A.A. is concerned.
After this, in Step Twelve, A.A. freely admits that the program is aimed
at converting the non-believer to believer, and the believer
to A.A. religion.

<p>

<p><b><u>
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps,
we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice
these principles in all our affairs.</p></b></u>

<p>

A.A. summarizes the indoctrination process in Step Twelve. 
&quot;<b>...in Step Three... we who were atheist... discovered... AA....
would suffice as a higher
power.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>53</sup></font>
<br>

&quot;<b>In Step Eleven... The persistent use of meditation
and prayer... did
open the channel so that where there had been a trickle, there was now
a river which led to sure power and safe guidance from God as we were
increasingly better able to understand
Him</b>.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>54</sup></font>

A.A. allows us to use our own conception of God, as we understand Him,
until it is able to teach us to better understand Him.

But what is the point of the whole program?

<p>

&quot;<b>So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question, ... we could predict that the doubter
who still claimed that he hadn't got the 'spiritual angle', and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power would presently love
God and call Him by name.</b>&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>54</sup></font>
<p>
And A.A. will still claim they are not religious.
And A.A. itself proves &#8212; explicitly &#8212; its own lie.

<p>
Is A.A. religious? As of this writing, I have been in court for 
over half of a decade, and it is still being claimed by A.A.
and my government that A.A. is not religious, that the program
is not a religious program.
<p>

This is not a mistake; it is a lie. The Big Book states on page XX
(in its Forward) that A.A. is not a religious organization.
It contradicts this premise &#8212; makes it a lie &#8212; in its
appendix (II) [page 569 of the third edition]:
<blockquote>
&quot;<b>The terms 'spiritual experience' and 'spiritual 
awakening' are used many times in this book which; upon careful
reading, shows that the personality change sufficient to
bring about recovery from alcoholism has manifested itself
among us in many different forms. 

Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the
impression that these personality changes, or religious
experiences, must be in the nature of sudden or spectacular upheavals.

Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous</b>.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>

A.A. writes explicitly that what they aim for are &quot;religious
experiences&quot; and they deny it. Their aim is to make us love
God and call him by name. Period.

<p>
When they report, to the government, attendance at these meetings,
designed to create religious experiences, they take this deceit to a
dangerous level.
<p>

They help government establish a state religion.
