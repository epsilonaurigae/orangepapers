<a name="ftnt033_ret"> </a>
Meanwhile, another crisis was brewing:
Buchman was losing his old friend Sam
Shoemaker, a fellow evangelical minister. The two of them had
been working closely together ever since meeting way
back in the early days, in 1918, in China, and Shoemaker
had acted as Buchman's right-hand man and
the American head of the Oxford Group movement
for more than 20 years.
But Shoemaker was increasingly finding that he
could not follow Buchman's lead any longer. He was alienated by
the new direction which MRA was taking. He felt that MRA was
turning into a religious sect in its own right, rather than being just a
spiritual adjunct to other churches, like the Oxford Group
Movement had claimed to be.
Shoemaker felt that MRA had chosen a path
which seemed more and more to
dissociate it from the Christian churches and a
New Testament orientation.
<p>
In other words, Frank Buchman had abandoned Christianity and was just making
up his own religion.

<p>
Sam Shoemaker was right &#8212; go re-read all of those 'principles' and
tenets and practices of Buchmanism again, and you will not see the words &quot;Jesus&quot;
or &quot;Christ&quot; in them anywhere.
The words &quot;Jesus&quot;, &quot;Christ&quot;, and
&quot;Christianity&quot; were used as decorations
in a few slogans and speeches, but Buchman's dedication to Christ seems to have been little more
than that. Buchman could, and did, switch from promoting &quot;Christianity&quot; to
promoting a non-Christian generic &quot;morality&quot; or &quot;spirituality&quot; with ease.

As one critic,
<a href="orange-Ironside.html" target="_blank">Rev. H. A. Ironside</a>, pointed out, all of the
tenets and practices of Buchmanism would still be possible
<a href="orange-Ironside.html#never_been_born" target="_blank">even if Jesus Christ
had never been born</a>.


<p>
In addition, Frank Buchman maintained that any Oxford Group member's current
Guidance and Confession was just as informative and as authoritative as the
stories in the Gospels, which implied that Buchman was assigning
himself a position equal to that of the Biblical saints and prophets, or even
Jesus Christ himself.<br>
<!---------------------------------------
<font color="blue">
(Curiously, that is also what Bill Wilson was later reported
to have come to
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Henrietta" target="_blank">think of
<i>himself</i></a>, too.)
</font>
------------------------>

<p>
Early on, the Oxford Groups and Moral Re-Armament had claimed to be only an extension
of Christianity, or a re-establishment of &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot;,
but it was really something of Frank Buchman's own invention &#8212;
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">something that was in many ways heretical</a>.
Sam Shoemaker explained,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When the Oxford Group was, on its own definition, a movement
of vital personal religion, working within the churches to make
the principles of the New Testament practical as a working force today
we fully identified ourselves with it,&quot; declared the Rev Shoemaker.
&quot;Certain policies and points of view, however, have arisen in the
development of Moral Re-Armament about which we have had increasing
misgivings.&quot;<br>

Movement and Moral Re-Armament</i>, Geoffrey Williamson, page 210.<br>

<p>
<a name="Islam"> </a>
The old talk of &quot;winning people to Christ&quot; was dropped.
MRA was now held out as something acceptable to people of any race or
creed.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt033">33</a></sup></font>
Where the Oxford Group had been more religious, MRA was more political.
Buchman even traveled to India, where he declared that MRA was quite
compatible with Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...MRA [Moral Rearmament or the Oxford Group] must, therefore,
be so projected in India that it would not seem to the most
devout Hindu or Moslem to be just another Christian mission.
So we find that in MRA propaganda designed for the oriental
market there is practically no mention of Christianity:
Christ, if named at all, is sandwiched unobtrusively between
Gautama the Buddha and Mahatma Ghandhi; the suggestion is
that, whatever your faith, you will be the better &#8212; a better
Hindu or Buddhist or Moslem &#8212; for accepting MRA's rule of life;
and this rule of life, so far as it is theistic at all, is
consistent ... with a relatively undogmatic pantheism.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Mystery of Moral Re-Armament; A Study of
Frank Buchman and His Movement</i>, Tom Driberg, 1965, page 163.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And Buchman...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...saw no inconsistency in saying that MRA had &quot;the answer ... that unites
the Moslem with all men who truly live their faith&quot; and that the
Moslem nations could be &quot;a girder of unity for the whole world,&quot;
while he was at the same time assuring his less broad-minded brethren in the
Ministerium of Pennsylvania that his teaching was based entirely on that of
Luther.<br>

<p>
Sam Shoemaker was not the only one to see Frank Buchman's divergence from
mainstream Christianity. In 1954, Geoffrey Williamson reported that:
<p>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In practice, campaigns waged since the second world war have been of a political character.
In place of &quot;patriotism,&quot; which served well enough for a motive
during the war years, the Buchmanites glibly turned to cries of &quot;an overarching ideology,&quot;
or a &quot;supernational ideology,&quot; or an &quot;ideology superior to Communism or any other -ism&quot;!
Or a &quot;united ideology of Inspired Democracy.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The old talk of &quot;winning people in Christ&quot; has been dropped. MRA is now held out as something
acceptable for people <i>of any race or creed.</i><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is not in my power to unravel all this. I am simply stating the facts as I found them.
In the bookshop at Mountain House I found a leaflet by Peter Howard entitled <i>The Press
in an Ideological Age</i>.
Here is an extract:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Times,Times Roman,Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We are living in an ideological age. This is big news. The battle is no longer
only for economic and social reform, for wages and profits; it is no longer a battle
for the control of territory or empire, but it is a battle
to decide what ideas will capture the hearts and mobilize the wills
of the masses, right across the world.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And in another leaflet by
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#William_Jaeger" target="newwin36" target="_blank">Bill Jaeger</a>,
called <i>How to Change a Marxist</i>, I found this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Times,Times Roman,Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If every Marxist can change a capitalist, and every capitalist can change
a Marxist, then we can change the world, and that is the programme of Moral Re-Armament.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And yet another, on <i>How to Change Capitalists</i>, by Garrett Stearly, contained this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Times,Times Roman,Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
How to change capitalists! Some people think it is a very difficult thing.
I had supper last night with a gentleman who has been in touch with
capitalists all  his life. He was very sceptical about whether they
could ever change. Yet it is not really very difficult. It is like elephant-hunting.
You have to make a lot of preparations, but when you meet an elephant,
and you know how to shoot, you can hit the target.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
During my stay at Caux I amassed a great collection of leaflets and pamphlets.
They were filled with the same sort of stuff. Thousands of words about &quot;ideology&quot;;
<i>but not one mention of &quot;the advancement of the Christian religion.&quot;</i><br>

<p>
Roy Livesey, an English author and former MRA member, reported the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It must be said that I look in vain in around one hundred Oxford Group and MRA publications
on my shelf and find little help to point the way to salvation....<br>

<p>
<a name="not_Christ_centered"> </a>
<a name="ftnt089_ret"> </a>
Many years later, when Frank Buchman died in 1961,
the President of the United Lutheran Church in America, Dr. Franklin Clark Fry,
criticized the MRA movement as &quot;not Christ-centered&quot; and said
of Buchman that his connection with the United Lutheran Church had
been &quot;only
minimal&quot;.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt089">89</a></sup></font>

While Frank Buchman was moving away from any specific talk about
Jesus Christ or Christianity, so was Bill Wilson.
Individual Alcoholics Anonymous members will still occasionally claim
that
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Bible_based" target="_blank">A.A. is &quot;Christian&quot;,
or &quot;based on the Bible&quot;</a>, but
Bill Wilson carefully avoided making any such claims. Rather, in 1938
he claimed that A.A.  was compatible with <i>any and all</i> religions.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those having religious affiliations will find nothing here disturbing
to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over
such matters.<br>

Chapter 2, <i>There Is A Solution</i>, page 28.<br>
Originally written in late 1938.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And like Frank Buchman, Bill Wilson claimed that his
program was quite acceptable to Buddhists. In his official
history of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill claimed that he
received this letter
from a Presbyterian minister who was doing missionary work
in the Far East:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We took A.A.'s Twelve Steps over to the largest Buddhist monastery
in this province. We showed them to the priest at the head of it.
After he had finished looking over the Twelve Steps, the monk said,
&quot;Why, these are fine! Since we as Buddhists don't understand
God just as you do, it might be slightly more acceptable if you
inserted the word 'good' in your Steps instead of 'God.' Nevertheless,
you say in these Steps that it is God <i>as you understand Him</i>.
That clears up the point for us. Yes, A.A.'s Twelve Steps will
certainly be accepted by the Buddhists around here.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson,
page 81.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But note how Bill had the Buddhist priest using Bill's usual wording,
&quot;...we as Buddhists <i>don't understand God</i>...&quot; Bill
routinely claimed
that anyone who disagreed with him about religious matters
didn't understand God, and was &quot;prejudiced&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-recruit.html#arousing_prejudice" target="_blank">confused about
theological terminology</a>&quot;...
<p>
It seems to me that the Buddhist priest would be more likely to say
that Buddhists do not believe in the existence of any supernatural
omnipotent being who will magically grant your wishes by pulling puppet strings
and changing reality to suit you. So Steps 2, 3, 7, and 11,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle" target="_blank">where the A.A. believers
demand miracles from God</a>,
cannot make much sense to Buddhists. If they weren't so polite, they
would laugh out loud at such childish Santa Clause spirituality.

<p>

There was also a problem with power politics, the gradual take-over of
the facilities of Shoemaker's church, Calvary House in New York, by MRA,
which MRA was using as its American national headquarters.
Through 1940 and 1941, Shoemaker tried to resolve these issues with
Buchman, but seems to have been ignored.  Finally, in the
closing months of 1941, Calvary Church asked MRA to vacate the
premises of Calvary House. And that was that.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Group were asked to cease using their national headquarters which
then formed part of the Calvary Episcopal Church in New York.
The request was all the more shattering because it came from the
Rev Samuel Shoemaker, one of Buchman's earliest American adherents.<br>

<font size="-1">

Movement and Moral Re-Armament</i>, Geoffrey Williamson, pages 209-210.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

But Sam Shoemaker stays in the story of A.A.:
he is the same minister as Bill Wilson mentions repeatedly in the
Big Book and in various A.A. history books. He is the same Rev. Shoemaker
as attended the 20th anniversary Alcoholics Anonymous convention.
Rev. Shoemaker was essentially Bill's minister, and the two grew
closer together for both having left, willingly or unwillingly,
Buchman's organization.

Less Buchmanism
</font>

<p>
Buchmanism's recent disastrous decline in both Britain and America was highlighted this month when it lost both its U.S. headquarters and its chief U.S. exponent. Rector Samuel Moor Shoemaker of Manhattan's Calvary Episcopal Church did this double job by ousting the cult from his parish house and declaring that

&quot;after careful thought and prayer&quot; he himself had quit the movement because of his &quot;increasing misgivings.&quot;
<p>

Dr. Shoemaker's misgivings are not the first that have been felt about tony Evangelist Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman, who has led a series of hit-&amp;-run house-party revivals, known successively as &quot;Buchmanism,&quot; &quot;A First Century Christian Fellowship,&quot; &quot;The Oxford Group&quot; and &quot;Moral Re-Armament (MRA).&quot; All have a free-&amp;-easy panacea, best summed up in MRA's California drive last year: &quot;You don't join anything, you don't pay anything, the idea is that you begin living the MRA standards.&quot;

<p>
One of these standards, &quot;absolute honesty,&quot; British Humorist A. P. Herbert hoisted with devastating effect in the House of Commons last month by quoting Frank Buchman's varying entries in Who's Who between 1928 and 1939. Sample Buchman claim he riddled: &quot;studied at Cambridge University 1921-22.&quot; That debate was a Waterloo for Buchmanism. Its 172 followers in Parliament (the fruit of two years' intensive lobbying) were all set to protest Labor Minister Ernest Bevin's refusal to exempt the Group's lay evangelists from military service. When Herbert and Bevin got through, not one of the 172 cared to reply.

<p>
Since then, secessions from the Group have landslided in Britain. Example: Sir Patrick Joseph Henry Hannon, industrialist, member of Parliament, ardent Group sympathizer. Last week Sir Patrick derided Buchmanite claims to have settled three impending work stoppages in the Midlands by urging Buchmanite principles on management and labor. Sir Patrick investigated, decided that the trouble had been cured by &quot;sordid means like better pay and better hours.&quot;

<p>
In the U.S. Evangelist Buchman is losing followers not only through this recent setback in Britain but because many Buchmanites, including Dr. Shoemaker, now believe that he wants to form an independent sect. He has abandoned his onetime claim that Buchmanism simply makes Baptists better Baptists, Catholics better Catholics, etc. Result: he is rapidly losing the active churchmen he had in his ranks, recruiting few new members from the churches.

<p>
One tip-off on the Group's tobogganing is that publicity-wise Groupers, who for years not only welcomed but pursued the press, have lately avoided reporters like the plague both in Britain and the U.S. Evangelist Buchman, who is now trying to convert Maine to MRA, last week dodged correspondents everywhere he went. MRA has had little luck in Maine since its advent there last June. The general Down East reaction to its smooth, eupeptic preachers: &quot;What's the catch?&quot;

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It was a race to remake the world, and Buchman lost.
Wherever MRA was strong, war's threat was stronger. Before December first,
peace was broken in England where MRA had been a morale-builder, a fostering
mother in the years of crisis. MRA's idealistic dream of &quot;bridges between
nations&quot; was being swept away. The strategist for souls saw Europe
breaking in his hands, while vicious rumors arose to taunt him.
Chamberlain, who had believed in MRA, was disgraced. He had trusted Hitler
too much. Out of the failure of the tragicomic Munich appeasement,
Buchman's words bounced back. What did he mean when he said, &quot;I thank
God for a man like Hitler&quot;? Secessions from the group reached landslide
proportions. Was he a Nazi sympathizer?<br>

The faithful Buchmanite Garth Lean had a ready explanation for Truman's defection:
Truman had to &quot;drop all connections with any other groups, however
worthwhile&quot; as a condition of getting the Vice Presidential nomination
in 1944, he says.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt084">84</a></sup></font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>(There is, of course, another likely explanation. When President Roosevelt's staffers
were vetting Senator Truman and carefully examining his past while
considering him as a possible Vice-Presidential candidate, they might have noticed that
Truman was far too chummy with a certain religious leader who was far too chummy
with high-ranking Nazis... And when they told Truman about the real background of his
Moral Re-Armament friends, he probably said something like, &quot;Oops!&quot;,
or some of those choice 4-letter words for which he was famous,
and immediately decided not to have anything more to do with those MRA guys...)</i>

<p>

<p><br>
And of course the Buchmanites minimized and denied Sam Shoemaker's defection.
They tried to explain away Sam's quitting the cult as merely a small
disagreement over territory and objectives:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Logan Roots, the retired Primate of China, now working full-time with
Buchman, gave his own explanation of this development. 'The simple
issue,' he said, 'is that Shoemaker has initiated a new parish policy
whereby he felt the parish was the prime objective. Buchman, true to
his twenty-year-old definition of the Oxford Group as a programme of
life issuing in personal, social, racial, national and supernational
change, felt the work could not be limited to the confines of a parish
but must give itself and its work to every parish and every denomination,
and that if the parish would rightly see it the Church could really
be a focal centre to save the world.'<br>

The MRA leader Garth Lean declared in his biography
<i>On the Tail of a Comet: The Life of Frank Buchman</i> that Sam Shoemaker
ultimately rejected Buchmanism because &quot;he didn't want to grow out
of his cocoon&quot;, rather than because Shoemaker felt that Buchman
was abandoning
Christianity.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt095" target="_blank">95</a></sup></font>
Lean also gave a rather paranoid explanation of the split &#8212;
It was caused by some
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;personal recriminations against Frank surfacing...&quot;.
</font>
(What recriminations?)

Then Lean wrote that Frank Buchman moved out of Calvary House not because
he had been ordered to by Rev. Shoemaker, but rather just because his doctor advised it.
Then Garth Lean cast Frank Buchman in a noble light, making him into a long-suffering
saint:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For Buchman the rupture was a personal sorrow. He had seen it coming,
as personal recriminations against him within the Calvary House community
had begun to surface during the spring. These difficulties caused
his health to deteriorate, and his doctor had him moved from
Calvary House into the country. 'His great concern', writes the doctor,
'was not his health but his friend... which caused him great agony
of spirit, yet without any word of bitterness or resentment.
One day I found him relaxed, and his face shone. It was apparent
something tremendous had happened to him. He said he had prayed all night
for his friend... &quot;I will live unity,&quot; he said to me.
&quot;Tell everyone that.&quot;'<br>
</font>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Frank Buchman also declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'They say there has been a split between us. Not a split, but there's always
been a splinter... I can't raise any feeling against him. My temperature
does not rise an inch.' To one friend in Calvary Church who wrote asking
whether he should cut his association with Shoemaker, Buchman replied
that he must certainly not do so, as Shoemaker would need his support more
than ever.<br>

<p>
That's so outrageously arrogant and sanctimonious that it is downright funny:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Now that Rev. Sam Shoemaker has finally seen through Frank Buchman's
phony game, Shoemaker will need the Buchmanites' help more than ever.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
It's also a textbook case of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Denial</i></a> and
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial" target="_blank"><i>Reversal of Reality</i></a>.

Also notice the narcissistic denial of feelings:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
'...something tremendous had happened to him. He said he had prayed all night
for his friend...&quot;I will live unity,&quot; he said to me. &quot;Tell everyone that.&quot;'<br>
&quot;I can't raise any feeling against him. My temperature
does not rise an inch.&quot;</font>
<p>
Narcissists simply cannot handle intense feelings
which might cause their facade of bliss, serenity, and tranquility to crack.
Dr. Alexander Lowen wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The need to project and maintain an image forces the person to prevent
any feeling from reaching consciousness that would conflict with the image.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The narcissist faces the risk of being overwhelmed by feelings and going wild,
crazy, or mad, should his defense of denial break down.
This is especially true of anger. Every narcissist is afraid of going
crazy, because the potential for insanity is in his personality. This
fear reinforces the denial of feeling, creating a vicious circle.<br>

<p>
And Frank Buchman continued to maintain that mask of serenity. Four pages later,
Garth Lean wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Despite the growing tensions over the question of the call-up Buchman
said at this time, 'I am living in a zone of calm.'<br>

Sam Shoemaker gets the credit for originating the
<i>&quot;Act As If&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;</i>
practice that is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#act_as_if" target="_blank">popular in Alcoholics Anonymous
and Narcotics Anonymous</a> circles. Note that Shoemaker invented that clever
persuasion technique to help in the religious conversion of doubtful
newcomers, not to help anyone to quit drinking or drugging:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font size="+2">&quot;Act As If&quot;</font><br>
In 1954, the Reverend Samuel M. Shoemaker wrote a story about an unfortunate
who came to him admitting that he didn't believe in God and certainly didn't
know how to pray. Shoemaker asked him to &quot;try an experiment,&quot;
<font color="#af0000">
as he had nothing
to lose</font>. He asked him to get down on his knees and say anything at all that
came to his mind, addressing his thoughts to &quot;The Unknown.&quot;
He then asked if the man could read just one chapter from the Bible,
from the book of John. Solely out of respect for Shoemaker, the man
obliged, but fighting every step of the way. This went on for some
time, until one day the man actually began praying to God and reading
the Bible and other works on his own. The man eventually became a spiritual
leader within his church. Shoemaker believed that this was possible because
the man &quot;acted as if he had faith&quot; until faith came by accident, or
&quot;until there was an opening for God to come through.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The slogan &quot;act as if&quot; has been used in AA circles ever since.<br>
<font size="-1"><i>A Ghost In The Closet: Is There An Alcoholic Hiding?</i>, Dale Mitchell, Page 194.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Shoemaker said that the man had &quot;nothing to lose.&quot; That was
not true at all.
(That is quite a rationalization for joining a cult religion.)
The man had a great deal to lose, starting with his
mind and his sanity, and perhaps also his soul and his life.
<p>
Note how Shoemaker cleverly got the man praying
to nothing but &quot;The Unknown&quot;, just to get him accustomed
to praying to something. (That is just like the A.A. technique of getting
reluctant skeptics
praying to a bedpan, a doorknob, or something as their &quot;Higher Power&quot;.)
But then <i>&quot;The Unknown&quot;</i> morphed into Sam Shoemaker's
version of &quot;God&quot;. A.A. uses
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#kind_of_God" target="_blank">the very same
bait-and-switch trick</a> today to effect the religious conversion of newcomers.
