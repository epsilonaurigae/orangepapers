Subject:  	I Started Reading....<br>

<p>
I read quite a bit of your stuff. I actually found this site 2 years ago, when I was
a newcomer to AA. I think that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, on pretty
much anything. But, you also have to remember, that I'm entitled to my opinion. If I
believe that AA has saved my life, it's not quite kosher to call me basically a
brain-washed dumb-ass. I have seen the 13th stepping that you refer to. Those people
are predators, and definitely have an agenda above and beyond sobriety. They are
preying on people when they are extremely vulnerable, emotionally, mentally, and
physically. AA is a microcosm of society, so yes, we have predators. We have
sociopaths, narcissists, psychopaths, grandmothers, mothers, fathers, teachers,
politicians( I think I covered those in the first three ), construction workers,
computer nerds,  liars, thieves, virgins, sluts, black, white, native, jewish,
muslim, hindi, and that's just in my district. I am Pagan, and have not been kicked
out of AA. I am female, have been hit on by these predators, and had the women in my
group close ranks around me. We let people know in no uncertain terms that it's not
acceptable.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Melissa,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, you are entitled to your opinion. But that does not
make the opinion automatically true or accurate. Like Senator Patrick Moynahan said,
&quot;Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I know for a fact that my higher power is not going to hand me a wonderful life on a
platter, and all I have to do is pray, meditate, and drag some other sucker in. I do
not feel guilty about what I have done in the past. Doing my inventory, and telling
my sponsor what was in it, actually helped me get over the guilt. I do not have to
rehash it, over and over. It's done. As to me having a wonderful life, I have to do
the work for that. I have to take the actions. I leave the outcome up to my higher
power. I either get what I wanted, or I don't. And I don't throw a pity party if I
don't.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you have to do the work yourself and save your own life, or else.
Welcome to the club. We are all in that situation.
So you are supplying zero evidence that A.A. or &quot;higher power&quot;
did anything good.
<p>
By the way, I do not for a minute believe that Steps Four through Ten don't
actually induce more guilt and depression.  How many years do you have
to dwell on all of your &quot;wrongs&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character&quot;?
When do you get to say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I've graduated, and I'm a good person and I don't
need to do the confession session routine any more.&quot;</font>?
</font>
<p>
I am sorry your experiences with AA have soured you so much. It's not for everyone.
And I respect that. Just as I respect your right to try to contradict anything and
everything about AA. I too believe Bill W. was full of it, and narcissistic. So
what. I take what I need from AA, and meetings, and leave the rest to people like
you to stew over.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What soured me on A.A. was seeing so many people relapse, and realizing that A.A.-based
treatment had nearly a 100% failure rate while 12-Step promoters and propagandists lied about
how well &quot;The Program&quot; really works. All of those meetings and Steps weren't helping
my friends at all. And that is what you haven't mentioned &#8212; the
A.A. success or failure rate.  What percentage of the newcomers get and stay sober?
How does A.A. really help the alcoholics? How does N.A. help the addicts?

<p>
Oh, and then there is of course the
problem that some really sick people hang around and
become the resident old-timers, and they set
themselves up as the experts and mentors to the newcomers.
And there is no sanity test required before somebody becomes a sponsor or counselor.
Heck, Bill Wilson wouldn't have passed such a test, and he got to write the <i>Big Book</i>.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Trish R.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	telling people they are incompetent<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I got to thinking about the problem of people being sent to a group that
tells them that they have been damaged in ways they can't fix.  I realized
there is a parallel in recent history that might illuminate the problem of
what AA does to people, and that would be the recovered memory movement.
People, mostly women, who were functional but vaguely unhappy in some way,
and seeking therapy stumbled upon therapists who had an a priori conviction
that unremembered sexual trauma causes all sorts of problems in adult life &#8212; 
or even ALL problems of adult live &#8212; were trained to recover memories of the
abuse.  Often the therapists sent people who claimed to have no memory of
such abuse to group therapy, where talking to others who recovered abuse
memories resulted in recovering memories of abuse.  Did this result in freer
&amp; happier ex-patients?  No, it caused people to become so distressed they
could no longer work, and damaged their relationships with families and
loved ones.  Plus, innocent family members &quot;remembered&quot; to have abused the
patients were carted off to jail.  It reminds me of the &quot;spectral evidence&quot;
that resulted in the 1619 convictions for witchcraft in Salem.

<p>
Considering what we now know, thanks to the work of Elizabeth Loftus, about
the malleability of memory, even when a person is under no social pressure
to revise a memory, and that humans are such social animals they are
perfectly willing to join and stay in groups that are damaging to them, I
think it's really important to question the method of diagnosing
alcoholism/addiction via a person recalling their life story.  Especially
when they are under pressure, whether from an AA group, or perhaps from
annoyed loved ones, employers or a court, and the claim of being &quot;diseased&quot;
might result in a second chance at a job or relationship, or avoiding jail
time.  It would be surprising if people in such circumstances didn't
suddenly &quot;discover&quot; themselves to be &quot;diseased.&quot;

<p>
On the other hand, if you take some kids and claim to their teachers that
they have higher than average IQs when they don't, by the next school year,
they will.  People tend to live up or down to the expectations of their
social groups.

<p>
Just a thought.

<p>
trish

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Trish,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And yes, it's more than just a thought.

<p>
Stephen Gaskin once said, <b>&quot;The two most important words in the
English language are <i>'I am'</i>. You must be very careful what you
put after those two words.&quot;</b>
<p>
Yes. If you say, &quot;I am stupid,&quot; often enough, you will start to believe it
and act like it.
And other people will see you as stupid.

<p>
On the other hand, if you say, &quot;I am good-looking&quot; enough that
you start to believe it, you will start to radiate an aura that makes
other people see you as good-looking.
Then you really will be good-looking. (That one is almost magical.)
<p>
So sending people to a group that tells them that they are damaged and sinful
and selfish and weak and powerless and insane and full of moral shortcomings
and defects of character and have short fuses and no patience
and little tolerance for pain does not help those people. No wonder some
of them go commit suicide.

<p>
The whole &quot;recovered memories&quot; thing is such a huge mistake. Unfortunately,
human memory is highly unreliable, and suggestible. After someone thinks about
something for a while &#8212; that is, trying to remember a suggested event that
didn't really happen &#8212; they think they can remember it, but they are really
remembering themselves imagining it and picturing it earlier.
They are remembering their own previous thoughts, not reality.
Oops!
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Parrish S. K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Another for your Hollywood list<br>

<p>
Heya:

<p>
On a few occasions, you've mentioned that Hollywood has a sort of
&quot;stealth pro-AA&quot; agenda, giving a list of various TV shows and movies
and so on where an alcoholic is portrayed as the most miserable
worthless sot in the world and whose life is turned into a miracle by
joining the Steppist church.  I know your list isn't meant to be
exhaustive (frankly, it's hard to see how it could be), but I thought
I'd add another one for you: &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.  The original,
not the remake.  I haven't seen the remake at all and so can't
comment, but in the original, the character Dylan McKay (played by
Luke Perry) gets the usual treatment you'd expect.

<p>
This is particularly ironic, because there's another story arc over a
number of episodes during a different time in the same show where
another character, Kelly Taylor (played by Jennie Garth), also gets
sucked into a cult.  Whoever did the writing knew what he/she was
doing, because the cult that Kelly joins exhibits all the stuff:
mentally ill and grandiose leader, extensive use of jargon and
slogans, busy work at the cult's compound, separating members from
&quot;outsiders&quot;, belief that cult members are special and destined for
greatness by transformation &#8212; the cult leader actually says they're
striving to become a new species, Homo Lucens, or &quot;Shining Man&quot; &#8212;
dire predictions regarding leaving the cult, and all the rest of it.

<p>
In fact, now that I think about it, it makes me wonder whether it was
the same writer (or writers) for both storylines, and what the
writers' own stories are.  I may delve into IMDb someday to see what I
can find out.

<p>
Off to get my day started... TTYL, P

<font color="blue">
Hi again Parrish,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I haven't seen that program.
<p>
That sounds very interesting though, and it does make one wonder about
whether the screen-writers saw the similarity between the cult and A.A.
(What amazes me is when they don't.)

Have a good day.

realistic member of AA for 25 years.  I applaud the depth and magnitude of
your research. I do not disagree with many of your statements and observations but I
am having difficulty following you some of your logic and conclusions. While I am
not an intellectual of your caliber, I do find your observations interesting......
It would be most helpful for me to know your background or story, before continuing

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Doug,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question.
<p>
Yes, that argument has several holes in it.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
First off, there is the complication that the statement <i>might</i> be true.
That is, there might be some other &quot;idea&quot; that should be respected.
So under certain conditions, some other idea or method <i>might</i> produce
good results. For example, if the speaker were really leading up to recommending
SMART or Rational Recovery, I would probably agree with him.
<p>
That is a subtle use of the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="newwin53">Sly Suggestions</a>
 &#8212; he suggests that &quot;other methods&quot;
will work, which sounds reasonable enough,
but he doesn't supply any facts to support that suggestion.

<p><li>
This is <a href="orange-propaganda.html#slanted" target="newwin54">Slanted Language</a>:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;when people learn to respect other ideas...&quot;</font>
<br>
Such nice words, &quot;learn&quot;, and &quot;respect&quot;, and &quot;ideas&quot;,
rather than &quot;be gullible, and accept quack medicine&quot;.
<p>
<li>
The author wasn't at all specific about what should be respected.
If Joe Blow suddenly starts promoting demonology and Satan-worship
as a cure for alcoholism and
addiction, are we supposed to respect those ideas and give them equal
consideration with methods and techniques like Rational Behavioral Therapy
or Addictive Voice Recognition? I don't think so.
<p>
That is called the logical fallacy of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="newwin41">Escape via Relativism</a>,
which essentially says, &quot;One opinion is just as good as another. One
idea is just as good as another.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Be open to new ideas&quot; and &quot;respect other opinions&quot;
is the anthem of every quack and fake doctor around. There are plenty
of frauds that should not be respected.

<p>
Yes, we should be open to new ideas. However, we should be quick to ask,
&quot;And what evidence do you have that this new idea is true?&quot;
<p>
<center>

</font></td></tr></table>
</center>

<p><li>
Then the speaker says,
<font color="black">
&quot;there are many roads that lead to recovery...&quot;
</font>
<p>
Oh really? Says who? What are they? What are their success rates?
The speaker assumes that there are &quot;many roads&quot; that work,
but where is the evidence?
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="newwin42"><i>Petitio Principii</i>, Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a>.
<p>
And the speaker is also again using <a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="newwin41">Escape via Relativism</a>,
as if one recovery method is just as good as another &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;There are many roads to recovery, and they all work,
so it doesn't matter which one you choose.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142757/http://www.behaviortherapy.com/ResearchDiv/whatworks.aspx" target="newwin47">Oh yes it does</a>.

<p>
<li>
I totally agree with the statement that when one method does not work, we should
try a different method. But that &quot;different method&quot; should not be quackery.

<p>
<li>
The speaker ends his rap with,
<font color="black">
&quot;...then I believe that the % of sucess will rise.&quot;
</font>
<p>
There, he is substituting his beliefs for facts &#8212; 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#confusion_of_beliefs" target="newwin43">Confusion of Beliefs with Facts</a>.
He has presented zero evidence that he has, or even knows of,
any better method that will really improve the percentage of successful
treatments. He just wants you to believe that such a thing exists &#8212; which
opens the door for him bringing in something that is pure quackery,
like faith healing or worshipping the Easter Bunny as your &quot;higher power&quot;.

<p><li>
If I were participating in that discussion, my next question would be,
&quot;Would you please be very specific about what 'new idea' you want us to accept?
If it's Bill Wilson's religion that was really created by Dr. Frank Buchman
in the nineteen-twenties, then it isn't 'a new idea'.&quot;
<p>
So if they are trying to sell the 12-Step program to you by calling it
&quot;a new idea&quot;, then that is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#mislabeling" target="newwin44">Deception Via Mislabeling or Misnaming Things</a>.

Dear A. Orange,

<p>
Thank you for
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="newwin50">The Cult Test Hundred Questions</a>.
I will send the link to a
good friend of mine that is currently falling into Scientology (and print
out a few choice excerpts to have them handy if she allows the discussion).

<p>
Between the time she entered her first &quot;self-help class&quot; and the time she
signed for a 2.5 years contract and started selling everything she owns in
order to move in another city to &quot;work&quot; for them, there was only 4 weeks! So
I find myself pressed for time and am using the tools at my disposal and
taking advantage of the very thorough research you put into The Cult Test.
There is no way I could prepare something this complete!

<p>
So thank you, having a solid reference like this is a great help.

<p>
P.S.: It is probably too late for my friend (although I will not stop
trying), but people around her and around me also need to be educated and
pushed towards doing their own research, because a common reaction I got
when discussing Scientology was &quot;Oh but they're one of the good cults,
right?&quot;. (AAAARGH!!!) So I'll be suggesting your Cult Test to a lot of loved
ones, as a first read. Thanks again.

on a 2.5 year contract, and she will spend years working for Scientology for free
as unpaid slave labor (although they call it &quot;working to pay off auditing and
courses&quot;).
Wow. That love-bombing and

and
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_instant_intimacy" target="newwin52">Instant Intimacy</a>
really works fast, doesn't it?
<p>
Thanks for sending the Cult Test around.
I honestly don't know why information and warnings about cults are not taught in
high school. If it came down to a choice between teaching
the students how to diagram sentences,
or how to avoid getting deceived by cults, I'd choose to teach the latter.
(In fact, I think I did. :-)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

You can see how when two families band together, they arrange themselves in
a convoy with two adults in front, and two behind. Here, their arrangement is
very loose and casual.
At other times, they arrange themselves into a very precise symmetrical
rectange with adults stationed front left, front right, rear left, and rear
right, and the goslings are always in the middle of that protective perimeter.

It's hard to say for sure in this photo, but it looks like Carmen is the gosling in the front left.

The father is on the left, and mother on the right. Again, you can easily tell

And of course the father likes to stand up tall and proud
and make himself look as
big as he can &#8212; and it also gives him a better vantage point for watching

Subject:  	Amazing<br>

<p>
Wow, and just what do you do in your spare time?  Thats amazing.  You still
spend much of your time trying to pick apart a program that works well for
millions.  This disease is like many.  Some don't get it in the first year,
but they don't give up.  Some don't get it the second time, but eventually,
people begin to get a program that works well for many.

<p>
It would depend on what your idea of success is for you to determine a
failure rate.  There are many things that people don't get the first time.
Riding a bike, an answer in school, achieving a goal.  You would suggest that
they just give up and try something different instead of looking at what
wasn't tried the first time and correct that.  Under your philosophy, everyone
would be crawling around on all fours because of the first time they fell when
they were learning to walk.

<p>
I especially like things like &quot;a million little pieces&quot; and even Mike's
response on this page.  I have weened my self from AA and now I have 18 years.
Its sort of like saying &quot;I dropped out of school and now I really have my
ABC's down packed.  I really can do this reading thing now.

<p>
I dont think that people in the AA program are saying that no one gets
sober without it.  Call it what you want, one stepper, two stepper.  It is in
regards to the change that a person makes in their behavoir along with the not
drinking.  I mean a person who stops drinking, but continues to go down to
the bar and get into fights has some serious issues.  They are still acting
like the drunk, but just not drinking.  This is something that is addressed
in the 12 step program.

<p>
And by the way Orange, what's the purpose.  Are you saving people?  I mean,
are people being seriously hurt by following the suggestions of the
program.  Bill W as you so referred to him many more times than in the book he
wrote, refers to an alcoholic, not to people who have drinking problems.
Alcoholics.  What type of a person finds joy in drinking themselves out of
families, jobs, life, freedom.  I mean, you surely would suggest that it is there
weakened will power, and they just need to what,,,,,, stop.  Do you think
that they have considered that one?

<p>
Perhaps they just need to be jailed up with the key buried so they can
never hurt themselves or anyone else.  Perhaps they mean to scar their kids for
life.

<p>
You evidently had a drinking problem at one time and decided to stop.  AA
scarred you in some way.  What was it Orange?  Were you thrown out of
treatment for not giong to meetings?  Were you sent to jail because you wouldn't
go.  Its something.  For the person who is suffering from the addiction of
alcohol and drugs can get clean from doing the hoochie coochie dance, then
thats fine.  This program is for people who wants the results of this program.
Not other outcomes.  I mean, I wouldn't go to a fish market to buy a roast
beef.   So if people don't want the things that program offers, then perhaps
they should try something different like self will,,,,,,,Oh, they usually
have tried that before coming to that program.  IT DIDN'T WORK.  It didn't
work the first time, the second or the third.  And you what Orange, they were
welcome to continue to try.  Jail sentence after  jail sentence, loss after
loss.  Go for it, its your life.

<p>
So what do you suggest Orange, what is your miraculous cure for this thing
called addiction.  Just stop!!!!!!!!!   Uh, tried it.  Keep busy?  Yea, that
helps with diabetes and high blood pressure too.  Tell everyone, wont you,
what AA did to you.  Who turned you away?  I cant see you taking this much
time for a cause that has nothing to do with you.

<font color="blue">
Hello Jaciti,
<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
Well, you pretty much declared your whole position in two sentences at 
the start of your letter, so I'll concentrate on those:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
You still
spend much of your time trying to pick apart a program that works well for
millions.  This disease is like many.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You are making a huge groundless assumption when you declare that
&quot;<a href="orange-letters120.html#helped_millions" target="newwin29">it works for millions</a>&quot;.
What works?
And where are the millions for whom it works?
A.A. does not even have 2 million members in the whole world, and it has a
huge relapse and dropout rate &#8212; barely
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin53">one percent makes
it for 10 years</a>
&#8212; so there aren't any &quot;millions&quot; of successful members.

<p>
There is zero evidence that A.A. increases the sobriety
rate of alcoholics. But there is real evidence that A.A. participation
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin21">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin22">raises the rate of rearrests</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin23">increases the costs of hospitalization later</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin24">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
</ol>
<p>
And the argument that it takes many people two or three tries before they quit
drinking and stay quit doesn't change those facts.
<p>
Then you claim that
<font color="black">
&quot;This disease is like many.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Oh really? Please define &quot;disease&quot;. What do you mean, when you say that
&quot;alcoholism is a disease&quot;?

<p>
<ol>
<li> Is alcoholism a disease like Chicken Pox or Small Pox or Ebola,
where all that you have to do is touch someone
who has the disease, and you will get infected with the virus too?

<p><li>
Is alcoholism a disease like Avian Flu or Swine Flu or the Spanish Influenza,
where somebody coughs in your face, and you inhale the virus, and now
you have it too?

<p>
<li> Is alcoholism a disease like Parkinson's Disease or Huntington's Chorea,
where you inherit a broken gene, and that dooms you to an unpleasant early death?

<p>
<li> Is it a disease like Rickets or Scurvy, which are caused by vitamin deficiencies?

<p>
<li> Is it a disease like lead poisoning or arsenic poisoning or mercury poisoning,
which are caused by accumulation of heavy metals in the body?

<p><li>
Is alcoholism a disease like PTSD, which is caused by surviving traumatic
experiences?

<p>
<li> What causes this &quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism? What is the etiology?

<p>
<li> What are the signs and symptoms of this &quot;disease&quot;, besides the fact that
alcoholics drink too much alcohol? (Which is actually a behavior problem...)

<p>
<li> If an alcoholic quits drinking alcohol for a few years, does he
still have the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;? How could you identify
such a sober person as having the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;?
(Besides perhaps poisoning that person with ethanol and seeing how he reacted,
which isn't allowed.)

<p>
<li> Is it possible for a person to have the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;
without ever drinking alcohol?
</ol>

<p>
Then you closed with,
<font color="black">
&quot;...what is your miraculous cure?&quot;
</font>
<br>
That is a cheap propaganda trick &#8212;
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#unreasonable_demands" target="newwin52">Make Unreasonable Demands</a>.
You know that there is no miraculous cure.
Criticism of A.A. quackery is not invalid just because nobody has a miracle cure
for compulsive and addictive behavior.
There is also no miracle cure for mental illness, which is the real cause
of a lot of peoples' drinking problems, but the medicines are getting better.

<p>
Now if you have read many of my responses to email, you know that I recommend
recovery methods and groups like SMART, WFS, and SOS.
<a href="orange-letters137.html#alt_list" target="newwin52">The list is here</a>,
in case you are interested (which I doubt).

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
In regards to this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Sam won the lottery, and immediately went on a huge outrageous binge of
celebration that ended in him dying drunk. He had all of the free time
and money he needed to drink himself to death, and he did. Therefore,
winning the lottery is a terrible thing that will make you die drunk.
(Likewise, success is also a dangerous thing that will probably ruin
you, so don't succeed in life.)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm not saying that you are wrong, but would it be honest to say there
is a grain of truth in that argument?  I.e. people that &quot;regularly&quot; play
the lottery are people who don't have that much experience managing
money and would be more likely to ruin themselves with that money. Or as
Ayn Rand said, (to paraphrase) &quot;they were not ruined by that money they
ruined their money&quot;. And is it better for us who seek the truth to exact
that grain of truth and ruin the rest of their arguement.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Yes, I knew when I wrote that one that it was thought-provoking,
and a two-sided coin.
I remember having heard a long time ago about some study of winners of
lotteries that found that half of the winners ended up being miserable
from the money. People went on spending binges but found that they
couldn't buy happiness. Relatives and friends nagged endlessly for a share
of the money. The winners had zillions of new &quot;friends&quot; with
ulterior motives.
Many marriages were wrecked by arguments over money and ended in divorce, and some
people did drink themselves to death.
Other people blew all of the money on parties and extravagances,
and ended up being disappointed and bitter,
and spent the rest of their days lamenting what might have been.

<p>
But it is still a gross oversimplication to conclude that winning the
lottery is a bad thing that will make you die drunk &#8212; the other
half of the people did manage to cope with being millionaires.

<p>
(And the people who were happiest were, in general,
the people who changed their lifestyles the least &#8212; people who just banked
the money and kept on with their usual routines.)

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange,
<p>
thanks for this site. Reading some of the material here validated my
decision to leave AA after 10 months. I went, reluctantly, because I had to quit
drinking to live. I was going to fewer meetings because I didn't see the point of
them. I'm not a very social person so I didn't want the company. I guess I just
sobered up enough to see what BS AA really is. I'll have one year of sobriety on
Oct. 7 and <i>I'll</i> take the credit for that, not AA.

<p>
Having worked at Harvard Med School's Division of Addictions, Phoenix
House and as a 3rd generation recovering alcoholic my experience seems to
contradict your ideas.

<p>
It was unanimously agreed when Dr. Steve Hyman, then Dir of the Div of
Addiction, next Dir of the Natl Inst of Mental Health ($900 billion a year
spent  on research) and now Provost at Harvard that AA was without a doubt the
most  effective program of recovery.

<p>
My personal observation agrees with that. Having 8  family  members with
the disease I saw the 5 that recovered all did it thanks to  AA.. The other 3
died of the disease. Believe me these were very troubled alchies  and not
&quot;Spontaneous Remissions&quot; whatever that means. I fear unfounded pieces  like
yours will cost more lives similar to the UCal San Diego &quot;studies&quot; of the
1970s.

But we do have freedom of speech. Sorry to see it used in a way that can
hurt people.

</ol>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Referring to an authority like Dr. Steve Hyman sounds impressive, but proves nothing.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
What valid and properly-done
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>
was he citing when he gave the opinion that
A.A. was
<font color="black">
&quot;the most effective program of recovery&quot;</font>?

<li>
Did Dr. Hyman actually do any real
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>
to see what works best?
<li>
Did he study anybody else's properly-performed
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>?
<li>
What other properly-tested recovery programs was he comparing
Alcoholics Anonymous to when he made that statement?
<li>
You cannot truthfully declare that one thing is the most effective
without having tested <i>all</i> of the alternatives.
<li>
Did he have ulterior motives, like that he is a hidden member of A.A. himself?

<ul>
<li>

Or does he make money by selling A.A.-based treatment?
<li>
Does he have a vested interest in 12-Step treatment?
<li>
Does he have a reputation to protect (by not recanting)?
</ul>
<li>
We know none of that.
</ul>

<p>
And I'm left really wondering why he would ignore all of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin27">the valid medical
tests</a> 
and say such a thing. Was he ignorant of the facts, or deliberately
lying, or just a stubborn cult member who won't allow his opinion
to be changed by mere facts? Or did he simply not say any such thing
at all? Or are you misquoting him? (Actually, you didn't quote him, did you?)

<p>
Oh, and can you give me a reference so I can look up what he really said?

<p>
<li> The statement that
<font color="black">
&quot;It was unanimously agreed when...&quot;</font>
is use
of the logical fallacy of &quot;Everybody knows&quot;, like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Everybody agreed when Herr Professor Flachlander declared
that the world is flat&quot;</font>.

<p>
<li>
That same line also uses the passive voice:
<font color="black">
&quot;It was unanimously agreed...&quot;</font>
What faceless, unnamed people agreed, and what do they know?
And did somebody hold an election or take a poll to see if the opinion
was really unanimous?

<p>
<li>
Then, citing the experiences of your own family sounds good, but does not
provide any actual evidence that A.A. works. You did not say that your family tried
any other methods with which to compare A.A., nor did you mention motivation.
The people who wanted to quit drinking did, and they also went to A.A. meetings
(because somebody told them that they had to),
while the people who did not wish to quit drinking did neither.
They chose to go to bars instead, and drink more,
and eventually alcohol poisoning killed them.
That is not evidence that A.A. works or does anything good.
That is evidence that the best way to avoid death by ethanol poisoning is
to stop drinking ethanol.

<p>
<li>
This statement assumes facts not in evidence:
<font color="black">
Believe me these were very troubled alchies  and not
&quot;Spontaneous Remissions&quot; whatever that means.</font>
<ul>
<li>
So how did you determine that the recovery of relatives was not
spontaneous remission? You said that it is your belief, not a fact.
You also said that you don't even know what spontaneous remission is.
So how can you be so sure that your relatives' recovery was not
spontaneous remission, when you don't know what spontaneous remission
is?

<li>
You are also assuming that Alcoholics Anonymous actually works to make
alcoholics quit drinking, which it has been repeatedly
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin28">proven to not do</a>.
<li>
So some people quit drinking and at the same time also went to some A.A. meetings
(because they really wanted to quit and were willing to try anything, even
goofy cult religion),
and you assumed that A.A. made them quit drinking, rather than that they
wisely chose to quit drinking in order to save their own lives.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
Oh, and then claiming that I am using freedom of speech to &quot;hurt people&quot; is
an old Stepper propagandists' trick &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;How many people have you hurt by telling the truth? You are doing a great
disservice to alcoholics...&quot;
</font>
Here is
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin76">a list of similar attacks</a>.
Apparently, a lot of A.A. members really don't like it when you tell the truth.
</ol>

<p>
Lastly, you say that you worked at Phoenix House? Isn't that a
12-Step facility that has a reputation for using
&quot;Confrontational Therapy&quot; to attack alcoholics or
addicts, using the vicious methods that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="newwin29">the crazy nutcase Chuck Dederich
created at Synanon</a>? Would you care to explain how that works? 
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
BTW: I am also a third-generation recovering (or recovered) alcoholic.

P.S.: I am curious about the &quot;UCal San Diego studies of the 1970s&quot;.
I had not heard of them before. Do you have a reference?
Thanks.

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
Yes it is a real question.
<p>
I have a couple if that's ok
<p>
1.Did you suffer from Alcoholism and ever go to AA?
<p>
2.Did you or someone you know get hurt by AA?
<p>
The reason I ask is that I found your site and you seem to have put a lot of
time in checking out the history of AA  and adding your own thought as is
your right and you seem to have a great dislike towards Bill Wilson. I note
occasionally using sarcasm or wit towards him personally. To put what you
have put together takes a lot of time and I was wondering why the crusade?
<p>
Trevor,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Trevor,
<p>
The answer to both questions is &quot;yes&quot;.
<p>
The list of links to the usual autobiographical information is
<a href="orange-letters136.html#autobio" target="newwin32">here</a>.
You should find answers to all of your questions there.
<p>
Have a good day.
