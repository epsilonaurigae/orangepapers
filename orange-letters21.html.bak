Hello.  I am absolutely amazed.
What an incredible amount of work you have done.  I have just begun to
explore the site, and will continue to do so.
I would suggest that you need to be more careful in your use of quotation
marks.  There are instances in which you enclose your interpretations of the
thought processes of others, as you imagine or infer them, in quotes.  This
can be misleading to the less critical reader, and could be interpreted by
the critical reader as an attempt to deceive.

Hi WS,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I agree about the problem with such remarks.
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any 100% clear way to do it &#8212; nothing
that I can think of.
Sometimes I italicize such remarks, or print them in a different color,
or enclose them in quotes, but none of those things guarantees that the
remarks will be understood as interpretations.
<p>
When we speak, we often indicate such a mode change by changing the tone of our
voice, or even mimicking the voice of another person. But that doesn't work in print.
<p>
I have the same problem with paraphrasing, too. I have had at least
<a href="orange-letters3.html#paraphrase">one reader complaining</a>
that my paraphrasing was not a literally correct quote.
I don't know of any foolproof way to indicate the mode in which things are said.

<p>
I am 20 years sober, AA.  For part of that time I was minimally active in
AA, and found myself suffering from anger, depression, fear, jealousy, and
&quot;dysfunctional&quot; personal relationships, and finally contemplating suicide,
but I thought I'd get drunk first!  Went to a meeting, and have since been
active in the program.

<p>
Your arguments regarding the relationship between AA and the court system
are right on target.  My home group is an active one, we have 14 meetings a
week, and so see many of the individuals who are sentenced to AA.  There is
currently an unspoken rule that anyone who wants their attendance sheet
signed needs to be there for the majority of the meeting.  I think that the
general feeling is that we do have something to offer, and we want what we
have to offer heard.  But this is really a &quot;policy&quot; that flies in the face
of the tradition that AA is not allied with any (etc.), and that AA is a
program of attraction rather than promotion.  I will suggest at the next
business meeting that we tell those who have been &quot;nudged by the judge&quot; that
we will sign before or after the meeting, whether they attend or not.  I
have a little problem with signing for times I didn't see them at the
location, as that is a lie, right?  Seems like the right way to do it to me.

<p>
As to the affiliation of AA with treatment centers ..... well you are right.
Go to treatment, get sent to AA.  My stepdaughter is a crack addict, sent to
long term treatment, and was told that if she wanted to stay clean she
needed to go to AA / NA.  She didn't, and stayed sober about a month.  She
wasn't offered any other alternative (that I am aware of).  I can tell you
this:  the only alternative she would have been comfortable with would have
been one that told her that her problems were someone else's fault.

<p>
How long have you been sober?  How's your sense of humor?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for all of the compliments. I've been sober for over 3 3/4 years now,
4 years in October. That includes being off of all drugs, and cigarettes too.
Thank God I finally got free of that horrible nicotine addiction.

Subject: Patty cake, patty cake, baker man,.....?

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At one university, a bunch of doctors and professors were puzzling over the
fact that all alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs seemed to have about
the same rates of success and failure, no matter what the treatment was. All
of the programs that they were studying had about a 93% failure rate (by
their counting methods), which left about a 7% success rate. Those
professors and doctors were trying to find what treatment methods worked
best, and what would save the most lives, but with all of the treatment
programs getting the same low scores, it didn't seem to matter what the
treatment was.

<p>
So, for a scientific experiment with a wacky sense of humor, the doctors and
professors designed a new treatment program for drugs and alcohol, and put
it to the test. The treatment program consisted of getting a bunch of
alcoholics and drug addicts together for a weekly meeting, which started
with playing patty cake with each other. You know, the children's nursery
rhyme where you pat your hands together:

<p>
Patty cake, patty cake, baker man,<br>
Bake a cake as fast as you can...
</font>
</blockquote>
Citation?<br>
WS

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes, you would ask about that. That is the single hardest-to-find reference
in the whole web site.
<p>
I am relying on my own memory there. What I remember is, around 1989,
I had two magazines in my hands that contained articles about alcoholism,
recovery, and Alcoholics Anonymous. (Like so many other people, my battle
with alcoholism has been a long one.)
The first magazine was the <i>Utne Reader</i>, November-December 1988.
The second one &#8212;
I can't remember what it was, and am still looking for it. That magazine
contained the patty-cake story. Computer searches have found nothing.
The Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature has no listing for patty-cake.
I went to the library and found that old issue of the <i>Utne Reader</i>,
so my memory isn't totally blown, but I still haven't found that other magazine.
I shall continue searching.
<p>
Incidentally, that copy of the <i>Utne Reader</i>
is great. It's worth going to the library and finding it.
The cover features Opus the Penguin from Bloom County at a
Herringholics Anonymous meeting, saying,
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;Hi. My name is Opus. And I am a herringholic.
I admit I am powerless over fish innards and that my life has become
unmanageable...&quot;
</font>
The focus of the magazine is, &quot;Are you Addicted to Addiction?
A skeptical look at AA and other 12-step programs.&quot;
<p>
The magazine contains a bunch of articles by
a variety of people, including Charles Bufe and Herbert Fingarette,
and then the article in favor of A.A. is by an anonymous woman
whose story reads like,
<i>&quot;At first I didn't like A.A. and thought
that the religious stuff was a bunch of nonsense. But
corny and wierd as it was, I went back every week. I was desperate.
I began consciously working the steps shortly after confessing my
depression to my Al-Anon group.
Finally I
surrendered and was transformed and now I experience endless bliss,
serenity, and gratitude. I keep coming back; it works.&quot;</i>
The story is a clear description of the process of
conversion to a cult religion, not the process of quitting drinking
or drugging.
<p>
Anyway, I shall continue to search for the source of that patty-cake
story.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Allen,
<p>
The question of how to make people see the light is a tough one.
It really depends on whether the person in question really wants to see the truth,
or is already committed to believing in the cult.

You should really be ashamed of you self ,your have the nerve to bash a community

<p>
<font color="blue">
The claim that A.A. has helped or &quot;saved&quot; 2 million people is a gross exaggeration,
one without any basis in fact.
That claim is just
<a href="orange-aalies.html#millions">one of the standard A.A. lies</a>.
Even one of the members of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Prof. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who tried for 8 years to make
A.A. look good in a test, had to report that A.A. had not accomplished anything
good, and that in fact it had
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate</a>.
<p>
Just because a cult manages to attract a bunch of people for a while does not mean
that the cult saved them, or even &quot;helped&quot; them.
Just ask the members of

Read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</a> if you want the truth
about A.A.'s success rate in &quot;helping&quot; alcoholics.

<p>
Just because you see some sober people in a room or
<a href="orange-letters20.html#convention">at a convention</a>
does not prove that the meeting made them get sober.
A.A. routinely steals the credit for people's hard work to
save their own lives.

<p>
And the reason why I have spent a lot of time on these web pages is because
I have friends in recovery, and I didn't see anybody else
telling the truth about some of these issues.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject re: your site

<p>
Hello Agent Orange.

<p>
i like your website/book.  i am a graduate of over 16 rehabs at only 19 years old
(total 2 years of in-time).  ex-heroin and crack addict and what-have-you.  anyway,
while at rehab i was forced to go to twelve step meetings and found they were only
effective if you wanted to meet fucked up chicks.  anyway i found the meetings
excruciating..all of these self-fulfilling, embarassingly opaque bromides spouted
like gospel at frequent intervals..  i just couldnt let myself go to the point where
i could allow that kind of bullshit to make sense to me and i cringed when i thought
of the type of idiotically duped personality who would feel enlightened or connected
when hearing such drivel.  so i havent been to any meetings in two years.. and havent
relapsed since i stopped going (i would relapse frequently when attending).. i now
have a good job, whereas i used to live under a bridge by a canal.

<p>
my suggestion for you is that you should condense the most
important/poignant/shocking elements of your book and convert them into easily
digestible bites conforming to user-friendly document shaping guidlines (i.e.
diamond shaped text blocks, paragraph breaks between unrelated sections) and display
links to them prominently at the top of your webpage.  even though the content is
scintillating it is off-putting to be presented with so much information and links
on one page.  then separately allow people to download the text of the entire book
or browse it online, as i dont think the internet is a good medium over which to
read things in book format.  and if the user, unfamiliar with the layout of the
books and unable to glean enough information from the text of a link about the
information it points to, the content of the site will be spread too thinly and
important information will be overlooked by the majority of people who are browsing.

<p>
thanks,

Subject: Italian reader

<p>
Hi, Agent Orange,

<p>
I am your Italian reader, and big fan, and Italian promoter, from Rome. I just
wanted to comment on a paragraph of
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Ian">your response to Ian, in Letters XV</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
You said, &quot;I had no good reason to use. I had not gone through anything emotionally
jarring.&quot; That strikes me as one of the mysteries of addictions. Sometimes you don't
get the standard list of reasons, like child abuse, sexual abuse, traumatic
experiences, or poverty. Why should well-treated rich people's kids suddenly turn
into hard-core addicts? And yet they do.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
About mysteries. I guess my husband, who is an ex-heroin addict and an active
alcoholic, is what you might call a &quot;well treated rich people's kid&quot; &#8212; but his
addiction doesn't strike me as mysterious. Maybe we tend to see things as mysterious
when we don't really look into them. When I first met him, he had just recovered
from his heroin addiction. Anyway, he was feeling good, so it seemed, he was working
and ready to commit himself in a marriage or something like it. He introduced me to
his parents, and the whole atmosphere was so cool, and  he kissed his mother on her
cheek, and the mother had cooked a good lunch, and was smiling, and everyone looked
happy and it really looked like the perfect family. The only problem is that I soon
found out it was all fake, it was all pretense, it was like an act they would put up
with each other and with anyone else.  So, I enquired more about their family and
background, and found  no child abuse, no sexual abuse, no poverty &#8212; you are right &#8212;
only crazymaking behaviours and soulmurdering techniques. As I kept asking my
husband about his childhood and later addictions... I also found out he had always
been living a double life &#8212; the perfect son and the perfect addict &#8212; and managed to
keep them apart for many, many years, without his parents ever noticing anything
strange. I had not read Laing or Bateson back then, but you did not have to be a
genius to realize that these three people were eating bread and double-bind for
breakfast, lunch and dinner. Now his father is dead, and we have lunch with his
mother every given sunday. Frankly, after I spend a few hours with her,  when she
puts up her act and my husband and I  have to comply, I feel a desperate need of a
fix myself. Now one might say: see, but you don't go and drink a bottle of chianti
like your husband, so it's genetic! Yet if you looked into my story and into my
childhood, you wouldn't need to come up with genes and receptors to explain that...
What I found out it's that trauma can be organized and stored  in many different
ways, in the mind and body of a child. So what worked for him as a child, to escape
pain &#8212; pretend and get a fix &#8212; didn't work for me, as I had to defend myself from
assaults of a different kind, in a different kind of environment.

<p>
Maybe this was inappropriate, but when I read the words &quot;mysteries&quot; and &quot;genes&quot;
associated with addictions and self-destructive behaviours,  I can't help feeling
like a punch in my stomach. What's mysterious about it? Come with your genes and
have lunch at my mother in law's!

<p>
I keep reading the documents on your site and stay your biggest fan and supporter,
hoping this was not too out of line.

<p>
Ciao

Hello again, Diana,

Thanks for another informative letter. Not too much out of line.
I can really relate to the image of the family scene where it is all
fake and pretend.
That is just so common in alcoholics' families.

Greetings!

<p>
I read the article, The Heresy of the Twelve Steps, online.

<p>
I am a recovering addict, as well as a non-denominational Minister.

<p>
I disagreed with your article for the reason that the 12 step programs,
though they claim to have, and may or may not have a spiritual/christian origin,
they have had a success in helping people address and stay clean from addictions
over the 70-odd years they have existed that the 'church' in its 2000 year
history cannot match.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Gary,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I must, however, dispute that statement.
There is no evidence that A.A. has any such kind of a success rate.
They have been lying about their success rate for more than 60 years,
and have never achieved the kind of success you are talking about.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">Read this</a>.
A.A. is nothing more than a cult religion that passes itself off as
a cure for alcoholism. And Narcotics Anonymous is the same thing.
</font>

<p>
I do agree with most of the statements in the article about how the 12 steps
tend to deviate from 'standard' Christianity on many points. However, given
that there are some 38,000 denominations (divisions) of Christianity, with all
their 'isms' and 'schisms', all preaching and teaching something different from
one another, it would seem to me that the 'Christian' churches with all their
wildly conflicting (with other denominations) theories, concepts, opinions
and traditions and doctrines about the Creator and how he relates to man can't
poin't a finger at anyone and cry 'heresy'.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney.
That is an attempt to use the debating trick called
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a></i> &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;it's just one opinion versus another, and one opinion is just as good
as any other opinion.&quot;</i></font>

Nonsense.
That is just another way of saying that there is no truth, and nobody is right,
and nobody is wrong.
<p>
Just take the dozen largest Christian churches, like the Catholics,
the Lutherans, the Church of England, the Episcopalians, the Baptists,
the Methodists, and six
more of the largest churches, and you will get a fair standard for
just what constitutes mainstream Christianity.
You can ignore the other 37,988 sects and splinter groups.
Just because someone hangs a cross on the wall and attracts a few hundred
followers does not automatically make him an authority on Christianity,
empowered to redefine Christian theology at will.
</font>

<p>
<a name="church_failed"> </a>
If the Christian church is/was/could be successful at addressing
addiction/recovery, then there would be no need for AA, NA, and the other 12-step
organizations. The fact that they exist and succeed where the church has not is a
pointed reminder that, on this matter, in most cases, the Church has just plain
failed!
<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but that is bad logic. Just because standard-brand Christianity does
not supply an easy answer to alcoholism or drug addictions does not make 12-step
cults into good organizations. There is no need for another cult.
<p>
Also, the purpose of churches and religions is not to treat
alcohol misuse or drug addictions. It isn't their job.
You are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#apples_to_oranges">
mixing apples and oranges</a>. You might as well complain that the
churches have also failed to supply us with cheap gasoline or fix global warming.
<p>
That whole rap is just a game of spiritual one-up-manship, claiming that A.A. is
a better religion than the others. That is the standard cult behavior of
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_denigrate_others"><i>Denigration of competing sects,
cults, or religions</i></a>.

</font>
<p>
I beleive from my own personal attendance and experience with these programs,
and experience in starting and operating a halfway house program for those
new in recovery, that the 12 steps, though they may or may not be doctrinally
flawed in some people's point of view, work.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
all of the real evidence</a> says that they do not work.
Just because you see some people recovering does not prove that the
12-Step meetings caused the recovery. Again, it is just like this:
<p>
<font color="#af00ff">
<ol>
<li>
A bunch of people went to a Baptist church for years.<br>
<li>
During those years, many of the women got pregnant and had babies.<br>
<li>
That proves it:
Going to Baptist churches <i>causes</i> women to get pregnant and have babies.
</ol>
</font>
<font color="#BF0000">
<b><i>Not!</i></b>
</font>
<p>
The real reason why people recover from alcoholism and/or drug addictions
is because they get sick and tired of being sick and tired, and decide to
quit wrecking their health and killing themselves.
</font>

<p>
I also beleive, and it was reflected in the policies of my halfway houses,
that regular attendance and participation at a good church is just as vital to
long-term recovery as attending the 12 step program meetings.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, I would challenge that, and say that committment to sobriety is what
is required, not the meetings of a cult religion. You are being confused by
appearances &#8212; the people who really wanted to recover and get their lives
straightened out went along with
the religious 12-step program that was shoved on them,
because they had been fooled into believing that it was somehow
necessary for sobriety. (That's what the cult keeps telling them.)
The people who decided to go get high didn't bother with the 12-step
meetings.
<p>
So you actually have the logic exactly backwards:<br>
Sobriety causes people to go to 12-step meetings, and drinking
and doping causes people
to go back to the bars for more booze, or over to the dope dealer's house...
</font>

<p>
Further more, I beleive that ultimately, on the highest sptritual level,
there is no conflict between the 12 steps and the core so-called Christian beleifs.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You've got to be joking. You just stated up above that you had to agree
with most of my statements that
<a href="orange-heresy.html">the 12-step theology departs from standard
Christian philosophy</a>,

Subject: THANK YOU!

<p>
I just wanted to take a minute to say thanks for reaffirming everything I
ever felt about twelve-step bowel movements.  I was stupid enough to get
sucked into AA/NA about twelve years ago, and I was never so miserable in my
life.

<p>
Something just didn't feel right about it from the beginning, and naive me
bit the bait to keep going back.  In retrospect, I had less esteem at the
end of it than when I walked in.  It just seemed like it was misery
perpetuated. Emotional beatdown was the order of the day, and nobody ever
really seemed that happy, resigned to a life of dredging up character
defects, real and/or imagined through inventory taking of the elders.  Then
magically, Santa would show up and I would get laid, have a lot of money,
and have respect the world over.  At the time, I worked in radio, and it
wasn't even thirty days before my anonymity got smoked and was being asked
for t-shirts and Van Halen tickets.

<p>
Turns out I have bipolar disorder.  The whole thing about not taking meds
really hit home, as I really thought there was something else going on, and
was discouraged by the deacons, as the &quot;our way is best&quot; was the thing.
What hurt even more is that nobody was even astute enough to see that I may
have been suffering with it to point it out.

<p>
Anyway, I recently met a woman who has been sober in AA for twelve years.  I
thought at first that it might have been my jaundiced view coloring my
picture of AA, but she brought it all back home.  She worried that I was an
alcoholic because I like to go have a few beers every now and then.  It got
ugly because she has such low self-esteem due to the beating down and
programming instilled in her.  She constantly lamented how she could not
differentiate between fact and fantasy.  Basically, she has such low
self-esteem because she can't handle the fact that a nice guy likes her.
Her previous relationships have been stellar.  Men with lots of years in the
program who manipulate and treat her poorly.  She constantly did
inventories, a nice way to constantly focus on what's bad in her life.  She
broke it off because she felt emotionally unequipped, and during the
discussion, she told me that she had a spiritual rebirth because of it.  She
was less than pleased when I asked her which step gives rebirth after
treating somebody like shit.

<p>
So, thanks again for your article.  I definitely needed that.

Subject: Quick question

<p>
Hi.  I came across your website sort of by accident, and I have to admit
that you've done a (technically, if not factually) impressive job putting
this site together.  My question is: why are you spending so much time and
effort trying to put down AA (or any 12 step programs it seems)?  Were you
once in AA or what?  I felt the same way you seem to when I first came to
AA, and eventually it has saved my life.  But even if it hadn't, I would
just have left and called it quits.  I don't understand the effort you seem
to put in, unless you have some resentment about it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Robert,
<p>
Ah yes, typical stepper language &#8212; &quot;have a resentment&quot;.
As if that explains everything there is to know about the mind and motivations of a
stereotypical alcoholic. If he has a resentment, then you don't need
to concern yourself with what he is actually saying.
You can safely ignore that because Bill Wilson wrote that
<a href="orange-letters16.html#axiom">
you are axiomatically spiritually wrong</a> if you get disturbed, right?
(That is a variation on the propaganda and debating trick of
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem">ad hominem</a></i> &#8212;
just find fault with the messenger, and ignore the message.)
<p>
When you say that you &quot;felt the same way ... when I first came to
AA&quot;, but eventually you became a believer, and came to believe that it
&quot;saved your life&quot;, do you realize how chilling that sounds to the rest
of us? You are describing the process of religious conversion or
brainwashing.
<p>
They changed your thinking and convinced you that they had saved your life
(so now <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_you_owe">you owe them your life</a>).
But you are the one who quit drinking.
You saved your own life.
Nobody but you holds your hand every Friday night, and nobody
keeps you from drinking but you.
You now choose not to drink alcohol, and that is your choice, and you
deserve the credit for your recovery, not some cult.
Congratulations on your sobriety.

<p>
The answer of why put so much work into it is simple: If it is worth doing,
it is worth doing right. And it is worth doing right because I have friends in
recovery, and I am in the &quot;recovery community&quot;, and I see a real need for
somebody to tell the truth about the nutty stuff that is going on in the
name of drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
</font>
<p>
The steps are really just common sense, and are nothing new to 12 step
programs.  I'm getting more and more into Buddhism, and am surprised how
similar some of the ideas are.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but the 12 Steps are a set of practices for converting people into
true believers in a cult religion. There is nothing common-sensical about
them. They were
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
developed by the fascist cult leader Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel
Buchman</a> and his Oxford Groups cult back in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties,
and Bill Wilson simply copied them
when he set up his own cult after he got kicked out of the Oxford Groups.
The 12 Steps don't even mention sobriety or recovery, do they? They are all about
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_confessions">confessions</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_induce_guilt">guilt induction</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrendering to the cult</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness">inducing feelings of powerlessness,
covert fear, guilt, and dependency</a>.
<p>
There is no similarity between the teachings of Frank Buchman, or his practices
which are embodied in the 12 Steps, and the teachings of Gautama the Buddha.
Buddha taught people to be moral and responsible for their own actions.
He never said that you were powerless over alcohol, so you should surrender
your will to a &quot;higher power&quot; or a religious cult or a bedpan.
Buddha also never taught people to expect a &quot;Higher Power&quot;
to grant wishes and deliver miracles on demand:
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li> 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.
<li> 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.
<li> 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
</ul>
</font>

<p>
Buddha never taught that &quot;God&quot; is like Santa Claus or Aladdin's Genie
&#8212; a Being who will bring the goodies if the children are good and please Him
by performing the right rituals (like confession).
<p>
Buddha never taught that &quot;Higher Power&quot; would take care of your will and
your life for you just because you &quot;surrendered&quot; and &quot;Turned It Over&quot;.
<p>
And Buddha never taught that God is a fascist dictator who demands that you follow
his orders every day or else He will kill you with alcoholism:
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

I'm am truly sorry that you took what I said 'loaded with sarcasm,
superiority etc' I actually did not have that in my heart or mind when I
wrote to you but as I know with texting, and emailing it is hard not to read
into something without any tone or inflection.
<p>
I know what I know because I've lived it both inside and outside the AA
rooms.  I spent 18 months doing it my way after 7 years in AA and all I can
say is that for me, it doesn't work.  I'm sure you will recieve plenty of
support from professionals and individuals supporting you in you quest.
There are always sceptics and people that benefit from the failure of
something beyond their control, especially ones they can't charge for.
.  My concern is that someone who needs AA, someone for whom AA would open
the doors of a healing journey so that they feel they can rejoin the human
race again, might find your website first and die without a chance at a
life.
<p>
AA may not be the answer for everyone, one of my friends in Cairns works in
a rehab and does not subscribe to the 12 steps, we are still good friends
and he has sent some people to me tht he would rather back over with his
4x4, some of them stay, some of them go, but I have yet to see someone who's
gone back out from AA and come back in with news of a better way, and lets
face facts AA is usually the last stop for people after shrinks, doctors,
numerous tests and alternative therapies.
<p>
Thank you for you reply, and I will still pray for you, I'm saying that with
a bit of a smile on my face cause I imagine the first time you heard tht

If you relapsed, it was because you started believing the yammering of

grumbling about wanting to feel good, and insisting that
having just one, or just a few, was quite okay.

Remember that the lizard brain is not you. It's just the walnut-sized brain of a dumb lizard who

The way that I stay sober is by recognizing the mind games that lizard brain tries to pull on me,

wanted to be, is unaddicted and clean and clear-headed and on a spiritual high.
Even while I smoked like a
chimney for 30 years, and drank like a fish for 15 years, my way, what I really wanted to be, was unaddicted.
And that is where I have finally ended up. So doing it &quot;my way&quot; is really okay.
<p>
Then you bring up a big important issue when you say, &quot;A.A. isn't for everybody.&quot;
Well who is it for? Who decides who will get forced into the meetings of the A.A. cult religion, for
their own good?
<p>
The U.S. Constitution says that NOBODY can get forced into a religion, but it happens every day in drug courts
and traffic courts.
<p>
Besides, considering
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">the staggeringly
high death rate and failure rate of A.A.</a>, how can it really
be good to send anybody to A.A.?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

My opinion is that you think you know us. This fellowship is not Bill

<font color="blue">
Hi Gary,
<p>
You are simply trying to dodge the issues. When people are
<a href="orange-sentenced.html">sentenced to A.A. by the judge</a>,
they are not sent to you personally, they are sent to
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous The Organization</i>.
The same goes for people who seek treatment for alcoholism,
only to get sent to A.A. meetings, or N.A. meetings for other substance misuse
problems. (I speak from experience, so I do know
something about those meetings and &quot;the multitude of you's&quot;.)
So it is about A.A. and N.A., not you.
<p>
In addition, have you *ever* stood up in an A.A. meeting and announced that, since
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">
Bill Wilson was a lunatic</a>, we should all just ignore the first 164 pages
of the <i>Big Book</i>, and develop some new ideas about recovery that are based
on sanity and common sense? I think not.
Have you ever openly declared that the Twelve Steps are bunkum, bilge, and flapdoodle?
I think not.
<p>
So you are trying to have it both ways. When I criticize the insanity of
Bill Wilson's proclamations, you respond that Bill isn't A.A.. But when I'm not
looking, you will go back to praising Bill Wilson and his program,
and declaring that he created the greatest organization for recovery in the world,
a path that leads to God, etc...
And you will begin every meeting by reading the Twelve Steps out loud and saying
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;These are the Steps that we took&quot;</font>,
won't you?
</font>
<p>

What appears
obvious is you.  Pretty &quot;base brain&quot; feeding that ego of yours. I would
apologize for the last two lines but something tells me you're going to
respond to this OPINION, hence adding credibility.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I'm having a hard time responding to that, because it
is incomprehensible gibberish. Are you trying to declare that I am just on an ego
trip? If so, you are doing a poor job of it.
<p>
When I quote
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
all of the doctors who have found that A.A. is a failure</a> as a treatment
program for alcoholism, that isn't ego. That's facts.
<p>
If I were really interested in ego and self-aggrandizement, I would at least use
my real name so that I would get the credit,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk">like how Bill Wilson did</a>.
</font>

<p>
:ALL IS THEORY

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is an attempt to use the propaganda trick of

Dear Agent,

In the past few weeks I have been spending hours of time searching for
different perspectives and opinions concerning the negative aspects of AA. I've
read several of your articles and have taken comfort from them because of my
terrible need for &quot;Deprogramming.&quot; When time permits I will write to you and try
to describe some of what has happened to me &#8212; which I'm quite confident will
reinforce the views you have documented.
For now I feel obligated to tell you that knowing that there are others
that feel the way I do has been a tremendous help to me. I have experienced
loneliness as a result of choosing to leave AA and the &quot;Fellowship&quot; as most of
the people that I've known for many years were met there. Even though I was a
very likable and generous fellow, once I walked away I was labeled some kind of
monster.

Hi Steve,

I have been sober for over a year now after getting drunk again and have had
a lot of sober time before this as well.... But this time I have not attended AA
meetings or had anything to do with the &quot;Program.&quot;  In this past year I have
managed to become employed and was recently promoted to Operations Manager
overseeing the company that I work for, gotten on top of my finances, furnished
a modest apartment very comfortably, made a few &quot;normie&quot; friends, have repaired
the relationship with my family, began lifting weights again...and so on. My
life is becoming very calm and a s???re and very much free of conflict or shame.
<p>

Congratulations on your sobriety.

I could probably write a book on the betrayal and abusiveness I've come to
know in AA but for now I just want to thank you for your honesty, your teaching
me to say &quot;have a nice day anyway&quot; and your intelligent writing and perspective.
You have obviously put a tremendous amount of time and thought into your work

<p>
Dear Mr. or Ms. Whomeveryouare:

<p>
Let me begin by stating that A.A. saved my life.  That
is, without A.A., there probably wouldn't have been a
beckoning, attractive and &quot;humane&quot; rehabilitation
center for me to check myself into in the year 2000 &#8212;
and without that rehabilitation center &#8212; I most likely
would have continued to smoke crack until I died.
A.A. afforded me the ultimate prize: Life.  That is,
A.A. allowed me to take a breather &#8212; it allowed me to
put down the crackpipe for a moment &#8212; stay alive &#8212; and
regain my faculties.  A.A also introduced me to the
idea/fact that I am not alone &#8212; that I am not the only
one fighting the ills of addiction.  I can't begin to
tell you how much meeting and interacting with fellow
addicts and alcoholics has helped my psyche'.  A.A.
also lead me to God.  I believe that God lead me (a
former agnostic, who always leaned towards the idea of
a God) to A.A. and A.A. lead me to God.

<p>
With that said, and in as much as A.A., indeed, did
save my life, I can now tell you that I no longer
attend A.A. services. I could go on, &quot;infinitum&quot; as to
my decision &#8212; but it would be redundant &#8212; as most of
my reasons have been cited by you on your web-site.

<p>
The reason I am writing is to ask you this:

<p>
How much is A.A. currently making on their books?
(I haven't been able to find a figure on the Internet)

<p>
Their set-up is unbelievable.  &quot;......Cunning and
baffling.....&quot;.  A baffling amount of money being made
by cunning (semi-well intentioned) charlatans.

<p>
I look forward to your reply.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Todd

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Todd,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.

<p>
Honestly, I think you are giving credit to
A.A. where credit is not due.

It is great that you got a
&quot;beckoning, attractive and 'humane' rehabilitation
center&quot; to detox in, but A.A. is not responsible for that.
That treatment center would have been there anyway, no matter who
dominated the field of alcoholism treatment.
And the treatment might have been better.
<p>
If history had been different, we might have the Keeley League, or
the Women's Chistian Temperance Union, or The Washingtonian Movement,
or the Salvation Army, or Keswick, or the Emmanuel Clinic,
or any of several other groups,
dominating the field of drug addiction and alcoholism treatment and running the
treatment centers. And we might be a lot better off, as a result, too.

<p>
A.A. routinely claims that they single-handedly invented the field of
the treatment of alcoholism and addictions, but nothing could be further from the truth.
All that Bill Wilson did was claim the credit for the work of other people.
Basically <i>everything</i> that is good about Alcoholics Anonymous was
stolen from somebody else. See my short write-up about
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery">
the history of other, earlier,
alcoholism recovery organizations or &quot;movements&quot; here</a>.

<p><br>
Now, about the money from the <i>Big Book</i>:<br>
It is hard to get exact numbers because the A.A. headquarters does not like
to release financial information to the public. The GSO (General Service Office)
is, however, required
to file some documents with the IRS in order to keep their non-profit status,
so we can piece together some numbers.

<p>
They rake in a few million here, and a few million there.
According to their 2002 financial statement, they had $6 million in the bank,
just a comfortable little reserve, down from $10 million in 1998.
<p>
I hear that in 2000, the book sales income was about $9.7 million
(profit $6.6 mil), and contributions were $4.5 million.
Total operating expenses (above direct costs of publication) were $10.7 million.

<p>
Also, the American A.A. headquarters &#8212; A.A.W.S. &#8212;
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. &#8212; collects &quot;royalties&quot;
for the out-of-copyright <i>Big Book</i> from many foreign countries, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">
even committed perjury in courts in Mexico and Germany and got A.A. members
sentenced to prison</a> to protect that income.
<a href="orange-letters16.html#Works_Inc">
The copyright on the <i>Big Book</i> is invalid, null and void</a> for several
reasons, but that isn't
what the A.A.W.S. representatives told the judges in those foreign courts.
(Because the copyright is invalid, you can download your own copies of the
<i>Big Book</i> over the Internet for free,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160814045354/http://www.recovery.org/aa/download/BB-plus.html">here</a>.)

<p>
But above all, when discussing the finances of A.A.,
remember that A.A. is a funny organization &#8212; sort of like a loose confederation.
It has many branches, front groups and subsidiaries that are not legally connected.
They are connected only by a common desire to promote the 12-Step religion.
(Although they may have financial connections, like Hazelden being the biggest
reseller of the publications of A.A.W.S..)
<p>
The big money does not go to the A.A. headquarters in New York,
it remains one level down in the pyramid, in the hands of the front groups
and promoters like the Hazelden Foundation and the Betty Ford Clinic,
entities that charge $15,000 or more for a 28-day-long A.A. meeting.
That is a lot more money than they will ever make from selling
a $6 book to somebody.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Would you care to be specific? What do you think I have made A.A. into
that it is not?
<p>
Have a good day.

Mr. O

<p>
Loved your AA website. I just finished watching Penn &amp; Teller give us a good bashing
on
Showtime &#8212; wonderful stuff. It is sorta a cult, and I'm kind of a member (13 years).
But why don't they want my money like other cults? $1 an hour? Not exactly a get
rich quick scheme. And as for the courts sending us new recruits... who needs 'em.
You take 'em. Do keep up the good work. Don't want to hang with the kind of
crybabies who cater to your spin anyhow. Humorless.

Hi Rod,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments (even if some of them were back-handed).
<p>
About the money &#8212; Not all cults are obsessed with making money.
Most of them are, but not all.
<p>
In general, most cults spend most of their time on two major activities:
<ol>
<li> making money
<li> recruiting and indoctrinating new members
</ol>
<p>
&quot;Most cults&quot; means &quot;more than 50 percent of them&quot;.
<p>
But being money-grubbing is not a universal characteristic of all cults.
That is why
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_money_grubbing">the money question</a>
is only one of a hundred cult characteristics
in the cult test. There is a lot more to the definition of a cult than
just being obsessed with making money.
<p>
When we think of the money-grubbers, names like
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#Scientology_money">Scientology</a>,
the Moonies, Jim Jones's <i>People's Temple</i>,
and
<a href="orange-letters5.html#ISKCON">the Hari Krishnas</a>
immediately come to mind.
But then we have seen some other really deadly cults like
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#Koresh">David Koresh, the Wacko from Waco</a>, and his Branch Davidians,
<li> Luc Jouret and the Solar Temple (&quot;Commit suicide for the summer solstice&quot;), and
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q4.html#Heavens_Gate">The Heaven's Gate cult</a>
(&quot;Commit suicide and hitch a ride on a flying saucer&quot;)
</ul>
&#8212; who were not particularly interested in money.
They just made enough to get by on. Their big interest was in other things,
like dying and going to Heaven.
<p>
The street variety of A.A. is also one of the cults that is not
interested in making money.
They just want your will and your life (that's Step Three).
<p>
Institutional A.A. (Hazelden, The Betty Ford Clinic, etc.),
on the other hand, where they charge $15,000 or more for a
28-day course of indoctrination in the 12 Steps, is extremely money-grubbing.
On an hourly basis, they must be about as expensive as Scientology, and just as
ineffective, too.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters11.html#seven_rehabs">Read this letter</a>
from a woman who got burned by such treatment centers again and again.
Read
<a href="orange-letters21.html#k30k">this very recent letter</a>
from another guy who got bilked out of $30,000.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject: AA Big Lie

<p>
Hello Mr. Orange,

<p>
My dad has attended AA since 1989.
He claims to be a Christian and so do I.
But AA breaks the first commandment.

<p>
I have pointed out to him spiritual and logical errors with AA
but he responded in standard &#8212; Big Lie technique &#8212; fashion.

<p>
I am enjoying your web site.

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hi Scott,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You are right about
<a href="orange-heresy.html#bedpan">A.A. breaking the first commandment</a>.
It is absurd to tell
people that they can worship anything as their &quot;Higher Power&quot; &#8212; a bedpan, a
motorcyle, a doorknob, or a &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;. 
<p>
And then,
<a href="orange-letters16.html#material_God">I get told by the A.A. true believers</a>
that worshipping that kind of a material God
is just an introductory thing &#8212; it's a training-wheels God &#8212;
that the beginners will eventually <i>Come To Believe</i> in
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#one_true_God">The One True God</a>&quot;
of Alcoholics Anonymous. But that doesn't make things
much better &#8212; that just makes it a bait-and-switch stunt where
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything">first you don't have to
believe anything, and then you do</a>; or
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater">first you can have any
God you want, and then you must believe in the A.A. version of God, or 
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#keep_your_religion">first you can keep
your own religion, and then you can't</a>.
</ul>

<p>
And then there is
<a href="orange-spirrel.html">this obnoxious propaganda from the Hazelden Foundation</a>
that teaches us
to dump our current religions, and just believe in the Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;spirituality&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is a spiritual program, not a
religious one. ...<br>
Ideally, religion helps you achieve spirituality,
but if it doesn't, then set it aside for a while.&quot;<br>

<p>
I'm not sure how you are supposed to reconcile that with the first commandment.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject: Thanks for the interpretated version

<p>
Just a letter of appreciation to you for posting this on the web. I have been in
recover for 4 years now and never heard of these steps from this light. I was one of
those brainwashed at one time, or at least I was attending meetings. I just never
could accept what they were saying though. They (A.A.'s) always said I was still
fighting it, hahaha. Seems funny I have been out of their program for 1 1/2 years
and haven't slipped yet. I feel stronger now than ever. I found real answers with my
Lord Jesus Christ. I hope this doesn't offend you.

<p><font color="blue">
Hi Scott,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and no, I am not at all offended by mentions of Jesus Christ.
I like the guy too. I have to keep telling some A.A. members that I am not
an atheist; I just don't believe in Santa Claus or Aladdin's Genie who will
magically grant all of your wishes if you grovel before him. Christ's suffering
on the cross alone should be enough to teach them that, but no, they just don't
get it. Oh well...
<p>
Incidentally, if you liked the
<a href="orange-interpreted.html">12 Steps Interpreted</a>,
then you will probably love
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>.
That is where I specifically go after the
conflicts between Christian philosophy and 12-Step philosophy.
</font><p>

I teach an overcomers class on
Wednesday nights at church and am going to be using this material. Please keep my
email, I would like to correspond with you sometime. I also really enjoyed your
website, at least what I have seen of it so far. Would you please send me the link
to it, I lost it. I was able to view this information by signing up to the
newsgroups on windows but, something has went haywire and I lost access to the
newsgroups. Also I am unsure how to sign back up for them. It was mere luck the
first time. Stay in touch with me if you would.

Okay, you have my email address and the web site address from the signature and
the links. Enjoy, and have a good day.
