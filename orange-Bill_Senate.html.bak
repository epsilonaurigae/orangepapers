<p>
STATEMENT OF BILL W., CO-FOUNDER, ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS


<p>
&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill W:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Chairman, Senators, we of
AA, it is already apparent, are going to have reason for great
gratitude on account of your invitation to put in an appearance
here. For me this is an extremely moving and significant occasion.
It may well mark the advent of the new era in this old business of
alcoholism.


<p>
I think that the activities of this committee and what they may
lead to may be a turning point historically. This is splashdown
day for Apollo. The impossible is happening. Like my dear friend
Marty [Marty Mann], who has just spoken to you, I share with her
the opinion that in this field of alcoholism we are now seeing the
beginning of the achievement of the impossible. Because or my
appearance here as an AA member, I have to limit myself pretty
much to statements about AA. But you must remember that as time
passes in these hearings a great many AA's will be testifying as
citizens, and they will be far more free to express opinions on
the general field and their activities in it than I am.


<p>
So I take it that my mission here today will be to acquaint you
with the resources that AA may reveal for treatment, for education
and so on. I shall start off by taking the dry part of my recital
first: a few figures. Our national magazine, &quot;The AA Grapevine,&quot;
makes a brief and simple statement as to what AA is: Alcoholics
Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve
their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.
The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
There are no dues or fees for membership. We are self-supporting
through our own contributions. AA is not allied with any sect
denomination, politics, organization or institution, does not wish
to engage in controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes.
Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to
achieve sobriety.


<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
Now, as a little more background for my presentation, let me
present just a few figures. Our last census, that is to say,
reports of our group sessions, shows that we have 15,000 AA groups
throughout the world and an active membership of 285,000. Besides
the 285,000 there are hundreds of thousands &#8212; maybe 200,000, for
all we know,
<a href="#ftnt01">300,000 recovered AA's on the sidelines</a> who do not
get caught up in the active statistics, people who have remained
for the greater part sober, who are carrying AA attitudes and
practices and philosophies into the community
life.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
So AA is much
more in reality than a generator of mere sobriety, it is returning
us to citizenship in the world. Now, then, that breaks down these
figures into something like this: groups in the United States,
9,000, active members, 148,000; groups in Canada, 1,500; members
in Canada, 21,000; groups overseas, 3,300, membership, 62,000;
internationalists, 344. We mean by that, people on ships, largely,
who travel from port to port spreading the AA message. We have 648
groups in hospitals, members in hospitals (and this means largely
mental institutions), 18,500; and groups in prisons, 33,000. And
lone members throughout the world, who correspond with the world
headquarters, 522.


<p>
Those statistics are of interest, but they are scarcely
inspiring, because they are not as yet connected with the flesh
and blood of human experience. I think the best way of presenting
some of that experience would be to relate to you certain
fragments of AA history that have a particular bearing upon this
occasion. Oddly enough, and contrary to the information of most
people, Alcoholics Anonymous, we see in retrospect, very
definitely had its start in the offices of one of the founders of
modern psychiatry.


<p>
I refer to Karl Jung, who in the early 1930s received a patient
from America, a well-known businessman. He had run the gamut of
the cures of the time, and desperately wanted to stop and could
get no help at all. He came to Jung and stayed with him about a
year. He came to love the great man. During this period the hidden
springs of his motivation were revealed. He felt now with this new
understanding, plus communication with this new and wonderful
friend that he had really shed this strange illness of mind, body
and spirit.


<p>
Leaving there, he was taken drunk, as we AA's say, in a matter
of a month, perhaps, and coming back, he said, &quot;Karl, what does
this all mean?&quot; Then this man made the statement which I think led
to the formation of AA. It took a great man to make it. He said,
&quot;Roland, up until recently I thought you might be one of those
rare cases who could be aided and made to recover by the practice
of my art. But like most who will pass through here, I must
confess that my art can do nothing for you.&quot; &quot;What,&quot; said the
patient, &quot;Doctor, you are my port of last resort. Where shall I
turn now? Is there no other recourse?&quot; The Doctor said &quot;Yes, there
may be. There is the off-chance. I am speaking you of the
possibility of a spiritual awakening, if you like, a conversion.&quot;
&quot;Oh,&quot; said the patient &quot;but I am a religious man. I used to be a
vestryman in the Episcopal Church. I still have faith in God, but
He has little in me, I should think.&quot; Jung said, &quot;I mean something
that goes deeper than that Roland, not just a question of
faith.


<p>
I am talking about a transformation of spirit that can motivate
you and set you free from this. &quot;Time after time alcoholics have
recovered by these means. The lightning strikes here and there,
and no one can say why or how. All I can suggest is that you
expose yourself to some religious environment of your own choice.&quot;
The patient went to England. He became associated with the group
of that day in later years called &quot;Moral Rearmament,&quot; [the Oxford
Groups] and to his great surprise he began to feel released from
this hideous compulsion. He returned to America. He had a place in
Vermont. There he ran into a friend of mine about to be committed,
a friend that we AA's lovingly call Ebby.


<p>
Ebby, at the time a wealthy man, had just run his car through
the house of a farmer, into the kitchen, pushing in the wall, and
when he stopped, out stepped a horrified lady from inside and he
said, &quot;How about a cup of coffee?&quot; This was the extent of his
illness and he was about to be committed. The patient, Roland, got
hold of him, took him to New York, exposed him to the Oxford
Groups, whose emphasis was upon admission of hopelessness, in a
sense, on one's unaided resources a human being could not go too
far. Another was self-survey. Another was a species of confession,
and then there was restitution and belief in a Higher
Power.


<p>
That movement was rather evangelical, but AA owes it a great
debt in what to do and also in what not to do. Then, thinking of
me, and I was about at the end of my rope, my friend visited me.
In the previous summer I had been in a drying-out emporium in New
York City, and there my doctor, who was to make a crucial
contribution to AA, had said to my wife, &quot;Lois, I am afraid, my
dear, that I can do nothing. I thought that he might be one of
those rare instances in which I could help him stay sober, but I
am afraid not. He is the victim of a compulsion to drink against
his will, and, as much as he desires, that compulsion I don't
think can be broken; and this compulsion is coupled with what I
call an allergy. &quot;


<p>
It is a misnomer, but it is indicating that there is something
wrong with this man physically. Therefore, the eternal dilemma has
been this eternal compulsion to drink, to the point almost of
lunacy, coupled with the physical allergy that guarantees insanity
and death. I think you will have to lock him up.&quot; After that
treatment I came home and a few months later this friend appeared,
sat across the kitchen table where there was a big pitcher of gin
and pineapple juice.


<p>
I was a solitary drinker of about two or three bottles of
bathtub gin a day. The year is 1934. Enters this friend of mine
that I had known to be a very hopeless case. At once it struck me
that he was in a state of release, this just was not another drunk
on the wagon. Then he told me this story, how he had felt this
relief, the moment he had gotten honest with himself and adhered
to their simple program, he began to feel this release, how much
more he had gotten through his friend, Roland. He told me the
story about him. Finally I put the question to him. I said, &quot;Ebby,
you say you don't want to drink, you are not drinking today. What
does this mean?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, I have got religion.&quot; I said,
&quot;Well, what brand is it?&quot;


<p>
So he revealed to me his story. I was deeply impressed, really,
because here was somebody that I knew had lived in this strange
world of alcoholism, where I, too, was a denizen. So this
transmission of the fatal nature of this malady in many cases
struck me. I think it caused a great personal deflation and laid
the ground for what was subsequently to happen. My friend went
off. I didn't see him for a few days. In no waking hour could I
forget the face across the kitchen table. Yet I gagged on this
concept of a Higher Power, even in its lowest denominator. So I
finally decided I would go to the hospital, get detoxified. I
appeared at the hospital. Dr. Silkworth began treatment. I
announced that I had found something new, I thought, I wanted to
get sobered up. I could not have any emotional conversion.


<p>
So after about 3 days detoxification, I found myself falling
into a terrible depression. I felt trapped. In other words, I was
asking the impossible, to believe in a Higher Power, let alone
cast my dependence on it on the one side, and yet my guide in
science [Dr. Silkworth] was saying, &quot;But medically you are pretty
hopeless.&quot; Out of this eventuated a very sudden spiritual
awakening in which I was released from this compulsion to drink, a
compulsion on my mind morning, noon and night for several years. I
was suddenly released from it.


<p>
Mine was a rather spectacular experience. But it is quite
identical to what happens to any good AA. In other words, their
experiences are apt to take a longer time and they are not so
sensational, but we do get the transforming effect on motivation.
With the experience came this thought: Why can't this be induced
chain style? In other words, I can identify myself with another
alcoholic through this kinship of suffering, then why can't that
inflate him and perhaps he will be motivated and one can talk to
the other.


<p>
I came out of the hospital, began to feverishly work with
alcoholics. We had a house full of them. I was so keyed up with
the paranoid side with my spiritual awakening, I even thought I
had a kind of divine appointment about all the alcoholics in the
world. There was 6 months of complete failure. Finally I went to
Akron on a business trip to see if I could regain my fortunes. I
was away from my friends. The business deal fell through. I had
hardly carfare home and all of a sudden the old desire to drink
started to come back. I was frightened. Then I realized that in
talking and trying to help other alcoholics, even though the cases
had all been paid, this had a great deal to do with my staying
sober.


<p>
These were the elements of the process and through a strange
set of circumstances I was led to a physicist and from there to
the doctor in town who was to become my partner in this thing. He,
too, when the nature of his malady was revealed to him in medical
terms, one drunk talking to another, achieved sobriety that he had
long since thought impossible. Shortly after that, in one of the
Akron hospitals, No. 3 got sober, and an AA group, the first one
really, came into existence in June 1935 in Akron, Ohio. Then
there was a return to New York and a group started there. A few
people in from Cleveland began to come to the group meetings in
Akron. We grew very, very slowly, trial and error all along the
line.


<p>
If it seemed to work, get with it, if it failed, discard it.
That was our practice until about 4 years later, after hundreds of
failures, we found that we had a hundred people sober. At that
time, having retired from the Oxford Group, and yet having no name
actually, we just called ourselves a nameless bunch of drunks
trying to help each other get well. At that time we began to think
in terms of a book, which supported by case histories would
portray our approach. The book is called Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; and
it was published when we had a hundred members.


<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
Up to this time we had been virtually a secret society. Then we
realized that we would have to be publicized.
<a href="#ftnt02">So we were very reluctant about this</a>,
what kind of people would come
in?<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>

We were
publicized first by Liberty magazine, and flooded by 6,700
inquiries into a post office box in New York. We gave these
inquiries to a few of our traveling people out of the small
established groups. Then came an experience in mass production of
sobriety which I think is most relevant to any presentation
here.

<p>
Up until the fall of 1939, 5 years after I had sobered up, we
had thought that the presentation of our case to the other
alcoholics was up to the founding fathers or the elder hierarchy
or whatnot. We thought it to be a very slow business indeed. The
idea of a mass revival was very far from our minds. The Cleveland
Plain Dealer decided to publish a series of articles about us.
There was a chap doing the articles who himself was an alcoholic.
The poor devil never recovered, but he could talk our language.
These articles were placed in a box on the editorial page every 3
or 4 days and a supporting editorial was written. Then our friends
of the press and the communications media began this benign
process of bringing us customers. At this time the group in
Cleveland numbered only about 20 people. They were suddenly
confronted with hundreds of frantic telephone calls to hospitals
and people with or without money, people who were hospitalized
this week, next-week were going with an older member to see
somebody in the hospital.


<p>
This thing pyramided so that in the succeeding year of 1940
these 20 had pyramided themselves into what had turned out to be
several hundred sound recoveries. Now this is the final
suggestion, that the resources of Alcoholics Anonymous for mass
society have hardly been touched. This set of figures shows in the
last 10 years Alcoholics Anonymous membership has pyramided at the
rate of only 8 or 10 percent a year, when in the early days, in
the first decade, increases of 100 percent 500 percent 1,000
percent were very common. Therefore, we have a tremendous lot of
people with whom to deal. This is partly due to the reluctance of
the alcoholic himself.


<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
Figures tell us that we have 5 million alcoholics in America.
This means 5 million poor souls who are in all stages of this
dissolution and in the early years scarcely one of these people
can be brought to believe that he is actually beginning to be
sick. This rationalization can exist right through all sorts of
evidence of sickness right down to the undertaker himself. It is
this mass capability of the alcoholic to rationalize himself out
of this predicament. This is one of the great obstacles to
bringing alcoholics toward treatment. In fact this is the obstacle
that all of the remarkable agencies we now have at work are
running against, how do we get these people in?


<p>
It is a process of education, but what kind of education we
simply don't know. Another part of the resistance of Alcoholics
Anonymous stems from the fact that it has a spiritual content and
a great many of our professional friends are apt to believe
Alcoholics Anonymous is for the religiously susceptible only.
Well, this is a very mistaken impression. At last year's New York
dinner, we were talking about this topic and it suddenly occurred
to me that of the four speakers on the platform, only one of us
four had any religious background whatever. Why were they in AA?
They were driven there because there was no other place to go, no
other place to get well. So these are the treatment resources. How
can the resources of experience which have to do with the other
agencies and disciplines in the field be brought to this committee
by our friends and by AA members who are also working in these
area?


<p>
You have begun to surmise that in effect, we are coming out of
the woodwork, we are in practically all of these efforts bringing
the AA experience to them, making it available and that kind of
experience can be made available by any members here in these
committee hearings if they come here acting as citizens and
recovered alcoholics [but not as AA members]. We have to do that
as a protective thing for AA. Now we have great numbers of
friends. Those, too, can be called upon and I notice that some are
going to be available here. For instance here is Jack Norris, a
nonalcoholic. Many of you know him. He is chairman of our board of
trustees. He is second in charge, or was until his retirement in
the medical department of Eastman Kodak, the second industrial
company to give the nod to AA and make use of the
resources.


<p>
In Wilmington, for example, we have Dr. Glanto, the head of the
medical department of the first company ever to make AA
arrangements with AA. I think he would be quite happy to testify.
On our board we have Mr. Austin McCormick, one of the country's
great criminologists, and I think he could throw much light on the
situation. We have AA members beyond count. So you have that sort
of resource available for treatment and for experience. Well, I
think I am presenting this overlong and perhaps you gentlemen
would like to ask questions at this point.


<p>
<b>Senator Hughes:</b> &nbsp; Bill, I thank you for your bring us up
to date on the beginnings and where you are now. I would like to
ask some pointed questions. No.1, I have never been in a prison
institution, I have never been in mental hospital institution,
where there was not an AA group in my years in public life, not
only of the inmates but of people coming in from the outside who
were conducting meetings in an effort to help these people
recover. This is also true in the case of halfway houses, private
treatment centers, and every public treatment center that I know
of dealing with the alcoholic where there are Government programs
sponsored by State, community, or county divisions. I take from
your testimony that as a cofounder of AA you certainly believe
that in any program this committee and this Congress might
develop, that there would be a place and a willingness for AA
members to work in recovery, education, and counselling of the
ailing alcoholics, and prevention also?


<p>
<b>Mr. Bill W:</b> &nbsp;  I should think so. Of course, this is
the pleasure of our friends. But certainly this experience is of
great value and in respect of this communication one alcoholic is
certainly of unique value.


<p>
<b>Senator Hughes:</b> I think what you indicated is what I
expected. No. 1, we have available through Alcoholics Anonymous a
resource of willing people whom you have indicated have the
capabilities of multiplying not 100 percent, but 1,000 percent if
they can get to the people.


<p>
<b>Mr. Bill W:</b> &nbsp;  If we can get to the people.


<p>
<b>Senator Hughes:</b> &nbsp;  This is the essence of my question.
Undoubtedly knowing the organization quite well myself, these
people have dedicated themselves to doing the job of calling on
alcoholics and assisting in any way they can in their
recovery.


<p>
<b>Mr. Bill W:</b> &nbsp; Yes. Of course, it ought to be observed at
this point that the virtues of AA are not really earned virtues.
It is a matter of do or die. Nothing is too good for the next
sufferer. So our dedication is first based on the fact that our
lives and fortunes have been saved and we want to share this with
the next fellow, knowing that it is a part of the maintenance of
our own recovery and life or death. So this is the source of the
great dedication that you see among the AA.


<p>
<b>Senator Javits:</b> &nbsp; I would like to just join the Chair in
what he has said and assure you, sir, from what I see here, we
will do our utmost to utilize to the fullest these resources which
you have so eloquently testified to.


<p>
<b>Senator Hughes:</b> &nbsp;  Thank you very much, Senator Javits.
Senator Yarborough?


<p>
<b>&nbsp;Senator Yarborough:</b> &nbsp; Mr. Bill W., I am astonished
to learn that AA had its beginning in 1934 and 1935 and was very
small until 1939. Because the escalation was so fast after that,
so well known nationally now, that you have an idea this has gone
on for generations.


<p>
<b>Mr. Bill W:</b> &nbsp;  When you consider the enormous
ramifications of this disease, we have just scratched the surface.
I think we should humbly remember this.


<p>
<b>Senator Yarborough:</b> &nbsp; The experience you personally
described when this burden fell away from you, I have thought back
in my reading, I know of only two other men who have had such a
dramatic experience. One was Saul of Tarsus, on the road to
Damascus and the other was Sam Houston, the great national hero.
Sam Houston, who once was called by the Indians, Big Drunk,
became, while he was a U.S. Senator, a temperance lecturer all
over the United States. Congratulations on what you have done for
so many hundreds of thousands who are in your debt and the
millions I believe who will be reached in the not distant
future.


<p>
<b>Senator Hughes:</b> &nbsp;  Bill, I thank you kindly for your
willingness to come forward as a cofounder of the fellowship of
Alcoholics Anonymous and express the basis of its founding,&nbsp;
willingness to cooperate, and the hope of people over the last few
decades who have found their way through this. The Subcommittee
and the Committee are indebted to you for your willingness to do
this. I want to express also the Chair's appreciation to the press
for their cooperation in honoring tenets of your institution to
retain the anonymity of your members.


<p>
<b>Mr. Bill W:</b> &nbsp;  I thank them, too, with you.


<p>
<b>Senator Hughes:</b> &nbsp; Thank you very much, Bill. The committee
will recess until 1:30 p.m.

Notice how Bill Wilson was trying to double the membership of Alcoholics
Anonymous there, by claiming that there were
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;maybe 200,000, for all we know, 300,000 recovered AA's on the
sidelines who do not get caught up in the active statistics,
people who have remained for the greater part sober...&quot;</font>.<br>
Bill did not say that they were &quot;in recovery&quot;; he claimed that they had
&quot;recovered&quot; &#8212; past tense &#8212; and left active membership.
<p>
That directly contradicts the current A.A. attitude that
you won't ever graduate from A.A., and
you can't ever quit the cult or you will die drunk in a gutter:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You never recover; members are 'in recovery' forever&quot;</font>, and

&quot;...we were very reluctant to do this&quot; &#8212; to publicize Alcoholics Anonymous.
Bill Wilson was lying there &#8212; a really blatant, outrageous lie.
For many years, he had been doing everything in
his power to publicize and grow the A.A. organization, including
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#early_coercion">him and Dr. Bob practicing
coercive recruiting</a> in hospitals, writing the <i>Big Book</i>,
getting magazine and newspaper writers to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Hutchison">publish favorable articles about A.A.</a>,
traveling the country on speaking tours,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk">grandstanding and getting his picture
and story printed in the newspapers again and again</a>, and even
getting a member, Morgan Ryan, to praise A.A. on a nation-wide radio show.<br>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The early A.A. members managed to keep
<a href="orange-letters8.html#Morgan_Ryan">Morgan Ryan</a> sober just
long enough for him to appear on Gabriel Heatter's <i>&quot;We The People&quot;</i>
radio program and tell all of America how a wonderful new organization
called <i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i> had saved him from
alcoholism, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ftnt09">then Morgan promptly relapsed afterwards</a>.<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And then Bill Wilson had the gall to tell the United States Senate that he was
reluctant to publicize Alcoholics Anonymous.
