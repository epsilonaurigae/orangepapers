<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

I was Born in 1952, Richmond, Va. We lived in an idyllic, middle class,
Southern neighborhood, where children played and rode bikes till dark.

<p>
I'm sure I was born with a depression anxiety disorder&#8212; probably from my
father's side. His mother had committed suicide, and later his father, and
still later, he did, too. Beside beating my older brother and sister and
Mom, I watched Dad try to kill my mother twice. At age seven, at Richmond's
courthouse, packed full of family and neighbors, I was physically forced to
choose between my parents during their divorce proceedings and ensuing
custody battle. I choose Mom.... and, to myself, quietly choose to never to
make a decision again. In my divided mind, our broken family was my fault,
and I cursed God for this trouble.

<p>
During Mom's second disasterous marriage, my eighteen year old sister , in
order to escape home, married an older man in his mid twenties who was a
pedophile. No one knew what he did to me at age eleven to sixteen, until I
finally told my family at age thirty. Prior to that, I acted out my
confusion and pain in textbook style.

<p>
After highschool I went to Boston University, dropped out after two years,
became an artist (painter) and lived a destructive lifestyle in downtown
Boston for ten years. I returned to Richmond in 1979 after an untreated
nervous breakdown. I lived with my Mom and her third husband, a medical
doctor. Among other things, I told them about being sexually abused. He
immediately found a psychiatrist who put me on anti-depressants. I
accidently discovered and read AA's Big Book. I went to meetings, picked up
a thirty day chip amongst applause. I felt like I belonged.

<p>
As [strongly] suggested, I got a sponsor and went to meetings 24/7. I
didn't know this sponsor had several suicides around him. He told me that
in order to get sober, I had to get off anti-depressants: they were dope.
Against my doctor, I tapered off. I wound up psychotic and catatonic in a
psych ward where they put me back on meds. When I got out, I went back to
meetings and picked up my nine month chip. My stepfather, a good man, tried
to tell me AA was not a good place for me. But I believed AA was right and
he was wrong.

<p>
To make art, I moved into a delapidated building in Richmond's Fan
district. I became a Big Book thumping recovering alcoholic. I sponsored
people and repeated the litany. Two years later and sober, the same sponsor
approached me again about anti-depressants being dope. He and the like
minded agreed I should go to treatment in Hampton, Va to get off of them. I
had health insurance and the AA facility was happy to comply&#8212; and kept me
there an extra month. To this day, my health insurance cost soar because of
this tragedy.

<p>
Tragic as well because I developed agoraphobia within two years. I was four
years sober and, on top of clinical depression, I had anxiety attacks that
felt like being plugged into a wall socket. I went to two or three meetings
a day to relieve this. Fearing anxiety attacks, I moved from one safe
meeting to another in hopes of not having another, but, looking back, all
those meetings made if far worse.

<p>
There is a story in the Big Book about a man who I'm sure had agoraphobia.
To me, it read that his was a symptom of a greater disorder&#8212; alcoholism. I
thought I was brain damaged and/or spiritually unfit and had to suffer the
same way.

<p>
After several years of thinking I was recovering from my &quot;alcoholic&quot; years,
my AA girlfriend at the time read an article in the Richmond Times Dispatch
that described the symptoms of agoraphobia. It also named a local doctor
who treated it. She had to drive me to his office because it was over a
bridge and way out my safety zone.

<p>
As I was terrified of anything non-AA and anti-depressants, the doctor was
very patient with me. He prescribed small doses of an anti-depressant
capsule that I dissolved in a four ounce medicine bottle filled with grape
juice. For several months, I drank one ounce a day, then two, then three,
then the whole pill. One morning, I woke up just like he said. It was a
miracle and I knew I didn't have to live that way anymore. I joined his
group and re-learned how to drive a car, go to the grocery store and
movies, cross bridges, etc. This took a year or two.

<p>
I still believed AA was my life blood. Even so, my AA girlfriend convinced
me to see a specialist in incest recovery who used psychodrama or
experiential therapy in private sessions and groups. Looking back, this,
like agoraphobia treatment, did more for me than anything AA supplied.
Still, I could not reject AA dogma.

<p>
Two months before I was to pick up my ten year chip, I had two beers one
night. It just happened. Ashamed, the Big Book thumping me picked up a
white chip and lost all those &quot;sober&quot; years. I kept going to meetings,
didn't drink for over a year, but it dawned on me that AA meetings were
depressing me &#8212;  and had been all along. I'd been absorbing something....
what?.... negative all these years and began to think, I needed recover
from my AA recovery. I mentioned this to [some] AA friends and therapists,
but was told I was wrong to think that way. AA was right and I was wrong.

<p>
Thus began many years of going out, picking up a white chip and going out
again. Though I drank moderately, sometimes heavily at night. I believed
alcohol had complete control over me. I enjoyed drinking, but battled with
this idea for years until I gave up. I believed I was going to die of
alcoholism and that was that. I moved from Richmond and live where I do
now, in a backwater on the Northern Neck in Virginia. I decided I would
make art, fish, work.... and die of alcoholism. I tried to go back to
meetings down here, but it didn't work anymore. I figured it was me. After
all, nobody put a beer in my mouth.

<p>
I met a wonderful woman and we are happy, but my belief underneath
everything: I will die a miserable alcoholic. I told her this, my history,
that I was doomed. For years, she watched me struggle, while questioning
AA's authority to predict the outcome of my life. I was just that
brainwashed even after the fact. It wasn't until recently that I began to
think about what she was saying. I went on the internet and searched for
&quot;non AA recovery&quot;. I was surprised by the amount of information stating it
was a cult and how much damage it had done to so many. It dawned on me,
after thirty three years, that, and I quote, &quot;AA is insane, not me&quot;.

<p>
When I came to AA, I had a broken heart. I was grieving the loss of the
first third of my life due to an insane childhood, clinical depression,
incest and self medication. I needed help, not a cult. Alcohol abuse was a
symptom and not the whole problem. I feel betrayed and have lost many years
living something I over learned and couldn't or wouldn't let go of. Now I
think AA broke my mind, spirit and my heart.

<p>
I have been drinking five to eight beers a night for years now. Recently,
I've been smoking pot sometimes. Even though I quit smoking cigarettes for
fifteen years, I started back ten years ago. The load of chronic cult
information in my head caused a what the hell.... you're dying, so find
what peace you can while you can. Perhaps that's just an excuse to drink,
but that's how I thought&#8212; and still do.

<p>
Now, as I read non-AA recovery stories and those who were damaged by AA,
too, I am considering that I mite be able to make better decisions than
what I have been. Sometimes I wonder.... because I believe in a Loving
God.... that status quo mankind is just one big cult bent on controlling
others by doing the opposite of Love. That opposite is fear or fear based.
I find that very daunting at this point.

Hello Matt,
<p>
Thank you very much for the story. I put it in the letters section of the Orange Papers,
and I'm adding it to
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. Horror Stories</a>.
<p>
Your story says so much. It also says a lot about the A.A. &quot;no medications&quot; insanity,
and the harm done by that superstition, so I'm also adding your story to
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. &quot;No Meds&quot; horror stories</a>.

<p>
The thing that really resonated with me was when you talked about resigning yourself to
an alcoholic death. I went through the same thing. I got so down and depressed that I
thought that there was no sense in quitting drinking and smoking again, even though
it was killing me, because I would just relapse again. So why waste your time trying?
Better to just stay stoned and kill the pain until the bitter end.
<p>
(By the way, alcohol makes you depressed.)
<p>
Fortunately, something changed. Something snapped inside me. When a doctor told me, &quot;Quit drinking
or die. Choose one.&quot;, I thought it over for a while and then decided to live.
<p>
I cannot explain what made me suddenly change my mind, but all of a sudden, death was unacceptable
and I was determined to not die that way. And I didn't.
In another month, I'll have 13 years off of alcohol (and also off of all drugs).
<p>
And I not only quit drinking, but three weeks later, I also quit smoking, because that was messing
with my recovery too. I was so sick that I couldn't both smoke and breathe, so I went to the doctor
and got some patches, and put one on, and never looked back. In 6 more weeks, it will be 13 years
off of cigarettes, too.

<p>
I really wish I could package whatever it was that made me suddenly
decide to live and really quit all of my bad habits, and stick to it.
I know it would help a lot of people. But I cannot even say what it is.
<p>
What I can say is, there is hope. There is a way out. And you don't have to become a true believer
or a slave of a cult to get better. You can be free. It is possible.
<p>
And speaking of what worked, I wrote a letter answering the question
&quot;<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>&quot;,
where I talk about some aspects of that.


<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

Thank you Orange.... for hearing and understanding my story.   I find your
story heartening and will allow it to sink in.   I think I just need to
re-learn how to trust folk around this issue.  I think at present, just
understanding/sympathetic others who hear what I've had on my plate is
enuff for now.   Perhaps the rest will fall in place when the time is

Hi again, Matt,
<p>
Yes, I can relate. After you get your fingers burned by a bunch of grinning, lying, con artists
who pretend to be in love with God,
it's hard to trust. Who isn't just running a scam for their own benefit?
<p>
Fortunately, there are a bunch of good people around. They just don't form cults and go recruiting
and advertise, so they can be hard to find.
<p>
Have a good day now.

The Elephants Knew<br>
And some will say there is no God,<br>
try and tell that to the elephants.....<br>

<p>
THE ELEPHANT'S JOURNEY TO PAY RESPECT,<br>
BUT HOW DID THEY KNOW?<br>

<p>
Lawrence Anthony,
a legend in South Africa and author of 3 books including the bestseller,
The Elephant Whisperer.
He bravely rescued wildlife and rehabilitated elephants all over the globe
from human atrocities, including the courageous rescue of Baghdad Zoo
animals during US invasion in 2003.

<p>
On March 7, 2012 Lawrence Anthony died.
He is remembered and missed by his wife, 2 sons, 2 grandsons, and
numerous elephants.
Two days after his passing, the wild elephants showed up at his home
led by two large matriarchs.  Separate wild herds arrived in droves
to say goodbye to their beloved 'man-friend'.
A total of 31 elephants had patiently walked over 12 miles
to get to his South African House.

<p>
Witnessing this spectacle, humans were obviously in awe not only
because of the supreme intelligence and precise timing that these
elephants sensed about Lawrence's passing, but also because of
the profound memory and emotion the beloved animals evoked
in such an organized way: Walking slowly, for days,
making their way in a solemn one-by-one queue from their habitat
to his house.  Lawrence's wife, Francoise, was especially touched,
knowing that the elephants had not been to his house prior to that day for well over
3 years!
<p>
But yet they knew where they were going. The elephants obviously
wanted to pay their deep respects, honoring their friend
who'd saved their lives &#8212; so much respect that
they stayed for 2 days 2 nights without eating anything.
Then one morning, they left, making their long journey
back home.

<p>
SOMETHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS GREATER AND DEEPER THAN HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.

<p>
IN GOD WE TRUST

<p>
Lawrence Anthony,

Hello again, Ctmjon,
<p>
Thanks for the story. I'm not sure about the connection between what he is describing
and &quot;God&quot;.  I think that there is a lot of confusion over the word
&quot;God&quot;, and different people have different definitions.  What he is
describing is more of a spiritual or psychic connection between living beings,
rather than any &quot;Ruler of the Universe&quot;.
<p>
Now I'm not saying that there isn't a God, I'm just saying that what this story shows
is that elephants seem to have a psychic connection to those whom they love.
<p>
Not coincidentally, people who care for and study dolphins  &#8212;  John Lilly's crew, in fact  &#8212; 
 saw the same kind of reaction when
one of the dolphins died. 
The other dolphins knew it immediately, even though they were physically separated.
(See the <i>Omni</i> magazine article about John Lilly's dolphins. Unfortunately, I don't know the
date. All that I can say is that it had to be about 25 years ago.)
<p>
Like I've been saying, there is more to this world than meets the eye.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Thank you Peter.

Something that a lot of people don't seem to recognize is that it costs about a quarter of a
million dollars to care for an AIDS patient until he dies. Every junkie who catches AIDS
uses up a lot of taxpayer money that could otherwise be doing something more useful, like
giving children better schools. Or fixing roads and bridges. 
Or giving better and free medical care to other people.

<p>
Now we are too kind-hearted and Christian a people to just abandon the sick junkies and
let them die in the streets, so that money-saving option is out. It seems like the most economical
solution is to give them clean syringes and safe places to shoot so that they don't catch
AIDS and Hep C in the first place.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Todd,
<p>
Thanks for the compliment.

<p>
I don't tweet. Twitter has the nasty habit of stealing the copyright
of anything that you post. I got disgusted with Twitter when I learned
that a young woman tweeted a photograph of Capt. Sully Sullenberger
landing his plane in the Hudson River that she captured with her cell
phone. Well, Twitter took it and sold it to the news networks and kept
the money.

<p>
So I don't tweet.
<p>
I do have both a personal page on Facebook, and a group there.
Both have the name &quot;Orange Papers&quot;.

Oh, and of course there is the Orange Papers Forum:<br>

Thanks for this.  I have been a clinician for 28 years and have never seen an
increased success rate when 12 step is paired with traditional outpatient treatment.
Perhaps one day people will be more willing to question the method and not the

From:  	&quot;Chris M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Awesome website!<br>

<p>
Thanks a bunch for all the work you've done putting this website
together.  It has been an awesome resource, and I'm glad I found it
because there have been times where I've wondered &quot;is this really
going to be the rest of my life, sitting in a church basement inhaling
second hand smoke and labeling myself a dirty drunk for the rest of my
life?&quot;

<p>
Since I read quite a bit about you and what you've done, here's a
little bit about me.

<p>
Last year in September I got into a near fatal motorcycle accident
that resulted in me nearly dying &#8212; my heart stopped 3 times in the
hospital.  Luckily nobody else was hurt.  I was, very stupidly, twice
the legal limit.  Thus ended my 7 year abusive relationship with
vodka.

<p>
I was court mandated to complete 75 hours of alcohol education along
with 2 AA meetings a week.  I had to get the piece of paper signed
each time I went.  Almost immediately I noticed I was treated with an
almost mild to moderate disdain by the other people, who were quite a
bit older than me and looked very beat up.  It was a newcomers
meeting, so I figured that would be the best place to start as I was
indeed a newcomer.

<p>
They talked a lot about &quot;dry drunks&quot; and how people that don't follow
the steps, yet remain sober and by all appearances have their act
together &#8212; in actuality do not because they are not here following the
steps.  I found that odd.

<p>
I was given the information packet with a bunch of names and phone
numbers and I was told to call any of them whenever I needed to.  So
one week I did, I nervously picked up the phone and dialed the first
number.  An exasperated voice answers &quot;Hello!&quot;.  I told him who I was
and that I was the new guy last week and that I just wanted to call.
He told me in an exasperated voice that he was busy with family and
didn't have time to talk, and to call later.  I never did.

<p>
I went to 4-5 different locations thinking that maybe that meeting
just had people with antisocial tendencies.  Everywhere I went it
seemed like Catholicism and AA were inextricably tied together.  I
found this odd, considering they say that they aren't affiliated with
any particular belief system.

<p>
I had to do these meetings for almost an entire year.  The longer I
went there, the longer I realized that for a lot of these people, this
was their whole life.  They go to church basements, smoke cigarettes
and sit in the basement lamenting their alcoholism.  It was all very
depressing to me.

<p>
They would yammer on about how &quot;special&quot; they were because they had
the &quot;secret&quot; to life that other drunks and, this really gets me,
non-alcoholics did not have.  They were better, and chosen because of
their alcoholism.  This even though they were worthless and helpless.

<p>
I've had to lose a bunch of my so-called friends over the last year.
But I have managed to find a group of non-alcoholics that don't drink
often and that know my situation and respect it.  I don't know about
you, but as for me I'd like to leave my alcoholism behind.  I don't
want to sit in basements lamenting my alcoholism for the rest of my
life.  I need to put it to rest and move on. I want to be with
functional people that go on vacations, and have normal relationships.
I don't want to have to freak out because I go somewhere and don't
have to have my all important AA meeting.

<p>
I've done the classes, attended the court ordered meetings.  Now it's
time to grow up and move past needing to label myself as something so
negative.  I don't want to be known as the alcoholic (once you're an
alcoholic you're always one, what garbage) that has to attend meetings
with the &quot;chosen few&quot; to make myself feel special.  I need to be done
with the chain smoking basement dweller chosen few and become a part
of society again.

<p>
Anyway, sorry for the long rant.  I had to do it.  I've been sober for
a little over a year but it's because I'm done with that life.  I'm on
a new chapter, not a constant rehash of the previous one.

<p>
Take care, and if you've read this far, thank you for listening.

Hello Chris,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
 You do a good job of describing the cult religion called &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.

<p>
Of course their ideas are goofy and illogical. You are a &quot;dry drunk&quot; because you don't participate
in their religion enough? Nonsense.  I just received
<a href="orange-letters367.html#Frank_M" target="_blank">another letter that nailed it</a>.
That writer said: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Again: the hubris of the movement is amazing! But the whole idea that one
could stop doing drugs in the wrong way shows that AA is not about
drugs at all.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or about alcohol.
<p>
If they really cared about people quitting drinking, they should be cheering for every
person who quits drinking, no matter how he quits.  But they don't.
<p>
In fact, I've had a bunch of
<a href="orange-letters320.html#Anonymous" target="_blank">Steppers sneering at my years of sobriety</a>,
claiming that they don't count because I'm not &quot;working a strong program&quot;.  
And
<a href="orange-resentment.html" target="_blank">I &quot;have a resentment.&quot;</a>
And I &quot;wasn't in recovery&quot; because I wasn't going to A.A. meetings so
<a href="orange-intro.html#issues" target="_blank">I &quot;wasn't dealing with any issues.&quot;</a>
Baloney. My healthy liver says that I'm not drinking, and it's happy about that fact.

<p>
You also noticed that A.A. sponsors are not necessarily good, caring, counselors.
But of course. How could they be? A.A. members cover the entire range from relatively normal
to psychotic and insane. For many of them, drinking too much alcohol was just a sign of a
much deeper and more serious underlying mental illness and neurosis and other disorders.
Just quitting the alcohol does not instantly restore someone to sanity.
Trusting such people to be wise life coaches and helpful counselors is as crazy as going to
the local mental hospital and asking the patients for wise advice.
Years ago, somebody sent this to me:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A flawed idea that AA is built upon:  The idea that a deeply flawed person
will cure another deeply flawed person.  A dynamic fraught with peril.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
You are quite right about the need to move on. Spending the rest of your life in meetings,
putting yourself down and declaring that you are defective and flawed and diseased and
cannot ever recover is a good way to drive yourself insane. Really insane. Suicidally insane.  
No thanks.

<p>
But that's a standard cult characteristic. Or rather, at least two of them: No Graduates, and
No Exit.  In fact, what you have described pretty much covers more than the first dozen of the standard
cult characteristics:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">1. The Guru is always right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong" target="_blank">2. You are always wrong.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks" target="_blank">10. Personal attacks on critics.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank">11. Insistence that the group is THE ONLY WAY.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">12. The group and its members are special.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_induce_guilt" target="_blank">13. Induction of guilt, and the use of guilt to manipulate group members.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_dogma" target="_blank">14. Unquestionable Dogma, <i>Sacred Science</i>, and Infallible Ideology.</a>

Oh well, have a good day now, and a good life. And welcome to freedom.

Commemorating 10 years of InSite &#8212; Service User Perspective &#8212; Community Meeting

<p>
Donovan is on a cross<br>

This will be a great opportunity to hear directly from someone who used
InSite as we look to create our own safer injection services here in
Toronto.

<p>
Join us on Tuesday September 23, 2013<br>
Queen West Community Health Centre 168 Bathurst St.<br>
3:30-5:00pm<br>

<p>
Donovan is a 30-something, First Nations, recovering IVDU that first
contracted HCV sharing in Victoria BC. He dodged that bullet as he was
able to clear the HCV. He remained a deeply entrenched IVDU but moved
from Victoria to Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Donovan became a very
regular attendee at InSite. He survived multiple ODs and never
contracted HIV or HCV which he attributes to supervised injection and
harm reduction services. He transitioned into sober living through the
assistance of Onsite Detox which is located upstairs of InSite and is
part of their service delivery model.

Subject:  	Sciatica<br>

<p>
Hi Terrance:

<p>
I was reading in
<a href="orange-letters368.html#veteran" target="_blank">your recent blog note</a>
 about the pain with your sciatica.  I can
certainly relate, I started having issues with it at only 29 due to a couple of
degenerative discs in my lower back.  The pain can be excruciating, so bad that on a
few occasions I couldn't function for weeks, and could find no way to relieve the
pain.

<p>
What finally worked was physical therapy.  I was taught exercises to help strengthen
the muscles around the lower spine to basically keep everything in place.  While I
still have minor pain and occasional stiffness, I'm glad to say it's been four years
since I've had an unbearable episode.

<p>
Hope it gets better.

Hello Dennis,
<p>
Thanks for the note. Yes, that is it exactly. I've also been crippled and non-functional
for weeks. And I couldn't even lay down flat on my back without it hurting.  There was no
position that was painless.
<p>
Up until the last few weeks, I wouldn't have even been able to do the exercises. Any bending
or stress on my body hurt too much. But things are improving. I will be able to do the
exercises now, and I shall.
<p>
This has been a long time coming. For the last year and a half, I've had a problem with
my hip hurting a lot if I walked more than half a mile. So I transitioned to riding a bike
everywhere. I thought it was arthritis. Wrong. Alas, it was much more degeneration of the
bones than just arthritis. (By the way, alcohol abuse can cause osteoporosis. It seems
totally unfair for it to pop up years after I quit drinking, but sometimes, that's just
the way it goes.)

<p>
Early this summer, I got a flat tire on my bike just as I arrived at the Fernhill Wetlands.
I had a full load of grain and bread for the ducks and geese, and didn't want to just abort
the mission, so I pushed my bike around the wetlands and fed all of my little friends, and
then pushed my bike home. It was 2 or 3 miles of walking and pushing, and it was too much.
Something broke or got strained, and I got totally wrecked and crippled, I haven't recovered yet. 
<p>
For a couple of months there, just walking from the bedroom to the bathroom was very painful,
and a major exertion. I'd actually plan the trips, also stopping off at the kitchen to get stuff,
so that I could accomplish as much as possible in one trip so that I wouldn't have to make
a second trip.

<p>
But things are getting better.
Right now I'm at the yo-yo stage. That is, I'm laid up and crippled for weeks, but then I get to
feeling better, so I immediately get on my bike and go shopping and go to the wetlands, and
overdo it so that I'm back in pain for the next week or two. Then I get to feeling better, so
I want to get caught up on things to do, so I overdo it again...
<p>
Up and down, round and round. I'm learning to take it easy.

<p>
Have a good day now. And thanks for the video.

<p>
Cool article:
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html" target="_blank">
 http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult_a0.html</a>

<p>
I'm curios how you came up with this checklist. Is it derived from an
accepted standard or from scratch?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Erol,
<p>
The answer is &quot;both&quot;.  I got the original idea from a 10-point checklist for identifying
cults that was published in a magazine some 25 or 30 years ago. I described
that article in a previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters339.html#April_S" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Then I read a huge number of books about cults, and extracted the common denominators of
many cults to get the rest of the items for the Cult Test.
You can see the list of books here:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cults" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-bibliography.html#cults</a>

<p>
Then, interestingly enough, someone found another cult test online, and about three-quarters
of their items agreed with mine.
So other people are seeing the same problems with cults as I do.
(I would give you the URL but I can't find it at this minute. It is listed somewhere in the letters,
but darned if I can find it now.)

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Pete,
<p>
Now that is interesting. I am not surprised at the way that the A.A. true believers reacted
to your revelations about how much money Bill Wilson took from A.A.
They believe in the A.A. fairy tale just as intensely as any fundamentalist Christian believes
in his goofy dogma.

<p>
Their reactions to your information about Bill Wilson's income was typical:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#authorities" target="_blank">Appeal to authorities</a>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Denial</a>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#bullying" target="_blank">Attempt Intimidation</a>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#hit_and_run" target="_blank">Run away</a>
</ol>

<p>
Yes, that is how cults carry on &quot;discussions&quot;.

<p>
By the way, you guessed that the value of Bill's estate might have been $900,000.
I heard that Lois Wilson's income from Bill's royalties
at the time of her death was $900,000 <i>per year</i>.
Yes, just one year, and she got something like that every year.
<p>
To establish the value of an asset like a copyright, estate attorneys have to
figure out how many more years the copyright has yet to run, and what the expected
income per year will be. Today, copyrights last for the lifetime of the author
plus 70 years, but it was a lot less back then. Maybe Bill's copyrights were good
for 20 more years.  If the books would continue to sell at the same rate, and the
copyrights would collect money for another 20 years, then the value of the
copyrights was $18 million dollars.
And what I hear is, the sales of Bill Wilson's
books steadily increased as A.A. grew, and peaked out some time in the nineteen-eighties
or -nineties. So the worth of the copyrights might be higher.

<p>
So that was quite a nice nest egg that Bill left to Lois.
Not bad for a poor impoverished alcoholic who only lived to serve others.

<p>
The actual hard numbers must exist somewhere. Bill's estate must have gone through probate at
the time of his death, so someone had to calculate the numbers for tax purposes.

<p>
Also check out these documents:

</ul>


<p>
About the events on 9/11: I can't really comment there because I have not studied that situation.
I don't really know a whole lot about it. I haven't had the time to read the full 9-11 Commission
Report, for example, because I'm busy reading things about alcoholism and recovery and cults.
Oh I've heard a lot of things, and I'm also curious about why Building 7 just fell down when neither
of the Twin Towers fell down on top of it. But I haven't devoted any time to studying all of
the facts and all of the evidence, and I don't really have the time to do it. I'm busy with
this addiction and recovery stuff.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	AA was involved<br>

<p>
At 30 I stopped drinking. I was married with children. I went to AA
because I could stop but I did not stay stopped for any amount of time. I
went because I was ready to stop for good, I was determined. I thought that
was what AA was about. I was wrong. I did stay sober for 13 years. But I
stopped going at around 7. It caused me a lot of trouble and like drinking
when it got bad enough, I stopped going. I always got a mixed message when
some people would tell me how great I was doing and then others would tell
me that I have to work the steps. It bothered me that I had to give AA all
the credit. A lot of things did not sit well with me.  At 5 years I did a
4th and 5th step. I think I did it okay, but things did not work out to
good. My now ex-wife came into the program and worked all the steps,
including 13. Oh well. The children stayed with me and they turned out
fantastic. I think getting out of AA was a good idea. It was my choice to
go. It caused me a lot of problems. AA may have not caused all of them, but
it was involved.

<p>
I did go back to drinking for many years. It did not get worse, like
they said it would. But it was still not a good thing for me to do. At the
age I was when I started going to AA, I was not able to keep AA's bs out of
my head. All of the things that Orange and others say about AA are true.
They have happened to me and others that I have known. I do not need to go
into it all, I have enough evidence to satisfy me. I would not recommend
anyone to go to AA.

<p>
I did go back a few years ago. I thought I would give it another try.
More than that, I needed to deprogram myself. But this time I did not buy
into it. It's funny, at one meeting a guy asked me if I was staying or just
visiting, I told him I was just visiting. I had found the OP and the other
sites and have read it all. But there was not much that I could bring
myself to say. I could tell that it was no use. I thought, like others,
that maybe I could help someone to see how bad it was. In the end decided
to stop and not ever go back. I do not want AA or any other 12 step program
involved with my life.

<p>
Thank you Orange, for providing the information that you have put on
your site. It has helped me and I am sure it will help others, if they will
just take the time to read it.
