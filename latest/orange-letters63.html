From:  	juliette u.<br>
Subject:  	good job dude<br>

<p>

I have just been introduced to your site and I haven't gone through it
enough but I can already see a lot of flaws. At this time I will be  general, I
just have to let you know most of what you are writing is true based  on the
current membership of Alcoholics Anonymous and (&quot;the  fellowship&quot;) They are
carrying a really weird message (supposedly since the  1970s pop physiology) and
with that I agree, all of the people whom are showing  up attending meetings
claiming to be alcoholics. In order for these people to  stay and feel comfortable
they do make it a cult and alcoholism becomes  something other than what it
is. I just want you to know that The Big Book and  its steps are written for a
very particular drunk. And this particular drunk  really has very few options,
and the steps really do provoke a spiritual awaking  and life is then a much
different experience for these once problem drinkers  whose only hope is a
spiritual awakening, if they do not have a spiritual  experience, they can go on
to drink and die or commit suicide. reread to  employers it's pretty sad but
it seems to me you are looking at the big book  very narrow minded only because
of your encounters with the wacked out  fellowship, but that is just the
fellowship to let you know in our big book we  only use the word disease one
time.... it was in 1951 i believe the federal  government proclaimed alcoholism a
disease.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Juliette,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
About the &quot;disease&quot; declaration &#8212;
Um no, that is confused.
The American Medical Association, which has no connection to the government &#8212; it
is merely a private fellowship, just like Alcoholics Anonymous is &#8212;
stated in 1956 that &quot;alcoholism was an illness&quot;, but they didn't get around to
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA">publishing an article in the JAMA</a>
that actually defined the disease of &quot;alcoholism&quot; until 1992.
The A.M.A. decision to call alcoholism an illness in 1956 was a political decision, not a medical
decision that was based on the results of research. They just got tired of A.A. members nagging them,
so they said, &quot;Okay, we will call alcoholism an illness.&quot;
<p>
Even worse, what the A.M.A. published in 1992 was an article that was
actually written by two front groups for Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212;
<b>&quot;The Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine&quot;</b>.
The A.M.A. did not actually define alcoholism and
declare it to be a disease; A.A. did.
</font>

<p>
The big book never not one time in the 164 pages of how to  recover do we
ever talk about sponsorship at all that is all &quot;fellowship.&quot; Also  I am
encouraged over and over to think for myself in the big book and I only  read breifly
about your writings on the 11th step and it's not coming from the  book you
just wrote out the 11th step made it seem all creepy and freeky but  it's not. re
read 11th step in big book.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are right that sponsorship is hardly mentioned in the <i>Big Book</i>. Bill Wilson raved about it
in his second book, <i>&quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;</i>.
So what? What difference does it make which
of the two books promoted the sponsorship system?
<p>
About thinking for yourself &#8212; actually, Bill Wilson demanded that you stop thinking and just have faith.
Bill did say that you should think about how stupid your behavior has been,
but then he switched to telling you to stop thinking &#8212; that rational thought is an impediment to true faith.
It's a bait and switch trick.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#dont_think">See this</a>.
Also see
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">the web page on religious faith</a>.
Bill Wilson even demanded that we abandon 'Reason' and logic.

</font>

<p>
I don't know why you are so caught up in the Oxford Groups and acting like
we are the oxford groups we are totally removed and seperated from that cult
and  we have always been. But there were some straight ripp off's rocketed into
the  fourth dimension.
<p>
<font color="blue">
About the Oxford Group &#8212; you are ignoring the fact that the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous <i>IS</i>
Buchmanism. All that Bill Wilson did to create the 12 Steps and all of the rest of the A.A. practices
and beliefs was
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">edit the practices and beliefs of the Oxford Group</a>
and occasionally
substitute the word &quot;alcohol&quot; for the word &quot;sin&quot;.
Like, instead of being defeated by sin and powerless over it, alcoholics are
defeated by alcohol and they are powerless over it and
their lives are unmanageable.

</font>
<p>

<p>
I don't know why you bagg on Bill Wilson so hard he did not write the big
book by himself.
<p>
He wrote the 12 and 12 which Bob begged him not to do.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh really? That is news to me. Please tell me more about Dr. Bob begging Bill Wilson not to write the second
A.A. book, <i>&quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;</i>.

</font>
<p>


<p>
any way I wholeheartedly agree with your take on the fellowship LAME! I  have
thought about it a lot and I have come up with.
<ul>
<li>
#1 they are not real alcoholics
<li>
#2 if they are they want to drink again, not face themselves completely  come
up with weird shit like turn it over?
<li>
#3 They do not want to find out the truth because of the  responsibility
</ul>

<p>

I have to let you know I am very happy you have put this site up and I hope
AA people will visit.
<p>
But I agree they are very cult they are afraid and somehow they end up in
AA. But I must emphasize that alcoholism is a spiritual illness and it would
only make sense that people will come to AA whom are not alcoholics and carry a
weird message because in the end the one whom suffers is the real alcoholic.
<p>
<font color="blue">
What the heck is a spiritual disease? How do spirits get sick? Are there spiritual
bacteria and spiritual viruses that infect them?<br>
Or evil spirits or something?<br>
How about spiritual cooties that rub off and cause
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency">the spiritual disease of
&quot;codependency&quot;</a> just by being near an alcoholic?

</font>
<p>

Oh  I also want to say the only objective the people whom wrote the big book
wanted  were for alcoholics like me to live, be super happy, to be successful
to  think... God gave us brains to use.. all without having to die from
alcoholism.
<p>
People whom are not alcholics can't really understand the big book, so they
make shit up.

<p>

once a drunk now spirtually awake, Thanks to AA

Subject:  	A Telling Example<br>

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

I've noticed that on your website you tell of Bill Wilson propounding the stereotype
that alkies are too amoral.  In fact, it has been proven that addiction are far more
likely in people whose brain biologies make them more impulsive.  Plenty of people
have &quot;dual diagnoses&quot; of both bipolar disorder and addiction.  I'm very familiar
with the impulsivity typical of hyperthymic personalities, and the following, at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321215245/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/04/uncle.speed.ap/index.html">
http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/04/uncle.speed.ap/index.html</a>,
follows the sort of
pattern that hyperthymic recklessness tends to take:

CONNELLSVILLE, Pennsylvania (AP) &#8212; A man who ran over his 2-year-old niece while
she was playing in her driveway was charged with homicide by vehicle, speeding and
other counts, police said.

<p>

Greg Gibbs, 28, pulled into the driveway at a speed greater than necessary
Wednesday evening and ran into Megan Shipley, police said.

<p>

Authorities said family members repeatedly had told Gibbs to slow down.

<p>

Gibbs, who has been living with Megan's family, was arraigned Thursday on homicide
by vehicle, careless driving, reckless driving and speeding charges.

<p>

He was being held in the Fayette County jail. It was unclear if he had an attorney.

That webpage at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321215245/http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-986382297.htm">
http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-986382297.htm</a>,
defines the
Hyperthymic Personality Disorder as, &quot;Individuals with a hyperthymic personality
disorders are persistently more happy and optimistic than normal.  They have marked
enthusiasm for life but on the other hand tend to be rash and show poor judgement.&quot;
The Merriam Webster's Dictionary defines the word reckless, as, &quot;lacking caution  :
RASH.&quot;  Therefore, you could say that the behavior that comes from HPD, is basically
reckless.  But to many people, the word &quot;reckless&quot; implies an intent to flirt with
danger, while those with HPD usually don't intend that.  What Greg Gibbs did, could
easily be called &quot;reckless driving,&quot; yet he obviously wasn't intending to flirt with
danger.  Instead, he's probably as impulsive as someone who's under the influence of
uppers which disinhibit as booze does, so he didn't notice the dangers.

<p>

Chances are that if, after this happened, you were to talk about it with him, or
with someone who aimed to lessen your resentment anger and other painful emotions,
that person would insist that you see that he had no malicious intent.  What he did
wouldn't look malicious as alcoholics were described in those quotes on your
website: &quot;instinct run wild,&quot; &quot;perverse soul-sickness,&quot;
&quot;shameful,&quot; &quot;So stupid, so
selfish, so self-seeking!&quot;, &quot;like a tornado roaring his way through the lives of
others,&quot; &quot;argumentative,&quot; &quot;implacably selfish, and chronically self-centered,&quot; etc.
Yet what he did was still as impulsively dangerous enough, that he could easily
develop a drinking problem heedlessly.

<p>

Sure, the dangers of what Greg did might seem obvious to you, and family members
repeatedly pointed them out to him, but that doesn't mean that he believed that
these dangers really did exist.  Also, you could say that everyone is responsible
for recognizing when his own behavior is that dangerous.  Yet Greg, or the person
encouraging the well-adjusted forgiveness, could respond by saying that there really
is no objective standard for determining how responsible someone is for not seeing
big dangers, so to whatever degree you hold him responsible, that's just your
self-interested opinion.  And by far most people do have a sense for why they
shouldn't be that heedless.

<p>

<p>

(Ever since I was a teenager, anyone who didn't have a chronically manic personality
seemed half dead to me, smirk, smirk.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Sharen,
<p>
Thanks for the input. What you are describing reminds me of a friend whom I think has a bipolar
disorder. When he is in the manic phase, he is so giddy that he will drive around crowded downtown
areas as fast as he can, taking corners on two wheels, and when I tell him to stop it, he will
laugh and say that he is a good driver and there is no problem. I have had to literally take the
keys away from him, and insist on driving, and he thinks I'm just being an old fuddy-duddy who
is worrying needlessly.

<p>
And yet he means no harm. He literally cannot see the danger. He is just high as a kite on a brain
chemical imbalance.

<p>
It's a miracle that he has not hit anyone. Fortunately, he screwed up and wrecked his car, so now he
walks.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Correction of Info<br>

<p>

Hey, Guy,
<p>
I just discovered an error in
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#hundred">your Akron_success HTML</a>.
You quote Wilson on
page 17 of the Big Book as saying
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;We of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, know of
thousands of men and women who were once just as hopeless as Bill.  Nearly
all have recovered.  They have solved the drink problem.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Your assertion that he wrote this statement in the original manuscript is
incorrect.  This is one of the several cases where the original text was
later edited to update numbers or to reflect change in groupthink.  What the
original multilith stated on page 8 and the 1st edition hardback on page 27
is this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;We, of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, know one hundred men who were once
just as hopeless as Bill.  All have recovered. They have solved the drink
problem.&quot;<br>

From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	It's Weakness That's Shamed<br>

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

What really gets me about AA's and Al-Anon's shaming tactics, is also the way in
which they seem to have most shaped self-help psychology, what Susan Faludi
described in Backlash.  That is, that they're much more likely to be based on
shaming weakness, than they are on shaming destructive behavior.  One could think if
this mentality as &quot;&Uuml;bermensch = good, untermensch = bad&quot;  Yet if you don't think of
loving the &uuml;bermenschen, as basically fascist, the American culture has an idea
that's very similar.  About a century ago, William James wrote that Americans tend
to classify people as either redbloods or mollycoddles.  As Schopenhauer would put
it, redbloods in all circumstances powerfully impress the human race.  Since
mollycoddles use their weakness to get coddled, they're ignominiously cunning, even
when they sincerely mean everything they say, since if they think that something is
bad or evil then that would reflect their own self-wills.  What you end up with,
both in Germany and in the USA, is that the strong are &uuml;bermenschen/redbloods so
they tend to get the personal rights, and the weak are untermenschen/mollycoddles
unless they just shut up and deal with their own problems, so they tend to get the
personal responsibilities.

<p>

What I think really shows this, is how the fifth chapter of AA's Big Book, which
goes into how to do their twelve steps, talks about their moral inventory of
character defects, as a confession of the resentment anger and fear that oneself
feels, rather than what one has done that caused others to feel pain.  Their sample
table of mea culpas, is headed, &quot;I'm resentful at,&quot; &quot;The cause,&quot; and, &quot;Affects my,&quot;
rather than, &quot;What I did that hurt others,&quot; &quot;What it caused,&quot; and &quot;Affects their.&quot;
Narcotics Anonymous even has a pamphlet titled, &quot;The Triangle of Self-Obsession,&quot; in
which the triangle consists of resentment anger and fear, though I'd think that
those who messed around with serious illegal drugs would tend to have plenty of real
self-obsessed character defects.  If you want to base a psychological approach on
shame, you'll be able to create more shame if it's based on weakness, since it's a
lot more difficult to stop one's own weaknesses, than it is to stop one's own
destructive choices.

<p>

Fundament Christians dislike Situation Ethics, which judge the wrongness of an act
by its predictable consequences rather than what any holy book says about it.  A
moral inventory headed, &quot;What I did that hurt others,&quot; &quot;What it caused,&quot; and
&quot;Affects their,&quot; would hold to the heretical modernity of Situation Ethics.  Yet if
anyone assessed by that standard, others' destructive behavior that hurt him, he'd
be told that he'd better confess the resentment anger and fear that he feels about
what happened to him.

tends to be about, is this sort of conception of personal
responsibility.  When I was in college, I knew a lot of chronically depressed guys
whose depressions no doubt had a lot to do with the fact that they'd been brought up
in seriously religious homes.  Just after I graduated, I bought a book to help me in
my dealings with chronically depressed people, <i>Antidepressant Treatment &#8212; the
Essentials</i>, by John H. Greist, MD and Thomas H. Greist, MD, which says,<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;According
to National Institutes of Mental Health figures, 20,000,000 people or approximately
15% of the U.S. adult population suffers from a serious depressive disorder in any
given year.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I then became very interested in this whole question as a social
problem, since I'd seen up close how serious each individual depression is.

<p>

Soon after that I participated in that therapy group for women diagnosed as
codependent, in which no one said anything about wanting to caretake, be a martyr,
live a melodrama, etc., but instead talked about how each woman could deal with her
own problems the most effectively.  Since the husbands caused the problems, that was
just as morally bankrupt as, &quot;No matter what caused your problems, you'll just have
to courageously change what you can and serenely accept what you can't.&quot;  As I
listened to these discussions, I kept getting the impression that the guilt-feelings
that I kept hearing from those chronically depressed guys, must have something to do
with our cultural conditioning that &quot;personal responsibility&quot; means responsibility
for one's own welfare, one's own problems.  Sure, those guys' guilt feelings came
from religious ideas about moralistic guilt, but it still seemed to me that the only
way that feelings of helplessness would evoke feelings of guilt, is if one believes
that if you succeed you're a success and if you fail you're a failure.  And just
after that I read that intercultural studies have consistently found that depressed
people who've lived in developed areas outside of the modern West have tended to
feel paranoid, but modern Westerners, whether depressed or not, tend to figure that
even if someone did &quot;get you,&quot; that would mean only that you lost the battle so
you're a loser.  Westerners familiar with depression tend to associate depression,
in general, with sometimes suicidal guilt feelings and self-blame, though actually
depressed people outside of the modern West tend not to have these.

<p>

Since we have such rampant depression, self-blame is such a big part of it and other
helplessness, and the current trend in self-help means the same definition of
&quot;personal responsibility&quot; in that if the problem is yours then yourself is the only
one who helps, that's the main theme of most of my website.  I'm trying to encourage
research and study into this as a social problem.  You might think that 20,000,000
Americans suffering from a serious depressive disorder in any given year should
stand out as a social problem, yet it's routine for ads, guides, etc., about
antidepressant treatments to give such statistics as if they're nothing more than
reasons why, as each individual gets his antidepressant treatment, he shouldn't feel
alone or deviant.  If instead, this were treated as a social problem in the same way
that many social movements in the 1960s treated social problems, it would seem very
strange to talk about millions of Americans suffering from depression, as millions
of Americans who'd better get fixed through antidepressant medication, cognitive
therapy, etc.  Sometimes I think that as some people would see all the attention
that I give to this, they'd think that I'm an obsessive nut-job.  But then again, if
our culture ever saw this social problem in the same way that social movements in
the 1960s saw social problems, they might look back to the time that we treated the
rampant depression as if the problem is inside of those millions of Americans, and
think that those who thought this were nut-jobs.

http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/VictCorrSummary317.htm</a>,
I have many quotes from
ads, guides, etc. on anti-depressant treatment, which give these huge figures for
our rampant depression, but then go on to talk about how each sufferer should treat
this as a personal problem.  Two of my webpages that are particularly relevant to
the influence that the zeitgeist of Twelve-Step groups has had on self-help
psychology, are on

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321215245/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/InAllOur.htm">

The first of these is all about both
quotes from Al-Anon's book <i>In All Our Affairs: Making Crises Work for You</i>, and AA
slogans which also seem to assume that even if you're in a crisis, you're
responsible for making your realities work for you.  The second includes that
section of chapter 5 of AA's <i>Big Book</i>, which talks about a &quot;moral inventory&quot; of
one's &quot;character defects,&quot; consisting of a confession of one's hurt feelings.  Of
course, these all include that Al-Anon comic that you just e-mailed me!

From:  	&quot;Anonymous&quot;<br>
Subject:  	some observations<br>

<p>

Hello Mr. Orange.

<p>

Just to qualify: I've been attending various 12 step meetings for about 2 years
now. I'm studying psychology and have also been through alot of medical model
treatment stuff also.

<p>

PLEASE DON'T PUBLISH MY NAME ON YOUR WEBSITE!!! (thanks)

<p>

Lately I feel that I can't just accept ideas that I hear in meetings or read in
the literature &#8212; I must think critically, logically and rationally. For me, I
want to see the evidence before I accept a theory. That makes sense to me. So,
for example, when I read

<p>

&quot;We read wordy books and indulge in windy arguments, thinking we believe this
universe needs no God to explain it. Were our contentions true, it would follow
that life originated out of nothing, means nothing, and proceeds nowhere.&quot;

<p>

I want the evidence. I have studied many philosophies which do not need God to
explain the universe and which do not indicate that life means nothing or
proceeds nowhere. Infact, especially for the existential philosophies, they
indicate quite the opposite.

<p>

This is just one example of what I'm talking about. I want to hear sound
rational argument underpinned by robust logic and empirical evidence.
Because the alternative is to abandon rationalism and to indulge in some sort of
self-serving  'whatever works' pragmatism. Scientology / Islamic fundamentalism
probably 'works' for some people, yet most people would not be entirely
comfortable with a scientologist / Islamic fundamentalist being their prime
minister / president / baby-sitter / whatever..

<p>

I work as a salesman to pay my way through college and I'm very good at it &#8212;
also my background in psychology has helped me understand persuasion techniques
very well. Here are two persuasion techniques that I often hear in meetings (not
sure if you've covered them before)

<p>

1. The straw-man arguement:

<p>

&quot;Sometimes I hear people in meetings saying that _____________________ but I
disagree, I think the truth is that __________________________&quot;

<p>

This works to help any argument you want to put across. For example, on my last
sales campaign we were selling telephone service packages. When people would
give me an objection (or better yet, I would anticipate that they were about to
give me this objection) of &quot;But its so much hassle to change over and then back
again if I'm not happy&quot; I'd quickly say &quot;You know, some people seem to think
that it's alot of hassle to switch networks and while this may have been true
in the past.. with the latest advances in technology switching networks is
actually  hassle free&quot;

<p>

Get the picture??!

<p>

2. The metaphor convincer

<p>

Telling stories to people is a classic persuasion technique. If I want to tell
you that Brown socks are better than red socks, you're more likely to agree
with me if I tell you a story about my friend who had to choose between wearing
brown or red socks and blah blah blah than if I just make a statement and
describe the relevent evidence. People in meetings also tend to use the &quot;down
and out transformed into a hero&quot; theme in their stories. They say stuff like
&quot;You know, I used to judge people in meetings and I'd be thinking in my head
(blah blah blah) but I don't do that today.. today I'm able to accept people
just as they are.. blah blah blah&quot;

<p>

convinced??!

<p>

Love your work,

<p>

<p>

(by the way, i'm still not sober and agree with you when you say that there are
some good things about 12 step meetings &#8212; I think its ok to go to them once i'm
not fooling myself about why i'm going &#8212; i'm going because it gives me a sense
of community and social support)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Anon,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
While there are some good things about A.A. meetings, I still worry that some people will
be harmed by getting fed so much misinformation about alcoholism and recovery.
So much of the rap is so totally wrong that people can't help but absorb at least a few misconceptions
and erroneous assumptions.
<p>
<a name="orange_juice"> </a>
For example, I went to my second-ever A.A. meeting back in 1988, the next day after
<a href="orange-letters24.html#electrocuted">a bad night of going into D.T.s</a>
from suddenly quitting drinking. (The first meeting was a few days earlier, when
I went to check it out and announce that I was quitting drinking.)
At that second meeting, I was still shaking and suffering from
stomach cramps and in ragged shape, but I was surviving.
I told all of that in the meeting. Nobody said anything. I wondered what I had said
that was wrong. It was disconcerting that everybody gave me the silent treatment
and had no reaction to what I said.
<p>
After the meeting, a couple of women came to talk to me, and one of them had good advice like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Drink lots of orange juice to restore your electrolyte balance, and eat lots of ice cream to
ease the pain of the stomach cramps. Just park in front of Baskin Robbins.&quot;
</font>

<p>
That was great advice, and helped a lot. Unfortunately, she also said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;That wasn't D.T.'s.
Probably just a minor reaction to quitting. When I detoxed, it was so bad that I went into
convulsions and they had to tie me down on the bed for three days. Now <i>that</i> was D.T.s.&quot;
</font>

<p>
I stayed sober for three years, and then, at a friend's birthday party where it was wall-to-wall
booze, I was thinking that I could handle a drink now,
<i>&quot;You've got it under control. Three years
of no drinking, no cheating whatsoever.
<a href="orange-addmonst.html#lizard_list">You can handle just one now.</a>
You probably aren't really
an alcoholic at all. Real alcoholics have to call their sponsor every weekend to keep
from drinking. You never even had a sponsor, and you have stayed sober for three years.
Real alcoholics have to go to A.A. meetings all of the time, and you haven't been to an A.A.
meeting in three years. You aren't an alcoholic. That counselor who said that you
were an alcoholic was probably just trying to fill her quota for the month.&quot;</i>

<p>
The saner part of my brain asked,
<i>&quot;Not an alcoholic? What about going into D.T.s when you quit?
What was that?&quot;</i>
<p>
<i>&quot;Oh, that wasn't D.T.'s. Remember what that woman at the A.A. meeting said?
<font color="#4f007f">
'Just a minor reaction to quitting.'</font> ...
Okay, not a real alcoholic. So I can handle one beer now....&quot;</i>

<p>
Famous last words. I drank for another nine years after that, until it got really bad.
<p>
One thing that I learned from all of that is:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Never minimize another person's withdrawal
symptoms or suffering or experiences and tell them that it isn't so bad.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Also:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Don't play ego games of one-upmanship.
</font>
<font color="#4f007f">
'My binges and withdrawals were lots bigger and better
than yours.'&quot;
</font>

<p>
That is just one example of how misinformation can trip people up and make things worse,
rather than help people.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. &#8212; And take care of yourself, now.

From:  	GuitarSteve<br>
Subject:  	Hello Again<br>

<p>

Greetings Orange,
<p>
It's a Saturday night and, as often is the case, I'm alone at home. Learning
to be comfortable with  myself, alone, was a skill that took me a long time
to learn. In all of my years  in and around AA the one thing that I was never
really able to do was be  comfortable with myself and spend time alone. As a
matter of fact, I was taught  in meetings that it was a bad thing to allow one's
&quot;self&quot; to be alone, as they  would be in the worst of company. &quot;Your best
thinking got you here&quot; &#8212; And other  such phrases, teach one to be mistrustful
of one's thoughts and of one's self.  It's amazing to me how AA becomes so
invasive to one's life and how AA, in  itself, becomes and addiction. I actually
found myself doing drugs AND going to  the meetings every day. I was
completely addicted to both, and remained that way  for the last year that I was
member of AA.
<p>
In two more days, on  August 7th, I will have been clean and sober for three
years. Much of  that time has been spent alone, although I have become a
regular at a local  Starbucks and for the past two years have been in an LA Fitness
gym at least 4  times a week, as well as enrolled at a local community
college. It's not unusual  these days, to find me at Starbucks after a long workout
at the gym, studying  for my classes and enjoying a cup of coffee.
<p>
Naturally I've met a  few people and developed some friendships. Still, the
thought that I'm  'different' has been burned so indelibly into my mind from
all that time in AA  that it's sometimes hard to feel like 'just another Joe.'
Sure, I did some  damage to my body and mind with all those years of drinking
and drugging, but at  the end of the day, I'm just another guy with bills to
pay and an ordinary life  full ordinary problems and opportunities. Seeing
myself as some kind of freak,  that's different from the rest of society and '
powerless' and unable to manage  my life on my own, is exactly the opposite of
the truth and extremely  psychologically damaging to my psyche!
<p>
It's common in AA to  hear things like &quot;people like us&quot; or &quot;maybe he's one
of us&quot; or the term &quot;normy&quot;  to describe someone who is not &quot;one of us&quot;, etc...
And I can attest to the fact  that if one hears that kind of talk long
enough, they will believe that they are  &quot;different&quot; and feel the need to cling to
those that are more like &quot;one of  us&quot;.
<p>
I'm trudging along  Orange, and  little by little, I'm feeling more like a
whole person. It's not easy though. I  allowed myself to be programmed for so
long, that it's not easy breaking free.  Sometimes I don't even think it's
possible to be entirely free from all the crap  that's been programmed in to my
washed brain. And I admit that I resent AA and  what it does to people. It
should be criminal.
<p>
I've been reading your  work for a while now and have found the arguments,
your research and your  thought process very helpful to me. I even quit smoking
on the first day of fall  last year after reading some of your thoughts. LOL!
I'm not giving you the  credit for my new found freedom, but I did find
encouragement in your papers  that helped me.
<p>
The way I see it, Bill  Wilson could never have done the things that I'm
doing. Bill Wilson was a con  man and an ass.
<p>
I hope that you'll continue your work. Your &quot;Papers&quot; have  been such a
tremendous help to me and I'm sure that there are millions like me &#8212; Trying to
break free of the AA nonsense. If you don't mind, I'll continue to  check in from
time to time and drop you a few of my thoughts. I enjoy the  thoughts that we
share.
<p>
Greenest of wishes as always,
<p>

<p>
Steve

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and thank for the compliments.
And congratulations, really big congratulations, for quitting both alcohol and tobacco.
<p>
Which leads to the &quot;I am different from the normies&quot; thing. It's funny, but I also often
feel different because I don't smoke any more.
<p>
I also get those funny looks and attitudes about that &#8212; <i>from the smokers</i> &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;He's different. He isn't one of us. He never was.
How could he quit and stay quit so easily?&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
You know what else is funny? It doesn't bother me at all.
<p>
And I think that the &quot;he is different&quot; thing is really a
cover-up to avoid feelings of failure or inadequacy:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It isn't that I am weak-willed and just won't make the effort to quit smoking.
He is special. He was lucky enough to be born a super-man with super-human powers,
not like us ordinary mortals.&quot;</i>

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear A. Orange,

<p>

Who are you?

<p>

I am amazed at all the A.A. Research you have done.

<p>

Have you attended AA meetings?

<p>

How did you get started and interested in such a thorough assessment of AA
and it's founders etc?

<p>

Your work is fascinating &#8212; I would like to learn about how you developed
your point of view.

<p>

Have you ever read 'Soul of Sponsorship' about Bill Wilson's relationship
with Ed Dowling? I would be interested in knowing your perception of that
relationship also.

<p>

Thank you.

Starting at the top, the first 3 questions are easy.

About

Yes, I have read parts of it, but have not read it cover to cover.
I was particularly interested in the chapter
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Boniface">where Bill Wilson bragged about his s&eacute;ances
and psychic contacts with dead people</a>, and Father Dowling discouraged him from such occult
activities.
<p>
I couldn't help but notice that, while Bill Wilson bragged about his relationship with
Father Dowling, Bill actually ignored Dowling's advice and instructions, and just went
and did whatever he wished anyway.
<p>
Someday, when I have nothing else to do, I'll have to borrow that book again and go through
it again, in greater depth.

Subject:  	Hi!<br>

<p>

&quot;Agent Orange&quot;:

<p>

Thank you so much for your wonderful website!

<p>

I quit drinking about 5 months ago, and I thought the only way to do it was
AA.  My dad and sister are both in AA and they convinced me to try it as
well.  I'll admit, at first it made sense to me, as I was desperate to stop
drinking.  But after a little time passed, and my head cleared a little, it
became very apparent to me that AA, and the people in AA, are completely
full of shit.  Everything you mention in your site about &quot;the dry drunk,&quot;
&quot;alcoholic thinking,&quot; and all those other scare tactics is completely true.
I was made to feel like I couldn't stay sober on my own, and that &quot;my best
thinking got me here.&quot;  Looking at your website, and realizing that at least
*one* other person in the world feels the way I do and was able to quit
drinking without AA gave me the boost I needed to stop going to meetings so
I can start living a normal life (one that doesn't center entirely around
AA).  I really appreciate what you're doing.  Keep up the good work!

<p>
Sincerely,<br> 
Chad H.

<font color="blue">
Hi Chad,

Thank you for the letter, and I'm glad to hear that you are getting some moral support

Yes, you really can go back to being just a rather normal person who lives a normal life &#8212;
a normal person who just one who doesn't drink alcohol.
That's okay. There are other things to drink.

Subject:  	The Gam-Anon Chapter<br>

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

Attached is the entire chapter for Gam-Anon.  This is the one that includes the
stuff about how gamblers' wives should be nice little wives, to decrease the chances
that their husbands would gamble again.

<p>

The reason why I'm e-mailing this to you now, is that it shares the basic idea of
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes">
the quotes from Al-Anon</a> that you included in your The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy
webpage.  The attached shows that this victim-blaming attitude, which is obviously
characteristic of Twelve-Step groups in general, isn't generally &quot;us stupid spouses
of addicts,&quot; but, very specifically, &quot;us whiny spouses of addicts.&quot;  This is exactly
the zeitgeist of the Reagan era, where people are simply supposed to deal with their
own problems self-reliantly, stolidly, stoutheartedly, etc., and not care about
&quot;who's to blame.&quot;

Hi Sharen,

Thanks for the input. The degree to which the 12-Step groups
blame the wives of alcoholics/addicts/gamblers is both amazing and appalling.
I'm sure that gives some comfort to the guys who are the
alcoholics/addicts/gamblers &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It isn't all my fault; the old bag also drove me to it. She should be sorry for

</font>
<p>
But notice how that directly contradicts the bragging about being a tough man and
stolidly, stoutheartedly, accepting responsibility for one's actions. What a load of double-talk.

<p>
I don't think I can reproduce the whole thing &#8212; copyright issues &#8212; but these lines stand out:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
12.  Do you attempt to anticipate the gambler's moods, or try to control his or her life?
&nbsp; ...
<p>
Many who come to Gam-Anon feel that they are in some way responsible
for the problems of their gambling spouses, relatives or friends.
Members of Gam-Anon learn that they are not responsible for these problems
and should feel no guilt because of them.
&nbsp; ...
<p>
Many Gam-Anon members need help in defining their roles as spouses of compulsive gamblers.
<p>
1.  Accept and learn to live with the fact that compulsive gambling is an illness.<br>
2.  To question or interrogate the gambler will serve no purpose.  You
are powerless over this situation.  If he has something he wishes to hide,
the truth cannot be forced from him.  Why try?<br>
3.  To nag your husband about past losses or to talk of what might have
been if he hadn't gambled will prove to be detrimental to his recovery
as well as yours.
&nbsp; ...
<p>

14.  Do take an honest inventory of YOUR character defects and work on them.<br>
15.  Come to Gam-Anon even though your husband may continue to gamble.
We understand your problem and if you have an honest desire we can help
you through our program.
&nbsp; ...

<p>
One of the questions discussed is, &quot;What is my role as an individual
involved with a compulsive gambler?&quot;  According to Gam-Anon, when
one lives the Fellowship's way of life, one can be of great help to the
problem gambler even if that person is a member of Gamblers Anonymous.
&nbsp; ...

<p>
The Fellowship believes that after years of living with a compulsive gambler,
the Gam-Anon member is likely to have developed erratic or strange behavior.
What is needed, therefore, is the desire to change.
It is important to remember that because a member's character may change
gradually through the years, one should not expect the trouble to end
automatically even should the gambler stop gambling.  Gam-Anon recognizes
that unless members patiently unlearn the behavior patterns they have
acquired over years of living with the gambling problem, their problems
will persist for the remainder of their lives.

<p>
Thus, spouses, relatives and friends of compulsive gamblers must admit
that they too have faults.  Members must recognize this fact before they
can help themselves through the Gam-Anon program.

<p>
And their version of the 12 Steps includes:
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
4.  MADE A SEARCHING AND FEARLESS MORAL INVENTORY OF OURSELVES.<br>
We find that we had to become completely honest with ourselves.  Most
of us discover that we have many defects of character of which we were
not aware.  We find it helpful to take a moral inventory of ourselves.
Among our faults we find self-pity, dishonesty, impatience, hate, false
pride, envy, and negative thinking.  Lest we become discouraged, it is
also important to remember our assets as well as our liabilities.
<p>
5.  ADMITTED TO OURSELVES AND TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THE EXACT NATURE OF OUR WRONGS.<br>
It is very difficult to admit to ourselves that we are guilty of any
wrong-doings, and much more so to admit this to another person.  Once
we are able to recognize our own wrong-doings and are able to talk about
it, we have come a long way towards recovery.  We may make excuses for
ourselves or put the blame on something or someone else.  We feel much
better when we are able to be honest with ourselves.  As we begin to
talk over our problems with another person, the burden becomes lighter
and the weight of it is removed from our shoulders.  We learn to see
ourselves as we really are.

<p>
6.  WERE ENTIRELY READY TO HAVE THESE DEFECTS OF CHARACTER REMOVED.<br>
Many of us find this step a very difficult one.  When we accept the fact
that serenity comes from within, our progress develops.  Exploring further
along this line, we gain insight.  We see that with defects of character
such as self-pity, self-justification, impatience and resentment, we will
never find this peace of mind and serenity we seek.  Having come this
far in our thinking, we become willing to be rid of these stumbling blocks
in our progress.

<p>
7.  HUMBLY ASK GOD (OF OUR UNDERSTANDING) TO REMOVE OUR SHORTCOMINGS.<br>
This step specifically concerns itself with humility and what the practice
of it can mean to us.  So with humility and without reservation, we ask
Him to remove our shortcomings.  We may find we want to hold tightly to
some of our defects of character.  We need to ask God for courage and
patience in order to work this step daily.  Day by day we discover new
defects of character.  Therefore, we need to ask Him daily for His help.
<p>
8.  MADE A LIST OF ALL PERSONS WE HAD HARMED AND BECAME WILLING TO MAKE AMENDS TO THEM ALL.<br>
&nbsp; ...

</font>
</blockquote>

And then...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The Fellowship considers its program to be a psychological &quot;housecleaning&quot;
process.  Part of this process, as noted, includes the taking of a moral
inventory, as described in the Fourth Step of Recovery.  &quot;The Gam-Anon
Way Of Life&quot; includes a checklist to help members take this inventory.
&nbsp; ...

<p>
No matter how difficult a child's home life might be, he or she can build
a better life by following the Gam-A-Teen program.  The group has both
a Recovery Program and a Unity Program.  Meetings are run according to
the group therapy principle.
&nbsp; ...
<p>
Throughout the Gam-Anon literature, reference is made to the fact that
the Fellowship's program is run in the spirit of self-help.  No one is
compelled to participate; coercion of any kind violates the fundamental
tenets of the Fellowship.
&nbsp; ...
<p>

Nevertheless, as the collective expression of many years of experience,
Gam-Anon has learned that those who want to succeed in the recovery
program would do well to follow the Fellowship's guidelines.  New members
come to see that following the Gam-Anon program is the best way toward
peace of mind and well being.
<p>
It is obvious from reading this chapter that Gam-Anon and Gamblers
Anonymous use many similar words, concepts and strategies.  It is also
apparent that underlying the recovery programs of both Fellowships are
similar assumptions about behaviorist psychology, the value of belief
in God or in other expressions of personal faith, the importance of the
Group in the recovery process, personal anonymity, etc.

Yes, it really is Frank Buchman's cult religion.

What gets me is how so many people can actually believe that garbage.

Date:  	Mon, August 7, 2006 1:15 pm<br>
From:  	h.<br>
Subject:  	A man is as happy as he makes up his mind to be<br>

<p>

Dear Orange:
<p>
A. Lincoln said that a man is as happy as he sets his mind to be.  True.

<p>

I experienced a category 5 unpleasantness &#8212; the demise of my wife &#8212; and began to
drink wine in large quantitities, almost every day.  I do not have a hollow leg; so,
I had to work very hard to drink as much as I drank.  It was not easy drinking 1.5
liters of wine after 4 PM.  For self destructive reasons, I decided that it was a
&quot;good idea&quot;.  It was not fun.  Does drinking alone, with the lights out, at night,
at home alone [except for my only friend, a cat &#8212; who happened to be a teetotaler]
sound like fun?

<p>

Well, I did that.

<p>

For a year.   April 2004 to April 2005.

<p>

I stopped.   &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;.  No AA; no support group of any kind.

<p>

After I quit, I went to AA.

<p>

For reasons of social isolation.

<p>

I was appalled.

<p>

The &quot;strugglers did not appall me; not at all.   I do have some knowledge of
suffering.  I am not expert at that.
What appalled me were the &quot;old timers&quot;;  &quot;the lights were on; but, no one was at home&quot;

<p>

This took some time to discover; but, my survival instincts were such that I that I
sat with my back to the wall.  It seems that I retained such.

<p>

I realized that &quot;something was rotten in Denmark&quot;, so I found SMART Recovery on
line.  It was a Godsend.  It gave me the cognitive tools that I needed to process my
emotions.
<p>
I employed those tools to find real world solutions; I am now living a normal life
&#8212; with all the pleasures and trials thereto &#8212; and, as &quot;happy as I made up my mind
to be&quot;.

<p>

I survived.  I did learn that I am survivor.  I survived a big trauma; I survived a
bad &quot;coping tool [ wine]&quot;; I survived AA.  I was able to make the changes that I
needed to make to begin a process of re invention.  I am no longer a survivor; I am
a &quot;liver&quot;.  But, if need be, I can survive,   It was quite a &quot;test&quot;.
But, the dues for joining a widows club are pretty serious.

<p>

One lesson:   alcohol is not &quot;medicine&quot;.  It cures no disease; eases no torment.  It
may seems to sooth the spirit.  It does not.  Alcohol should be consumed in small
quantities for one reason:  one likes the taste of a beer, a glass of wine, a dram
of whiskey for the taste.  I think that any other reason reason is  problematical.

<p>

Thank you for your site.
<p>
Folks need to know about AA.

<p>

And, people need to know about options.   There are many.
<p>
Sorry, I need to be anonymous

<p>

Regards

<p>

Date:  	Mon, August 7, 2006 7:00 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Dusty H.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Online book<br>

<p>

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>

About 3 years ago, I got into trouble with the law. Nothing related
to drugs or alcohol, but never the less, I was ordered to attend AA
meetings twice a week and I am glad to say that I have not had a
drink in over 2 1/2 years.

<p>

All this time I have had problems with certain aspects of AA, like
tobacco being acceptable (I don't smoke either). Last night, I was
watching &quot;South Park&quot; on TV.
The episode was about Stan's dad being
arrested for DUI and ordered to attend AA.
Stan tells his dad at the
end that &quot;if you spend your whole life avoiding something, then it
still has control over you&quot;. He also mentioned that AA was a cult.
This got me to thinking.

<p>

Today, I googled &quot;AA cult&quot; and found your website. I was amazed at
the information there. I have never delved much into the history of
AA. After all, that's not &quot;God's will&quot;, right. I have only begun to
skim over the information on your site. I just wanted to say &quot;thank
you&quot; for providing an honest look into the history of AA and the 12-
step program. While I would not consider confronting alcoholics
directly with this information, I consider myself an intelligent,
honest person and for one, am glad that this information is
available. Don't get me wrong, I believe that AA has helped a lot of
people, but for me, I now question their teachings. Thanks.

<p>

Best Regards,

<p>

Dusty

Hi Dusty,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. And congratulations on your sobriety.

<p>
That South Park episode
is also one of my all-time favorites. (Well of course. I'm not a little
biased, or anything, right? :-) )
<p>
You can download it and watch it again and again, you know...
<a href="orange-letters30.html#South_Park">Look here</a>.
<p>
The status of that particular episode is funny.
I hear rumors that both the Catholic Church and Alcoholics Anonymous
found the &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; episode to be so offensive
that they got a promise from the Comedy Central network
that it would not be shown again, or included in anthologies of
South Park episodes. (Although you seem to have seen it again without any trouble...)
<p>
But, at the same time:
There is a South Park fan web site that had a bunch of episodes
for download. The web site was so well done that at first I thought it was an official web site.
But it wasn't, and the downloads were illegal.
Some legal authority got on their case and made them take all of the
South Park episodes off of their web site, except for one.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321215245/http://www.southparkx.net/episodes/914-bloody-mary">Guess which one?</a>

<p>
Have a good day.

<a name="OA"> </a>
Date:  	Tue, August 8, 2006 2:17 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Cindy H.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Hi there<br>

<p>

I appreciate your work. I spent a bit of time on your site today. I am
involved with Overeaters Anonymous for my food issues and I attend AA mainly
for social reasons. Even though I enjoy the changes that have occurred in my
life over the past 4 years, I will agree with you that the AA literature has
a lot of mixed messages and does instill a sense of fear about ever leaving.
All I know is that everyone I've seen leave OA truly has gotten fatter than
when they started and I have no intention of joining them so I 'keep coming
back'. What is your take on the food programs?

<p>

Cindy H.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Cindy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I am no expert of weight-loss programs, because that was never my
problem. But here's my take on it:
<p>
The body's reaction to periods of starvation is extreme. It's as if the body says,<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Never again.
I will never starve like that again. Now I'm going to put on so much fat that I'll be able to
make it through the next winter even if I don't find any food at all for the whole winter.&quot;
</font><br>
(It's just another ancient cave-man and cave-woman survival routine.)
<p>
It's just a truism that everybody who goes off of a diet or weight-control program gains weight.
<p>
In fact, even coming off of &quot;no program&quot; starvation has the same effect.<br>
Up until 6 years ago, I was skinny, malnourished, and literally starving at the end of my drinking career.
When I quit drinking and smoking and started eating better, my weight shot up from 140 to 193.
It happened so fast that I couldn't believe it was happening. I didn't know that it was
humanly possible to expand that fast.<br>
I went from a 32 inch waist to 36 overnight. I mean overnight. Literally.<br>
In the middle of my 2nd month of recovery,
I took off 32 inch jeans one night, and couldn't get into anything smaller than
36 jeans the next morning. No joke. For real. Unbelieveable but true.<br>
I could not even get into my old jeans, never mind zip them up.<br>
I was lucky to have one pair of 36s laying around,
so that I had something to wear while I went and got new clothes.
<p>
And then the expansion continued. Now I'm a 40, and have stabilized there. (And I refuse to
let things go any further, and am even working on shrinking a little bit. No more candy bars
and junk food or other high-calorie indulgences.)

<p>
And that, you see, had nothing to do with any program. It was just quitting unhealthy habits,
eating better, recovering from a period of starvation,
and middle age striking with a vengeance, all at the same time.
<p>
The same thing can happen to people who quit O.E., and it doesn't have anything to do
with O.E., either.
<p>
Likewise, we are all getting older (and bigger).
It's downright funny for a 40-something or 50-something woman to complain that
she isn't as slim as a 20-something girl, and blame quitting O.E. for the problem.

<p>
Now I have no doubts that if somebody stops trying to control his or her weight and goes on
a binge, that they will gain weight. The whole starve/binge cycle that desperate dieters
are famous for is a big part of the problem, and O.E. doesn't seem to cure it at all.
If anything, it makes the problem worse (because 12-Step guilt induction makes people feel bad,
and lots of people eat more when they feel bad).

<p>
About the teachings (theology and politics and philosophy) of O.E., I like
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Elayne_Rapping2" target="newwin77">the take that
Elayne Rapping had on it, here</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.
