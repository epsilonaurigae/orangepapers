Most of the British Moral Re-Armament and Oxford Group members who were in the USA with
Frank Buchman decided that they would
rather not serve in the British Army and fight Hitler and the Nazis, and they did not return to Great Britain
to help to defend their country, in spite of appeals for them to come home:

BRITONS IN<br>
BUCHMAN'S<br>
PEACE HAVEN<br>
</font>
<h2> from JOHN WALTERS </h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>
An arduous 400-mile expedition from New York into the wilds of Maine has
ended in my discovery of an idyllic haven where a big group of healthy
British men, young and middle-aged, have been living happily, far from wars
and cares, under the munificent protection of Dr. Frank Buchman, of Moral
Rearmament fame.<br>
</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Driving with my guide through Maine woodlands, twelve miles from Augusta,
I suddenly came across this retreat, which is known as Tallwood and nestles
bashfully on the beautiful shores of Lake Maranacook.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It consists of a mansion, several small houses, many acres of farmlands, bathing
and boating beach, and accommodation for Moral Rearmament's private fleets
of canoes and motor-cars.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A former Tallwood employee described it to me as a &quot;Paradise where women do
nearly all the work while men laze around and pass out tracts.&quot;
He told me, &quot;Britons, some in their twenties, would sit in little groups
receiving messages from God, sing, swim in the lake and go boating.&quot;

<p>
<h2><u>Bunny Austin Secret</u></h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
First to greet me as I entered this Buchman Tibet disguised as a bookseller were two
healthy and cheery Britons. One of them gave me a tract and informed me that Moral
Rearmament had saved British people.
<blockquote>
<b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But when I asked &quot;Where's Bunny Austin?&quot; he froze up. Moral rearmers are strictly
forbidden to disclose Bunny's whereabouts.
</b>
</blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Neither would they tell me how many Britons are at Tallwood.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Upset by unwelcome publicity in the British Press, Buchmanites leased Tallwood early
this summer and ordered their New York headquarters to tell British correspondents in
New York nothing about it.
<p>
<h2><u>Hosts of Britons</u></h2>
<p>

<blockquote>
<b>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As Maine is somewhat inaccessible to these correspondents the scheme worked well and
soon a host of healthy Britons were in and out there with a Canadian or two and
many Americans.
</b>
</blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Residents in Augusta and other Maine towns were bewildered when Buchman suddenly
announced Tallwood to be &quot;America's first school for building civilian morale.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was also described as a defence school, and from it British and American
Buchmanites would dart out morally to rearm Maine's good citizens, claiming this
would add strength to American's defence.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Tomorrow I'll make more revelations regarding the life of Britons in their peace-haven.<br>

The MRA members in the USA got Senators Harry S Truman (D-MO) and Arthur Capper (KS)
to send telegrams to the British Foreign office, declaring that the British MRA members were
involved in important defense work in the USA (which was actually just putting on jingoistic shows),
and should not be called back to Great Britain to serve in the military services.
Arthur Strong documented this exchange of letters:

While at Lake Tahoe, Ray Foote Purdy received a letter from Senator Harry S Truman,
written from the United States Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, Washington D.C.,
which said:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I am pleased to hear from you and to receive the program for the Moral Re-Armament week
in San Francisco. I am most happy to have it.



<p>
You have hit the nail on the head when you say that it is going to be necessary to
make tremendous sacrifices for the defense of democracy. &nbsp; ...
<p>
It will require a complete moral reawakening to stem that tide. I always talk to the
taxi drivers when I ride with them, and I find a large number of them, and a large
number of other people I talk with, are favorable to a dictatorship. That's not
Americanism, but the result, I think, of Fifth Column activities, and I am not an
alarmist in that regard.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>[There was just something so terribly ironic about Senator Harry Truman
writing to the Buchmanites, complaining about those un-American people
who favored a dictatorship, and hoping that Frank Buchman's jingoistic
flag-waving shows would solve that problem, and then helping the British
Buchmanites to dodge the draft.
Sen. Truman was apparently totally ignorant of Frank Buchman's real
philosophy and history &#8212; praising Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler,
hanging out at Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies,
advocating Christian Fascist dictatorships running the whole world, and
wanting to bring America under the &quot;true dictatorship of the living
God&quot;, where &quot;inspired democracy&quot; meant that you followed
the leader's orders without question, and never voted on anything...]</i>

Frank Buchman also appears to have had delusions of grandeur, or at least a
very bad case of denial and Pollyanna's optimism. When he
and his group were reduced to living in poverty in a remote campground in the
backwoods of Maine, Buchman used grandiose
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#spin">spin-doctoring</a>

The British draft law had a special exemption for men who were &quot;lay evangelists
of established religions&quot;.
Many of the British members of the Oxford Groups and Moral Re-Armament tried to claim
that exemption.
In September and October of 1941, Members of Parliament debated in
the House of Commons whether the Oxford Group members qualified as
&quot;regular ministers of a religious denomination&quot;.

Labor Minister Bevin's decision not to exempt wholetime workers of
the Oxford Group (MRA) from the draft.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Before the House of Commons voted on this yesterday (Tuesday)
170 members had signed an appeal favoring the exemption of the Oxford
Group. But a spirited speech by the writer A P Herbert (who is Oxford
University's member in Parliament) swung them the other way.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Herbert said the Buchmanites' methods were fascist-like and their
evangelists Nazi-like.&quot;<br>

For a while, Frank Buchman's British followers
who were in the U.S.A. were beyond the reach of the British draft, and were
relatively safe from the British draft because of the aid of Senators Truman and Capper.
But as the war progressed, the U.S.A. adopted a policy of also
drafting foreign nationals from allied countries like Great Britain.
In 1943, when 28 'life-changers' &#8212; &quot;twenty-five British citizens,
one Canadian, one Norwegian, and a Dane &#8212; all of whom had registered
with the Selective Service Board in New York City, were classified
1-A for draft induction into American military service&quot;,
the MRA people objected and dropped big names and pulled strings with
the rich and powerful, trying to get exemptions for their members.
Among those who exerted pressure on the draft board to exempt the
Oxford Group members were Congressman James W. Wadsworth (R,NY),
Senator Harry S Truman (D,MO),
Maj. Gen. Lewis Hershey, who was the National Director of Selective Service,
and Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who declared that,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;These men are working long hours without pay in an effort to show
all people that everyone has got to do his part to win the
war.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt036">36</a></sup></font><br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>But notice Richard Byrd's assumption that the Oxford Group and MRA members were
entitled to choose for themselves which safe and cushy job they would do during the war &#8212;
actor, singer, dancer, set designer, or stage electrician.
<p>
And to argue that the MRA men
were somehow especially virtuous because they were working without pay was absurd
&#8212; the guys who were ducking bullets in combat weren't getting paid much, either.</i><br>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Besides, were they really literally working without pay, or were they
getting stipidends and donations from unseen sponsors and supporters?
You know, <i>&quot;Where God Guides, He Provides&quot;</i>...)
</font>

<p>
On January 4, 1943, Brigadier General Ames T. Brown,
the New York State Conscription Director, reluctantly, under much pressure,
ordered the cases of the twenty-eight MRA members reopened. He called the
behind-the-scenes manipulations &quot;most despicable&quot;.

<h3>&quot;GROUP&quot; FIGHTS TO DEFER 25 BRITONS</h3>
NAMES of leading Congressmen and several high U.S. conscription
officials have been used in manoeuvres to keep twenty-five young
British Buchmanites out of the American Army, states the New York
<i>World Telegram</i> tonight.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
These Britons, with three other men, who are not American citizens,
have been classified 1A by their local conscription boards. This means
that they are due to enter the Army soon.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
But, says the &quot;World Telegram,&quot; pressure has been improperly
brought upon the New York State conscription director, Brigadier-General
Ames Brown, to have their cases reviewed, apparently with a view to
further exemption.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
Brown, although consenting to have these cases re-examined, called them
&quot;most despicable.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
Among the names on the list is &quot;H. W. Austin.&quot;
That is apparently [the famous Davis Cup tennis player] Bunny Austin,
who a few months ago was in the Southern States under the name of
Anthony Smith.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
According to the <i>World Telegram</i> an Oxford Group official
told the local Draft Board officials that the move leading to the
latest re-opening of a case had been &quot;suggested&quot; to him
by Congressman James Wadsworth, co-author of the Conscription Act,
whom he said, gave him a &quot;letter of introduction&quot;
to General Brown.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
One Conscription Board refused an appeal to reopen a case and said the
records showed &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
Referring to the Group, the chairman of the Board said:
&quot;Whatever its profession, it is employing influence, political
and otherwise, outside the Selective Service system and behind the
back of the local board, to bring about interferences with the
course of immigration law and Selective Service law.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;
The first case reopened concerned a 23-year-old Englishman, Terence
Blair, for whom deferment was sought on the grounds that he was
indispensable for handling the lighting, stage design, and scene
painting for a show called &quot;You Can Defend America.&quot;<br>

Frank Buchman's followers claimed that they were essential
to the war effort and the national defense;
that America <i>really needed</i> their morality plays
and shows, so they shouldn't get drafted into the Army.
The draft board wasn't at all
impressed with the chicken-hawk arguments of the Moral Re-Armament men,
and the Appeal Board in New York upheld the decisions of the local draft boards,
and the men in question were ordered to report for
induction.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt016">16</a></sup></font>
Most all of the draft-dodging MRA men
soon found themselves drafted, shorn, and marching in uniform
right alongside their less-religious neighbors. All except for Frank
Buchman, that is; he was far too old to draft; he was 63 in 1941.
<p>
 &#8212; And except for the young, strong, British photographer Arthur Strong,
who took most of
<a href="orange-rroot510.html">the wartime photographs</a> of Moral Re-Armament.
We don't get a clue about how he managed to stay out of the service.

&#8212; And except for Peter Howard, who somehow managed to sit out the war in rural England.
In 1930 and 1931 Peter Howard,
a former captain of the English national rugby team,
had been young, strong and athletic enough to be one of the
leaders of Sir Oswald Mosley's fascist goon squad,
fighting in pitched battles with the leftists in the streets of English
cities, but in 1940 Howard was somehow able to beg off and avoid service in the British Army.
He claimed to be crippled by a congenitally deformed foot.
<p>
The back flap of the dust cover of his book, <i>&quot;Frank Buchman's Secret&quot;</i> declares:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Peter Howard was for many years one of the most influential political columnists in
Fleet Street. He captained England at Rugby football and represented Britain in the
Olympics on the bobsled.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Peter Howard was actually athletic enough to go to the Olympics?
But when it came time to defend Britain and fight against Adolf Hitler and the Nazis,
Peter Howard was suddenly a cripple, unable to serve?
<p>
Peter Howard played gentleman farmer on a tiny plot of rural land in England
all through World War II. He even got two German prisoners of war to do the work for him.

<p>
Then, the Buchmanites had the gall to manufacture a stream of publicity
photographs that featured MRA men posing prominently in uniform, declaring
that they were very patriotic, and they had always been eager to serve
their country &#8212; that it had all just been a minor misunderstanding that
was exploited by their &quot;enemies&quot; to make them look bad.

<p>
Finally, after all of that, MRA brazenly lied and rewrote history and claimed that
their &quot;enemies&quot; had been conspiring to keep MRA men out of the service, and that
MRA men had to fight to get into the service.

Later, in September of 1944, with victory in Europe in sight,
the <i>Sunday Pictorial</i> (of London) said of Frank Buchman's British followers,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h2>We Don't Want Them BACK!</h2>
<p>
<b>In a few months' time we'll be putting up an outsize in banners
bearing the words &quot;WELCOME HOME.&quot;</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Under that sign we'll extend a big hand to all the husbands,
sons, and gentlemen from Britain who have been doing a great job
everywhere to help win the war.
<p>
So before the excitement begins,
and while we can still think clearly,
I would like to jog your memory about a few of the fellows who
can count themselves out from the salutation &quot;welcome home&quot;.

&nbsp; ...
<p>
<font face="Times,Roman">
[Then the newspaper printed pictures of Bunny Austin and Mackintosh, and finished
the article with:]
</font>
<p>
<b>When Britain was in deadly peril they left their country
to her fate. Now, when it's safe, no doubt they're getting ready to return.
But they would do well to heed this warning.</b>
<p>
... &nbsp; <b>We don't want YOU back either.</b><br>

At the end of the war, true to form, the Buchmanites pulled strings with generals who
were sympathetic to the MRA cause, and got early discharges from the armed forces.
