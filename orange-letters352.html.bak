hi there. ok, so i am trying something thats been hard for me in the past 24 years.
spent alot of that time going in and out of the na and aa programs. lately though i
have cut everyone out because its been the only way i feel like i wont get tangled
up in the na's and aa's drama and to be honest, harm. i do smoke green and i have
only had one night of a few drinks and before i would never of thought i could go
out and just be ok with it without believing i am destined and doomed to spend my
life in jail, some other instituion or death. i havent been able to really hear more
about the history of narcotics anonymous. a lot on aa and it makes sense to me. but i
would like to know if na has a simular history like aa does. any na &quot;bill w.'s?&quot; its
hard to just shift gears, though, going from that life to a different path. feel a
bit alone but am meeting new folks that aren't cuaght up in the 12 st recovery
bulllshit. anyhow, i appreciate the truth being brought to light about aa and bill
w., so thanks again for the hope that things dont have to be like they use to be.

<p>
sorry i type fast here so i tend to go on to long. lol, ok, thanks

Hello Eliza,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are breaking free. Of course you are experiencing
a kind of &quot;culture shock&quot; from your new freedom, but that discomfort will pass.

<p>
I don't think that the founders of N.A. were as spectacular as Bill Wilson. I haven't heard much about them,
other than that they were some A.A. true believers who thought that they should adapt the A.A. program
to use on drug addicts.
Obviously, they were not the kind of narcissistic megalomaniac that Bill Wilson was.
More like &quot;me too&quot; wanna-bees.

<p>
It is good that you are creating a new circle of friends outside of the 12-Step world. That is one of the
hardest parts of exiting from a cult &#8212; the loneliness, the sudden loss of that encircling group of people.
Suddenly you are out there on your own.  But you will find new friends, and saner ones too.

<p>
Have a good day now.
<p>

From:  	&quot;Anonymous&quot;<br>
Subject:  	My life nearly obliterated thanks to the AA Cult<br>

<p>
Hey Orange,
<p>
 I had to break my silence and email you my story. Because if my
story can save another life from the insane, depraved and disgusting cult
that is Alcoholics Anonymous, a cult which nearly destroyed my life, my
families life and the lives of countless others I witnessed the cult
destroy firsthand, then I will sleep better at night.

<p>
I drank Alcohol and smoked Pot recreationally through two years of college
at the University of Redlands. I was an honor student with a 4.0 GPA in
nearly all my courses. I made the decision to leave at the end of my second
year of college (despite my academic performance) for two reasons, one was
that I was not making a decent living as a Journalist (Honors English
Major) and two, the hard drug use was (and still is) rampant in San
Bernandino. All my best friends in college (mainly in the hippie circle,
all honor students) became hooked on Heroin, Cocaine and Meth. I was
offered these drugs constantly and never once gave in to peer pressure
despite constant and easy access to any drug I wanted (and it was fucking
constant).

<p>
I saw the damage the hard drugs did to my friends and with a heavy heart,
moved back in with my parents. I also made the immediate decision to cut
back to $60.00 worth of Pot every 2 weeks. It was not enough. Despite
working all day and night at school in addition to a full time job at
Macy's and getting into a committed relationship my brothers wife was in
AA. One night she smelled Pot on my clothes and told my parents and my
girlfriend, despite the fact that I was not high that night and hadn't been
for the last week I had forgot to wash my clothes that week and the results
did not turn in my favor. My parents found a small stash of Pot I had in
one of the cupboards and all hell broke loose. Little did I know I would
come to understand the definition of hell through AA...

<p>
My parents took everything from me, they forced me to quit my job so I
could &quot;concentrate on schoolwork&quot; which I was already fucking doing, took
all my money away, took my car away and gave it to my brother (who also
smokes Pot) and installed a security system in the house so I had no
privacy whatsoever, all because my brothers wife told my parents I was a
drug addict, which they believed with little to no evidence except for the
small amount of Pot they found. Arguments and false accusations were flung
at me with reckless abandon and I began drinking even more to alleviate my
pain. One night I puked all over the house and an intervention was held on
me the next day and by the end of that day, I was in my first rehab (12
Step based of course aren't they all?)

<p>
Within the first few days of treatment they proceeded to tell me that I was
a chronic hopeless alcoholic and drug addict. I knew that I wasn't but my
parents were threatening to cut me off if I didn't stay in treatment and
the only way to stay was to admit to being an alcoholic and an addict, so I
did. I began attending AA meetings and very quickly I felt that something
was horribly wrong. Everyone began pressuring me to get a sponsor from the
moment I walked in, so I got one after the meeting to shut them up. Not one
meeting later, this sponsor was picking physical fights with newcomers and
I heard he was a notorious 13th stepper on top of it. The greatest part? He
had 20 years in the program. I should have got the fuck out right then and
there, but my fear of my family at that moment was so great I simply
started getting sicker and sicker.

<p>
Then came the rounds of Sober Livings, all 12 Step based and each one more
insane and depraved then the last. The first one I went to had the sober
living managers growing Pot in the backyard and shooting Speed in
bathrooms, bringing in Prostitutes by the dozen. You heard this correctly,
and we held 12 Step based meetings while everyone including the managers
was getting loaded. After a few months drinking and being surrounded by
this insanity I decided I had better continue school. Once again despite
easy access to drugs I made the responsible choice and I was immedietly
punished for it. I went to a sober living called Axis where they immedietly
labeled me a pathological liar, a chronic relapser, a drug crazed
belligerent animal and completely hopeless. I quickly started believing
them and I became worse by the day. All I learned in all the AA, CA, NA
meetings were 99% different ways to get loaded as to &quot;identify&quot; with
newcomers most all meetings talk about drinking Alcohol and doing Drugs
24/7 (and they expect this will help people STOP using Drugs? What a load
of fucking bullshit!!!)

<p>
I was introduced to a synthetic drug (in a fucking NA Meeting of all
places) called K2 Spice. I went on a weeklong binge to drown the insanity,
pain and lies that the 12 Step Cult was feeding into me. Eventually I was
caught and kicked out on the streets. I made my way to Axis West Rehab and
admitted myself, where I was treated even fucking WORSE! They basically
told me and my family that I was completely hopeless and my parents could
expect to find me in a body bag. WHAT KIND OF SICK DEMENTED HEALTH
INSTITUTION TELLS PEOPLE THIS?!?! AA does, it comes as natural to the cult
as breathing.

<p>
<a name="suicide"> </a>
And despite this utter lie, I went on to achieve a year clean and sober,
worked all 12 Steps, took commitments, sponsored other people. You name it,
I did it, AA asked me to jump? I said how fucking high. I had no fucking
life whatsoever. I had no job and didn't even have time to return to school
because my whole existence revolved around attending meetings, attending
step studies, sponsoring newcomers (I didn't believe anything I was fucking
telling them) and watching as friend after friend relapsed, some of them
dying. It was disgusting and no one at AA gave two fucks about any of my
friends, the second they relapsed they talked about them like gossiping
predatory vultures and cut them out of the Cult immediately. Thank God! Most
of my friends never returned, the unfortunate ones who did some of them are
not alive today, one cut himself with razor blades in an AA meeting
bathroom. And two months after my &quot;AA Anniversary&quot; I myself attempted
suicide and drank again. I couldn't even bear to invite my parents to see
me take a cake because I had lost all desire to live. My sober living let
me stay for 89 days despite the fact that I drank but proceeded to treat me
like a dog. My sponsor lied to me and said that he and my family was going
to drive me to Skid Row if I didn't clean the entire Sober Living with a
toothbrush, do 200 hours of community service a week and write thousands
upon thousands of words for the most trivial of mistakes such as leaving a
cup out or not believing stupid cult bullshit (and they would assign me the
harshest punishments and give me the most abuse because I thought
differently from everyone else, sounds like a FUCKING CULT TO ME!!!!).

<p>
I was then kicked out of my Sober Living onto the streets again because get
this bullshit, one of the house members accused me of stealing his money,
after I returned money to him that I found in our room because he said he
had lost it. WHAT IN THE FUCK?!?! Not only this but they kicked me out
without giving me any of my Anti-Depressants or ANY medication for that
matter! Fucking Barbarians!!! My parents called me on my cell phone (which
my house had confiscated from me until I was kicked out) crying and begging
me to come home, saying that they were sorry for everything they had put me
through. I was crying too, and said I was so sorry for not being honest
with them about my situation earlier. Before I could get home I was beaten
and mugged on the streets and proceeded to go on a week long binge before
voluntarily checking myself in to a detox.

<p>
My life is finally getting better. I'm entering school to study Music, and
me and my parents have never been closer. I'm honest and open with them
today, something I could never be when I believed I was an Alcoholic and a
Drug Addict as Alcoholics Anonymous so vehemently had me believe. I still
drink and use on weekends but my power has returned to me and I am no
longer powerless, through a wonderful man named Dr. Robert Bray and a new
recovery process called Thought Field Therapy (TFT for short) that uses
Advanced Acupuncture points on the body to remove stress, PTSD and anxiety,
all three issues of which I have come to terms with, as well as having
accepted personal responsibility for my actions, something the AA Cult
ensures you never do.

<p>
If you have a drinking or drug problem and the courts give you a choice of
treatment or jail, choose jail if the treatment is ANYTHING 12 Step Based
as you will save yourself from the literal HELL of the AA web of lies and
death.

Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Thank you very much for the story. That says a lot. I'm adding it to
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. Horror Stories</a>.
<p>
There just seems to be no limit to the quackery and depravity that can result when
mentally-ill alcoholics, addicts, and convicts are considered to be qualified healers,
entitled to treat an undefined &quot;spiritual disease&quot;, and given free
tyrannical reign over a group of coerced patients.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you have escaped from the madhouse. I wish you well, and hope your
future life is much more pleasant.
<p>
I had never heard of Dr. Robert Bray and a new
recovery process called Thought Field Therapy (TFT for short).  I'll have to check that out
and learn more. I'm definitely glad to hear that he is treating PTSD. I think that a lot
of survivors of 12-Step &quot;therapy&quot; are suffering from PTSD.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Re: Another Bullshit Comment from the Peanut Gallery<br>

<p>
Well, I've sent my laptop to Best Buy for repairs yet again, and today, they gave
unquestionable proof they don't know what they're doing. My brother just called to
tell me that they said the laptop was full of viruses. My Linux laptop. No Windows
on there, unless they managed to access the XP VM. If I were more of a gambling
sort, I would bet money that the start-up sequence showing console output freaked
them out.

<p>
Sorry to hear about your own trouble with Hostmonster. They must be drinking buddies
with Best Buy. As for Tom's letter, I would be happy to mail you a check once I'm in
a good financial position to do so.  I only have $50 to my name right now.

<p>
And good find with the tablet there. Mine is more powerful, as you can expect, with
a Snapdragon S4 1.5 GHz ARM processor and 2 GB RAM, but it is much more expensive.
It does have 32 GB of internal storage, but over half of that is taken up by Windows
RT (Microsoft cannot write a lightweight OS to save their life, and I do think they
honestly tried). Fortunately, it does have a microSD slot, so I bought a 32GB
microSDHC card for it. I thought about going for the 64GB microSDXC, but I decided I
can upgrade later and give this card to either my DS flashcart or my mp3 player.
This is the best card those things can support.

<p>
Windows RT's shortcomings are quite apparent now. The walls on the walled garden do
not seem to be very high. I've seen very questionable apps, including Minecraft
knockoffs and blatant pirated versions of popular book series. I'm convinced
Microsoft's standards for the store is literally &quot;not malware&quot;. They really need to
be stricter with it.

<p>
Still, I've set up Plex on both my desktop and my tablet, so I can stream music and
videos from my desktop anywhere I go now. And with the jailbreak, I have SSH and
VNC, so I can access my desktop easily. I even used a script to enable Flash on all
websites, rather than the ones Microsoft specifically whitelisted. I can see that
they're going for a security measure there, but the whitelist excludes a lot of
legitimate sites.

<p>
Speaking of the desktop, I did Linuxify it some. I installed Cygwin on there, so I
have SSH and my favorite terminal applications. I also installed this on there:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005152/http://bb4win.sourceforge.net/bblean/" target="_blank">
http://bb4win.sourceforge.net/bblean/</a>

<p>
It's a little buggy, but the interface is great.

<p>
And thanks for the takedown on that infographic. I figured it was wrong, but I don't
really have such expertise myself. And it's fun to hear from the real experts just
how wrong these things are. Sadly, I think your response would be lost on these
people, since it's actually in text instead of being a colorful infographic or an
animated gif.

<p>
Anyhow, best of luck with the tablet and Hostmonster. And the little goslings, of
course. I'm sure you won't give them angel wing or botulism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Thanks for the information. I had not thought of trying to install Cygwin. I wonder.
I'm still trying to get a superuser terminal window so that I can just start typing commands
as root. (Okay, tapping commands with one finger.)
But I have FTP and SSH working okay now. So that's two out of three.
<p>
This tablet is funny in that it runs Linux and Android, but uses SD cards for disk drives that
have FAT32 file systems on them, which screws up a lot of things like file names and 
symbolic links. I'm going to have to experiment and see if it can handle an SDHC card formatted
with an ext3 file system. That would be nice. Just wipe out all Microsoft-isms.
<p>
And thanks, yes, I'm not going to give the cute little fluff-ball goslings and ducklings
any diseases.  Speaking of which, there is another new family of goslings that I saw yesterday,
a family with four cute little babies. I gave them some whole wheat bread, and watched
(and videotaped) as they
alternated between eating grass and eating the bread.  They have very clear inborn ideas
of what constitutes good nutrition, and they insist on eating their greens.  Not at all
like human children who will just gorge on candy if you let them.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Kevin,
<p>
Thanks for the question.
My purpose is to broadcast the truth. It really helps some people.  I just got another
letter from a fellow who suffered greatly because his parents were grossly misinformed about
12-Step recovery. Check it out
<a href="orange-letters352.html#horror" target="_blank">here</a>.
Things would have been much better if his parents had known the truth.
<p>
I hope that in the future we will have more truth and less mendacity.
That may be wishful thinking, but I hope.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	What a pile of intellectual hooey.<br>

<p>
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html</a>

<p>
It was very interesting reading this very lengthy paper.  The author's attempt to
intellectualize a spiritual experience with statistics and supposed facts was very
amusing to read.

<p>
It is often said that individuals who enter such programs consider themselves
fortunate to have experience the path of self-destruction.  For without the
addiction or affliction they would not have come to experience this simple way of
life.  More often, we share a hope that those who do not have such a way of life can
somehow find it.  You see, the program is not about recovering from addiction.  It
is about learning to live life on life's terms.

<p>
One slogan you omitted was this:  We don't have a drinking problem, we have a
thinking problem.  Our best thinking problem.  You can't think your way into right
actions you have to act your way into right thinking.

<p>
So for those who sit outside and claim the program is a failure, I wish that someday
you might feel the freedom of spirit that comes with being right with yourself,
right with those around you and right with a power greater than yourself.  Human
beings are rarely fulfilled.  There are millions who have found this way through
hardship.  Millions more will continue to run through the maze like a rat to cheese
in search of it and never know it exists.  Millions will think they are perfect just
the way they are, never knowing the world closes so many doors in the face of their
mal-adjusted ego trips.  Others will suffer hardships thinking &quot;if only there was
more money, if only there was someone who loved me, if only I had a different
life...&quot;.  Then there are those who have found it, and these are the ones you call
failures by virtue of statistics.

<p>
I am grateful and fortunate indeed to be your definition of a failure.  And the
millions world wide who have a global fellowship are also grateful.  Thank you for
reminding me how fortunate I really am.  I once intellectualized all of life's
facets.  Now I accept them and live life.  Much simpler, much less complicated,
vastly more rewarding.

<p>
A mountain of research and footnotes cannot reflect the fact that is the freedom of
accepting life on life's terms, one moment at a time, all the while watching the
unfolding of a new life that is better than most people who have no affliction could
dream about.   12-steps are not about quitting alcohol or drugs, they're about good
orderly direction in life.  None of the 12 say you have to be able to rationalize or
measure success.  No one can.  Yourself included.

<p>
Thanks for listening.

<p>
Michelle.

Hello Michelle,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. What is missing from your letter is any real information about the
actual A.A. success or failure rate in sobering up alcoholics.  Jabbering about wonderful
&quot;spiritual experiences&quot; is just a load of self-deceiving bullshit when people are dying
from ineffective quack medicine and cult religion.
<p>
So what is the actual A.A. cure rate? How many alcoholics does A.A. sober up, really?
<p>
Here is the standard question that no true-believer Stepper has ever answered honestly:

<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">

<font color="#7F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
Or even several years later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No qualifiers are allowed, like, &quot;We will only count the people who <i>worked the program right</i>, or
we will only count the people who <i>really tried</i>, and <i>kept coming back</i>.&quot;
Everybody counts. No exceptions.
<p>
No excuses are allowed. When the doctor gives a patient penicillin, and it fails to cure the infection,
the doctor doesn't get to say, <i>&quot;But he didn't work the program right. He didn't pray enough.
He didn't surrender. He held something back in his Fifth Step.&quot;</i>
No excuses.
<p>
So what's the actual A.A. cure rate?

Hello Randaron,

Actually, I cannot think of anyone, alcoholic or not, that A.A. is really for.
What alcoholics really need is true information and evidence-based treatment, not

That's nice it seems I forgot to include the animosity's of psychiatrists that
despise the fact that there is actually free treatment out there. between the
doctors and psychiatrist they would suck the world dry of all finance just so they
could place a little bronze statues of Sigmund Freud and plaques immortalizing his
cocaine crazed ideas.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Randaron,
<p>
Animosity of psychiatrists? Do you really imagine that psychiatrists are hostile
to Alcoholics Anonymous because they just want the non-existent money that the
down-and-out alcoholics don't pay for free A.A. meetings?

<p>
By the way, that is a prime example of the propaganda technique called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>Ad Hominem</i></a>
 &#8212;  casting aspersions on the motives of critics. Like, &quot;They are only
in it for the money.&quot; You have not provided any evidence that psychiatrists
and doctors are guilty of overlooking or rejecting
 A.A. treatment that actually works.
<p>
So how well does A.A. work? What is the A.A. cure rate?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

That is one hard-working mama.
She is gobling down the bread because she is famished. She had to make those 9 goose eggs
out of her own body, and then she had to sit on them for a month, and get little food
while she was doing it, so a mother goose who has just hatched out her babies is basically
starving. So she is eagerly gobling up the bread. The father, on the other hand, is
not starving, so he is just hanging back and letting the others get the food.
The babies don't know what bread is. They have never seen it before. But they learn rapidly.
They are watching their mother eat the stuff, so they will too.

Hello Orange,

<p>
First, I want to thank you for your wonderful website. I speak French and
there's nothing comparable in French. It's important that all materials are
available in other languages for help more people. It is a cult
international.

<p>
I am not a AA members, by cons, I have been a member for 6 years, from OA
and DAA (CoDA in French).

<p>
I'm looking for good information of this quality since long time. I told
myself that I should not be the only one to find some bad things and how to
deprogram me.

<p>
I have long questioned the problems in anonymous fraternities without being
able to put my finger on.

<p>
Thank you<br>

Hello Orange

<p>
I want to thank you again for your wonderful website. I finally found the
problem while reading a book from Steven Hassan on how protected sects.
This book helped me to recognize the characteristics found in the following
sects: AA, NA, GA, OA, DAA, CoDA, Al-Anon, etc ...

<p>
An interesting site helped me<br>
<a href="www.freedomofmind.com/" target="_blank">
www.freedomofmind.com/</a>

<p>
In this website it recognizes sectarian characteristics of AA. This is the
website of Steven Hassan specialist sects.

<p>
His book helped me to arrive at your site. This book I read in French is
called <i>Combating Cult Mind Control</i>. He described the &quot;BITE model and
Describes the&quot; four components of mind control as:<br>
<ul>
<li>  Behavior control
<li>  Control Information
<li>  Thought Control
<li>  Emotional control
</ul>

<p>
For more information Wikipedia page provides an overview of these writings<br>

Hello, Hirondelle,
<p>
Thank you for the letters and the compliments.
<p>
I know a fair a bit about Steve Hassan and his books and web site. I was just recommending
him and his books to another person in this letter:<br> 
<a href="orange-letters351.html#Holly_J" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters351.html#Holly_J</a>
<p>
I also have a summary of the BITE model here:<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Berkeley Revive's cult description</a>
</ul>

<p>
Steve and I agree on pretty much everything except A.A. being a cult. He doesn't think
that A.A. is a cult. I do. I don't think that Hassan knows much about how A.A.
really operates. He knows a lot about the Moonies, because he was a member of that organization
for about 7 years, but I don't think he was ever a member of A.A., so he doesn't know
about all of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">the bait-and-switch tricks</a>
and how the hidden reality is just the opposite
of the face that they present to the public.
He also doesn't seem to know what a horrendous failure rate A.A. really has.
And I don't think he knows about
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">the Nazi cult religion history of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

<p>
He also overlooks how the legal system in the USA is forcing people into the 12-Step cult
religion. That was, of course, encouraged, promoted, and established by A.A. members over
the last 70 years.

<p>
You are lucky that the laws of France outlaw cults and cult religions. I think you still have
Alcoholics Anonymous there, but at least you don't allow Scientology.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Copy of mail just sent to Dr Ben Goldacre, author of Bad Science and well known media face in UK for debunking &quot;fake&quot; science and medical treatment:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


Dear Dr Goldacre,

<p>
I thoroughly enjoyed your excellent book Bad Science and applaud your efforts you continue to make to help educate the general public.

<p>
I was wondering if you had ever had a chance to take a serious look at the 12-step based (Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous etc) recovery industry? This is a multi-billion-dollar industry taking a large amount of both private and public money in return for providing a form of treatment that seems to have absolutely no statistically significant results.

<p>
I will show my hand quite openly &#8212; I consider myself to be a survivor of the 12-step cult. I have been sober for two years now, the majority of this time free from the cult religion of AA. I fully respect the rights of an individual to hold their own religious views.

<p>
However, the prevalence of public funding being channeled towards rehabilitation centres based upon indoctrination into this religious movement despite any evidence suggesting it is effective makes me wonder &#8212; if this amount of money was being spent on homeopathy to treat cancer sufferers there would be an outcry among the scientific community. Why is this not the case with the 12-step industry? Is it simply that people are not aware of what goes on, or do I have my facts wrong?

<p>
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info</a>
 provides an excellent collection of studies and articles relating to research
that has been done in this area that surpasses anything I could collect myself.
There are a relatively small number of us (hopefully growing) who feel the way
that I do but we are a tiny voice compared to the AA GSO media machine and any
attention from the wider community, particularly people like yourself with such
a good track record of exposing such rackets, is appreciated.

<p>
Yours sincerely,

<p>
P Cook

Subject:        No fan of AA, but it is missing 2 key facets of Cults<br>

<p>
No argument about AA quackery here...However AA lacks certain cult characteristics.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1.  AA is way more transparent than a cult.  For example their financials are published &#8212; try that with Scientology, Kenneth Copeland Ministries, or a few other choice cults.

<p>
<li>

2. With the exception of closed meetings, AA meetings are open to the public.  Even at closed meetings, you can pretty much go without anyone caring.  Cults monitor there classes and meetings much more heavily than AA does.

<p>
<li>
3.   I have never seen a person tracked down if they left, like a cult does.  I have experience with many cults, and they usually aggressively pursue people to pull them back in.  Haven't seen that behavior systematically done in AA as a practice.
</ul>

<p>
While I am not a fan of AA,  I usually reserve the word CULT for groups having at least the above characteristics.

<p>

Hello Paul,

<p>
Thanks for the letter. Alas, those points are not valid.
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>
has 100 questions that cover the objectionable behavior of most cults.
Just picking out three items is not an accurate analysis of whether
a group is a cult.
And in fact, two out of the three items that you picked are not even in the test.
<ol>
<li> Financial openness or secrecy? That isn't a cult characteristic.
Try to get the truth from Goldman Sachs or Olympus Corporation.
<li>  Open meetings? Try to visit the White House and sit in on a cabinet meeting. Or a Vatican meeting of Cardinals.

<li> Stalking defectors? Now you are getting close.

Extreme possessiveness of members is
a cult characteristic. However, this is highly variable, and is different from cult to cult.
Most cults just let you walk away, because most people do just that.
All cults have very high dropout rates, and they cannot waste all
of their time chasing defectors.

</ol>

<p>
Now, about A.A.:
<p>
<ol>

<li>
Both Alcoholics Anonymous and Scientology reveal the same financial information,
because they are required to file Form 990
with the IRS to maintain their tax-exempt status.
I doubt though, that either of them is telling the truth in their numbers.
<p>
It only took me about 10
seconds with Google to find a lot of information about the Scientology
Form 990 filings.
Try googling &quot;Form 990 for Scientology&quot;.
You will get a bunch of links, including:

<ul>
<p><li>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005152/http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/corporate/990s.php?ntt=175" target="_blank">
http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/corporate/990s.php?ntt=175</a>

<p><li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005152/http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/corporate/990s.php?ntt=276" target="_blnk">
http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/corporate/990s.php?ntt=276</a>

<p><li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005152/http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/01-0477609/church-scientology.aspx" target="_blank">
http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/01-0477609/church-scientology.aspx</a>

</ul>

<p>
There is plenty of information about the A.A. filings too. What is particularly
relevant is the fact that the A.A. filings are untrue and perjurous.
Former General Manager Greg Muth was playing fast and loose with the A.A. money.
When I questioned why A.A. was paying their EDP manager Lillianna Murphy 
 $175,742.00 per year,
she saw it and wrote to me and said that she was not paid even half that
much. So Greg Muth was rerouting money to somebody else's pocket
and claiming that it went to the EDP manager. That is felony fraud
and embezzling.
Then Greg Muth gave $469,000 of A.A. money to his lawyer
friend Tom Jasper as a going-away present. Muth has never adequately explained
that.


<p>
Also see this information about the finances:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters65.html#AA_financials2" target="_blank">
Analysis of Form 990 for the year 2004.


<li> <a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Salaries of A.A. leaders</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters117.html#Lillianna" target="newwin112">Former EDP Manager for A.A.
Lillianna Murphy wrote to me</a>
and said that she didn't get even half of the money that Greg Muth reported on the Form 990.
So somebody else took that money home.

<li> <a href="orange-letters248.html#ANONYMOUS" target="_blank">More on A.A. headquarters finances</a>,
including copies of all of the recent Form 990 filings.
</ul>

<p><li>
Open meetings? That's nothing. Every cult I ever visited had open meetings,
and there were a lot of them.
They were even eager to get you to attend their meetings. That's how they
recruit.
And yes, they have lots of meetings. They want you to come and chant with
them, or meditate, or do Bible Study, or yoga, or &quot;motivational meetings&quot;,
or whatever. It's always something.


<p><li>
Stalking quitters and defectors? While I agree that A.A. true believers don't
always do it, and nobody came after me when I quit A.A.,
I've received a lot of stories where people
complained about just that. Here are some of them:
<ul>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters121.html#horror2" target="_blank">
I have SUFFERED many a &quot;consequence&quot; for leaving A.A., from
employment and professional losses to down right stalking (God forbid
you try to leave).</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters344.html#David_G" target="_blank">
AA is seriously a Cult. I have been stalked and like I said you would not
even believe me the shit I have had to put up with because I was vocal
about how over the top AA has gotten.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters14.html#Living_Dead" target="_blank">
...they decided to &quot;intervene.&quot;
In the evening I heard numerous individuals (all women from her support
group) knocking on my door and windows.  I ran in the bedroom and hid.
I felt like
the zombies from <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> were coming for me.  Later my
landlord told me that my ex-pal Sandi had said they were all scared I would commit
suicide.  They almost Baker-acted me on lies.  I even heard that one was going
to make up a story about illegal drugs and turn me over to the police.  This
coming from my support group.</a>

</ul>

</ol>

<p>
Now, for a more accurate and fair analysis of whether A.A. is a cult,
you should read the entire
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Cult Test</a>,
and rate A.A. on those 100 questions yourself.
<p>
Have a good day now.

They have taken to the water, and now we can see 12 goslings more clearly.
<p>
The twelfth gosling is nearly invisible. Look closely at the upper neck of the adult on
the left. You can see the back of the head of one gosling on the left edge of the
neck, and just the tip of an open beak on the right-hand edge of the neck.
That isn't the same gosling; that is two.
And you can see the top of the back of the second gosling behind the top of the
back of the first.  Some people have said that this family has 13 goslings.
They may have miscounted, or there may be another gosling hidden. We shall see.

I love your site.  Wow...so much information!

<p>
I am in court ordered therapy and have a counselor who insists she can
mandate me to attend AA specifically.  I'm thinking she cannot but I am
conflicted whether to argue or go along.  Those meetings are so intuitively
wrong on so many levels (which you outline so well).
I so look forward to reading the forums and learning more about my rights.

<p>
Thanks!!

Okay Sharon, you are in. Welcome.<br>
I want to send you a longer answer, but it will take a little while to get
together.<br>
For now, let me say that Stanton Peele has a book &quot;Resisting 12-Step
Coercion&quot;,
which I believe is now a free download on the Internet.<br>

Hello again, Sharon,
<p>
I wanted to add this information:

<ol>

<p><li>
The Federal Appeals Court in Hawaii, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
September 7, 2007, in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005152/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/229810/AA_Can_Not_Be_Forced_Onto_Parolees">the Inouye v. Kemna case</a>,
ruled that any &quot;coercing authority&quot; can be held individually,
civilly liable for the 1st Amendment constitutional rights violation that
they perpetrate on people unwillingly and involuntarily forced to go to
12-Step programs. Meaning: <b>you can sue a judge, a prison warden, a parole officer,
a &quot;counselor&quot;, or anyone else in a position of authority who
forces you to go to A.A. meetings</b>.
<p>
I think Ken Ragge has a copy of the court's ruling on his web site:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005152/http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html">
http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html</a>

<p><li>

The U.S. Supreme Court has not exactly ruled that A.A. is a religion.
Rather, they allowed to stand, unchallenged and unchanged, several
lower court decisions that said that A.A. was a religion, or engaged in
religious practices. So effectively, by inaction, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it
the law of the land.

<p>
We were just discussing this issue in two previous letters,
<a href="orange-letters214.html#coerced2" target="_blank">here</a>, so you want to see that.
<p>
Then you can read about the list of court cases on the
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank"><i>&quot;It's Spiritual, Not Religious&quot;</i></a>
web page.

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day now, and good luck.
