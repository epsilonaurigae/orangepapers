One of the standard Alcoholics Anonymous claims is that it is
&quot;spiritual, not religious.&quot; That supposedly means that
A.A. has no religious dogma or tenets, and is not in competition
with other churches. And A.A. claims that it should not be limited
by the laws that demand separation of church and state, because
A.A. is not a church or a religion.
<p>
But the distinction between &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot;
is completely artificial, and quite meaningless, and is as phony as a
three-dollar bill.

AA has been called religious for 60 years, and rightfully so, for its founder admitted as much, at
least when denying it wouldn't have served him.
<p>
Bill Wilson at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles in March, 1943:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Divine Aid was A.A.'s greatest asset.&quot;<br>
&quot;An alcoholic is a fellow who is 'trying to get his religion out of a bottle,'
when what he really wants is unity within himself, unity with God.&quot;<br>
&quot;There is a definite religious element here.&quot;

&quot;Liz, Alcoholics Anonymous is a spiritual program, not a religious one.
It is important to note the difference. Let's try this,&quot; Jerry said.
He wrote two words on the top of the easel and drew a line down the middle.
One column was titled &quot;Religion&quot; and the other &quot;Spirituality.&quot;
&quot;Let's go around the room and say words that we associate with religion
and with spirituality.&quot; The women called out their answers, and he recorded
a long list for each of the words:

&quot;Notice the difference between these two lists,&quot; the chaplain
said to the women. Liz was amazed at how distinct the meanings were for all
of them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Religion is more structured and external. Spirituality is freer, more
personal, broader. Ideally,&quot; Jerry added, &quot;religion helps you
achieve spirituality, but if it doesn't, then set it aside for a
while.&quot;<br>

What incredible propaganda. Notice that the whole drift of this lecture is
to teach us that religion is bad, and Alcoholics Anonymous is good.
But &quot;Chaplain Jerry&quot; actually has the labels reversed &#8212;
the <b>&quot;Religion&quot;</b> column describes Alcoholics Anonymous
far more accurately than does the <b>&quot;Spirituality&quot;</b> column:

<ul>
<li> It is Alcoholics Anonymous that pushes <i>confession, guilt,
and penance</i>, far more than any of the mainstream religions do:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Baptists, Unitarians, and Episcopalians don't tell you to
make lists of every sin you've ever committed in your entire life,
but A.A. does:
<p>
<blockquote>

Our liquor was but a symptom. So we had to get down to causes
and conditions.<br>
&nbsp; ... &nbsp; <br>
First, we searched out the flaws in our make-up which caused our
failure. Being convinced that self, manifested in various ways,
was what had defeated us, we considered its common manifestations.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Resentment is the number one offender. It destroys more
alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual
disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill,
we have been spiritually sick.<br>
&nbsp; ... &nbsp; <br>
We went back through our lives. Nothing counted but thoroughness
and honesty.<br></font>

 ... <br>
Hence it was most evident that a solitary self-appraisal
and the admission of our defects based upon that alone,
wouldn't be nearly enough. We'd have to have outside help
if we were surely to know and admit the truth about ourselves
&#8212; the help of God and another human being. Only by discussing
ourselves, holding nothing back, only by being willing to take
advice and accept direction could we set foot on the road to
straight thinking, solid honesty, and genuine humility.<br></font>

Yes, you won't be humiliated enough by just confessing your sins
to yourself and God. You must also grovel before one of the
old-timers, to complete your subjugation.<br>

<li> The Methodists, Quakers, and Shakers don't tell you to make lists of

(do penance). But Alcoholics Anonymous does &#8212; it's Steps Eight and

<p>
<li> The whole Alcoholics Anonymous program is designed to
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_induce_guilt" target="_blank">induce guilt</a>, and
then use guilt to manipulate people's minds.<br>

(Remember that <i>guilt induction</i> and <i>confession sessions</i>
were the two essential elements of
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds" target="_blank">the Red Chinese brainwashing
program</a>.
And Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer added
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank"><i>&quot;Induce a sense
of guilt and helplessness.&quot;</i></a>
Step One takes care of that &#8212; it requires that
members officially admit that they are powerless over alcohol.)

<p>
Seven of the Twelve Steps, Steps Four through Ten, dwell on sins,
<i>&quot;defects of character&quot;, &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
&quot;the exact nature of our wrongs&quot;</i>, offenses, people we have
harmed, and more wrongs.

<p>
And Bill Wilson just raved non-stop about
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">how bad, stupid, selfish, angry, resentful,
and inferior all of us alcoholics are</a>:

First, Bill Wilson told you, in Step One, that you were <i><b>powerless
over alcohol</b></i>, so you couldn't help it &#8212; you weren't responsible
for your actions.
But then he pulls a bait-and-switch stunt on you, and tells you that it's all
your own fault, and you have been so bad that you can scarcely make amends,
even if you try for the rest of your life. Are you starting to feel
guilty?

<p>

<p>
<li> &quot;You must totally abstain from drinking alcohol, and

<li> &quot;The fellowship isn't perfect, but the program is perfect.&quot;<br>

<p>
<li> They claim that A.A. is a program of <i>rigorous honesty</i>.
<p>
<li> They say, &quot;If you want what we have,
and are willing to go to any length to get it,
then you are ready to take certain steps&quot; &#8212; The Twelve Steps.
<p>
<li> They say that you must be &quot;fearless and thorough&quot;;
&quot;half measures will avail you nothing.&quot;

dishonest cult religion.
They just sanctimoniously accuse dissidents
of being soft and lazy and trying to avoid &quot;the hard work&quot;.

<p>
<li> The Twelve Steps are a recipe for building
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">a cult religion</a>, not a
formula for quitting drinking. The Twelve Steps are really
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">just a verbose restatement</a>
of the cult-building practices of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's
Oxford Group cult religion</a>.
Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps are not even original material.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Twelve Steps don't even mention
quitting drinking, or recovery or health, but they do mention God,
directly or indirectly, in 6 of the 12 steps.
 
The Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian religions mention God
fewer times than that &#8212; only 4 or 5 of the 10 commandments
refer to God, directly or indirectly<a href="#asterisk">*</a> &#8212;
but the A.A. true believers still insist that A.A. is not a religion.
 

<p>
<li> Again, seven of the Twelve Steps, Steps Four through Ten, are designed
to induce guilt by dwelling on all of our past sins,
<i>&quot;defects of character&quot;, &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
&quot;the exact nature of our wrongs&quot;</i>, everybody we ever
harmed, and then some more wrongs.

<p>
<li> The Twelve Steps tell people to surrender their wills and their
lives to God, to pray to God, and then tell them how to pray and
what to pray for,
but the A.A. true believers still insist that A.A. is not a religion.

<p>
<li> Then Step Twelve tells the believers to go recruit more members &#8212;
to
<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;carry the message to those alcoholics who still suffer.&quot;
</font>
That is essential for building any cult.

<!------------------------------------------
That's the A.A. idea of &quot;service&quot; to others &#8212; get
them to join Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. will perform no other
services for suffering alcoholics, because<br>

<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon
God.&quot;</font><br>

and

leave the cult</a>&quot;</font>.)
</ul>
--------------------------------------->

</ul>


<p>
<li> Some groups even read
<i><a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises" target="_blank">The Promises</a></i>
out loud at the start of every meeting, as well.
<i>The Promises</i> are just some more of Bill Wilson's deluded wishful
thinking, but A.A. true believers insist that <i>The Promises</i> are inspired scripture.

<p>
<li> Last but not least, there is the sacrament of confession. A.A. practices
confession far more than even the Catholic Church does. In A.A., you are supposed
to confess everything you ever did wrong in your whole life in the Fifth Step,
and then you continue to confess everything in the Tenth Step.
(And you confess everything to someone who isn't even an ordained
Priest or sworn to secrecy.)

</ul>
<p>
That's enough &quot;Sacraments, Laws and Commandments&quot; to choke a horse.

<p>
<li> You want &quot;Ritual&quot;? I just described a ritual. Every
A.A. meeting is a ritual, begun by praying and incanting the magical
Steps and Traditions, followed by reciting cult dogma about how the
program never fails, except for the unworthy people... Then the
ritual continues with the public confession session, and ends with
more prayer.

<p>
<li> You want &quot;Punishing&quot;?
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_confessions" target="_blank">The A.A. system of rewards
and punishments</a> is subtle but powerful.
First off, abstainers are rewarded with tokens or coins and applause and
congratulations for sober time accumulated.
Then, newcomers are gradually steered towards what they are supposed to
&quot;share&quot; when they are called upon to speak, just by how
the other people react to what they say.
A room full of true believers can be very intimidating.
They will coldly glare at you if you say the wrong things, or
smile and bathe you in warm, loving looks if you say what
they want to hear.
<p>
In addition, sponsors will either praise or harshly criticize their
sponsees in order to get conformity and proper behavior.
All of this is enforced with the threat of death: either do what you
are told, or you will relapse and die drunk (the ultimate punishment),
they say.
<p>
And, if you do not please your sponsor, he or she can fire you, and
leave you to fend for yourself. That can be terrifying to a newcomer
who fears for his life.
<p>
People who have been sentenced to A.A. by a judge or parole officer
face much greater threats of
punishment: either please your sponsor so that he sends in good
reports on you, or else you will get thrown in jail.

<p>
<li> You want &quot;Priests, ministers, men&quot;? They are called
&quot;old-timers&quot;, &quot;elder statesmen&quot;
<font size="-1">(<a href="#tsatt">12X12</a>, page 135)</font>,
and &quot;elders&quot;
<font size="-1">(<a href="#tsatt">12X12</a>, pages 142-144)</font>.
They are mostly men.
The host of High Priests starts with the dead &quot;saints&quot;
William Griffith Wilson and Doctor Robert Smith and the other dead
earliest members, and then includes all of the oldest still-living
old-timers, those rare old dinosaurs with 30, 40 or more years of
sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous...
And then the 'local priests' are the resident old-timers, whoever has
the most time.

<p>
<a name="church_buildings"> </a>
<li> About &quot;church&quot;: It is very hypocritical of the Twelve-Steppers to criticize
churches for having church buildings, and meeting in church buildings,
when A.A. then meets in their basements. But they do it. They somehow imagine
that they are morally superior to the people who own the buildings where they meet,
<i>because the other people own the buildings</i>.<br>

<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;Well yeh, they are formal, and organized, and have church
buildings, while we are free and open.&quot;<br>
</font>

That's really a crazy
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#granfalloon" target="_blank">granfalloon</a>.

<p>
<li> As far as organization goes, A.A. is totally organized and
legally incorporated, in spite
of the tradition that says that it isn't supposed to be organized &#8212;
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad9" target="_blank">Tradition Nine</a>.
Alcoholics Anonymous has two national headquarters,
one for Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. and one for the
General Service Organization.
They also have between $6 and $10 million stashed in the bank,
and they have executives, a board of trustees who each get $75,000 per year, and a national council,
and regional, state, and local offices.
Tradition Nine says,
<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;A.A., as such, ought never be organized&quot;</font>,
but they don't follow that tradition
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AA_traditions" target="_blank">any more
than they follow the others</a>. It's organized.

<p>
And on another level, there is the sponsorship system,
through which people can trace their genealogy in the tree of sponsorship all the way
back to the founders William Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith.
A.A. is all completely organized in a pyramid-shaped power
structure.
Most members have a sponsor, and the A.A. literature
like the <i>Big Book</i> and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>
exhorts followers to do whatever their sponsors say:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <font color="#8f00bf" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
A willingness to do whatever I was told to do simplified the
program for me.<br>

<p>
<li> <font color="#8f00bf" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, anonymous,
Chapter C4, <i>The Housewife Who Drank At Home</i>, page 340.</font>

</ul>

<p>
<li> As far as Patriarchy goes, there are few things more patriarchal
than Alcoholics Anonymous and its Twelve Steps, which force a
dictatorial Old-Testament patriarchal male God on us:
<ul>
<li> &quot;as we understood Him&quot; in Steps Three and Eleven.
<li> Step Seven: &quot;Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;
<li> Step Eleven: &quot;...praying only for knowledge of His will for us and
the power to carry that out.&quot;
<li> The Third Step Prayer has you grovelling before Him so much that you will
wear holes in the knees of your pants:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We were now at Step Three.</a> Many of us said to our
Maker, <i>as we understood Him</i>: &quot;God, I offer myself to
Thee &#8212; to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy
will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may
bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love,
and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!&quot; We thought
well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that
we could at last
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">
abandon ourselves utterly to Him</a>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 63.</font>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<p>
In fact, A.A.-cofounder &quot;Doctor Bob&quot; &#8212; Robert
Holbrook Smith &#8212; was opposed to even letting women into the
all-male A.A. organization back in the early days:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The young were not welcome then. The feeling was they had not suffered
enough, had not lived enough years and lost enough to have &quot;hit
bottom.&quot; Women alcoholics were not welcome either.
Dr. Bob and many early members held to the Victorian idea that
&quot;nice&quot; women weren't drunks.

Things have gotten better. Women are now allowed to join, but they
still aren't quite equal to men.
The Alcoholics Anonymous leadership is still patriarchal and male-dominated.

<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->

<p><br><center><img src="/web/20161103222447im_/https://www.orange-papers.org/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>


 In fact, nothing in the &quot;Spirituality&quot; column describes
A.A., except for the first item: A.A. does yammer about &quot;God and
Higher Powers&quot; a lot.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Beautiful flowery phrases like <i>&quot;The stars and the universe,
Earth, Rivers, streams, lakes, Blue water, and rain&quot;</i> do not describe
Alcoholics Anonymous at all. Whom do they think they are kidding?

<p>
<li> A.A. is not characterized by <i>&quot;new age, serene, peaceful,
lack of stress, centered, connected, accepting, inner strength&quot;</i>,
or any of the rest of it.

<p>
<li> &quot;New age&quot;? A.A. is based on
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Buchmanism, the Oxford
Group</a>, which was an old cult religion by 1935. And the style of
that religion is far more Old Testament than it is Christian.
According to A.A., God
is a patriarchal, dictatorial tyrant who will kill you with a slow,
painful death by alcoholism if you don't
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">believe in Him</a> and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#prayer3" target="_blank">grovel before Him</a>
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#daily_vision" target="_blank"><i>Seek
and Do His Will every day</i></a>.

<p>
<li> &quot;Serene, peaceful, lack of stress&quot;? That is wishful thinking,
not the truth. I've heard far too many people crying in A.A. meetings to believe
the &quot;serenity&quot; slogans...
And the <a href="orange-letters.html#angry" target="_blank">crabby old-timer who
angrily lashes out</a> at anyone who says something wrong
is a standard fixture at many meetings.

<p>
<li> &quot;Acceptance&quot;? Alas, that's just like the
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#unconditional_love" target="_blank">unconditional love</a>&quot;
that they brag about. See how accepting they are, or how much they unconditionally
love you, when you tell them that
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">A.A. is a religious cult</a>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was insane</a>,
and <a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps are just a
formula for building a cult religion</a>. (Just recently, I was
called a &quot;pusswad&quot; for doing that.) Official A.A. literature
documents <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_to_heretics" target="_blank">the
story of Bill Wilson driving a man out of A.A. and condemning him to death by alcohol</a>
for not believing in God the way that Bill Wilson dictated.
The <i>Big Book</i> also tells a story of &quot;the elders&quot; praying to
find a way to kick an unbeliever out of A.A.
(and presumably send him to his death from alcoholism)
while &quot;staying tolerant and spiritual&quot;.
<font size="-1">
(<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spiritual_tolerant" target="_blank">See
the <i>Big Book</i></a>, pages 246 and 247 of the third edition,
or page 228 of the 4th edition,
Jim Burwell's story, <i>&quot;The Vicious Cycle&quot;</i>.)
</font>

<p>
<li> And &quot;Inner Strength&quot;? Really now. A.A. teaches just
the opposite:
<ul>
<li> Step One demands that we confess &#8212; &quot;admit&quot; &#8212; that we
are &quot;<b>powerless over alcohol</b>.&quot;
The other half of Step One, which says that &quot;our lives had
become unmanageable&quot;, leads some people to believe that they
shouldn't even try to manage their own lives, because they can't.
A popular A.A. slogan declares:
<font color="#8f00bf" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;I pray to God every day that I never get the idea that I can run my own life.&quot;
</font>

<li> Failure to admit powerlessness is considered a major moral
failing, one that will doom you to relapse.


<li> Step Two is just as bad: it teaches people
that they are insane, and that only a Supernatural Being
can restore them to sanity &#8212; which means that they are helpless,
and cannot heal themselves.

<li> Then Step Three teaches a lifestyle of
passive dependency, where A.A. members turn control of their wills
and their lives over to &quot;the care of God <i>as we understood
Him</i>&quot;, and they expect God to run their lives and solve all their
problems for them from then on...

<li> And if you &quot;take your will back&quot;, that is supposedly
another major moral failing that will doom you to relapse.


<li> Steps Five and Six teach members that they have such serious moral shortcomings and
defects of character that only God can fix them.

<li> Bill Wilson constantly preached about how alcoholics must
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#logic_great" target="_blank">give up their minds,
&quot;Reason&quot;, logic</a>,
and their independent thinking and behavior, and
just <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_dependent" target="_blank">depend on A.A. to save them
and tell them what to do</a>.

<li>
Then Bill Wilson declared that depending on somebody or something else was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#baleful" target="_blank">a jolly good thing</a>.


<li> Then they construct their whole religion around the idea that we
are incapable of quitting drinking, drugging, smoking, or over-eating
without <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#God_quits" target="_blank">having
God to do the quitting for us</a>, because we are powerless
over alcohol, our addictions, nicotine, and food. (That's Alcoholics
Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Nicotine Anonymous, and Over-eaters
Anonymous), and we must have our sponsor and <i>Somebody Else</i> running
our lives for us, because we are mentally incompetent, and cannot
do it ourselves.

<li> Bill Wilson even equated
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#self_reliance" target="_blank">self-reliance</a>&quot;
with stubborn willfulness &#8212; He considered it doing
one's own will rather than the Will of God.
Bill denounced taking care of yourself and managing your own life as
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#play_God" target="_blank">playing God</a>&quot;.
As Bill saw it, only God (or your A.A. sponsor) has the right to tell
you what to do. You don't have the right to decide for yourself what
you will do with your life.

<p>
<a name="dependent"> </a>
<a name="right2think"> </a>
<li> Bill Wilson repeatedly instructed members to become
<a href="orange-not_good.html#dependency" target="_blank">dependent upon A.A.</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... By so accepting our dependence on this marvel of science
[electricity], we find ourselves more independent personally. &nbsp; ...<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But the moment our mental or emotional independence is in question,
how differently we behave.
How persistently we claim the right to decide all by ourselves
just what we shall think and just how we shall act.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We are certain that our intelligence, backed by willpower,
can rightly control our inner lives and guarantee us success in
the world we live in. This brave philosophy, wherein each man
plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to
meet this acid test: how well does it actually work? 
One good look in the mirror ought to be answer enough for any
alcoholic.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... The philosophy of self-sufficiency is not paying off. Plainly enough,
it is a bone-crushing juggernaut whose final achievement is ruin.<br>

And Bill Wilson himself went into a deep
clinical depression that lasted 11 years. He was so far gone that
all he could do was hold his head in his hands all day long,

&quot;No baleful results.&quot; Yeh, right.

In other words: &quot;<i>Chaplain Jerry</i> of Hazelden&quot; says that you should dump
your current religion, and just believe in Alcoholics Anonymous.
&quot;For a while&quot; will end up being &quot;forever&quot;.
They say that Alcoholics Anonymous isn't a competing religion,
while they backstab and undercut the other religions. (But that
comes as no great surprise, because that's what
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's
<i><b>Oxford Group</b></i> cult</a> did, too, and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believer" target="_blank">Bill Wilson learned that
stunt</a> from them. Then Hazelden learned it from Bill Wilson.)

<p>
Then, that Hazelden propaganda book <i>The Way Home</i> ended that
fictitious group therapy session with this hypocritical fluff:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Next, Jerry took a medallion from his pocket and showed it to the group.
&quot;This is my medallion,&quot; he said. &quot;It has the Roman numeral six
on it and symbolizes the number of years I've been sober. On the back
is a triangle that reads: 'To Thine Own Self Be True.' It appears in <i>Hamlet</i>.
In your relationship to your inner self, this dictum is critically important.
Be honest with yourself, with others, and with your Higher Power.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Can I see it?&quot; Ann asked. Jerry passed it to her.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;What do the letters H-O-W stand for?&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;HOW the program of Alcoholics Anonymous works: Honesty,
openness, and willingness,&quot; Jerry replied.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Cool,&quot; Ann said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Yes, it is cool,&quot; Liz added.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ann smiled.<br>

One last comment on that book: Notice how A.A. gets to eat its cake
and have it too when Hazelden publishes pro-A.A. books
&#8212; A.A. benefits from all of the ridiculous proselytizing propaganda
that Hazelden publishes, but if anyone calls them on it, and criticizes
them for things like back-stabbing the other religions, A.A.
can claim innocence and say that they don't have any control over
Hazelden, so they aren't to blame for what Hazelden says or does...
That's a cute trick, isn't it? There are definite benefits to having
front groups working for you.

<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<font color="blue">
And the truth is, A.A.W.S. &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous World Services,
Inc. &#8212; has a representative on the Hazelden Foundation Board of
Directors, so A.A. most assuredly does have some control over what
Hazelden does. And conversely, Hazelden is the single largest buyer
and reseller of the books that A.A.W.S.
publishes,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
so Hazelden has influence over A.A.W.S., too. They are very much
in bed together. In many ways, for all practical purposes, Hazelden is just another
front for Alcoholics Anonymous.

One of the most pervasive redefinitions
in the Alcoholics Anonymous dictionary is the meaning of the word
&quot;spiritual.&quot;
<i>Spiritual</i> seems to mean different
things at different times:
<ul>
<li> Sometimes it means doing the Twelve Steps.
<li> Sometimes it means going to meetings.
<li> Sometimes it means believing in God, as <b><i>&quot;we&quot;</i></b>
understand Him, or
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#deity3" target="_blank">as
A.A. understands Him</a>.
<li> Sometimes it means recruiting new members for the cult.
<li> Sometimes, it is some kind of technology, or magic:<br>
<font color="#8f00bf">
<i>&quot;Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles
would solve all my problems.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, page 42.)</font>

<li> Sometimes, it is just part of a smug game of one-upmanship:<br>
<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;Religion is for people who are afraid of going to Hell;
Spirituality is for people who have been there.&quot;<br>
</font>
(Which implies
that A.A. people are superior to ordinary religious believers,
because A.A. members aren't afraid of going to Hell any more.)


<p>
<li> And sometimes &quot;spiritual growth&quot; or
&quot;spiritual development&quot; means
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#going_insane" target="_blank">
becoming a religious fanatic</a>
and obsessively devoting your whole life to A.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Assume on the other hand that father has, at the outset,
<font color="#8f00bf">
a stirring spiritual experience.
Overnight, as it were, he is a different man.
He becomes a religious enthusiast.
He is unable to focus on anything else.
</font>
As soon as his sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course,
the family may look at their strange new dad with apprehension, then with
irritation.
<font color="#8f00bf">
There is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and night.<br>
</font>
 ... <br>
Though the family does not fully agree with dad's spiritual
activities, they should let him have his head.
<font color="#8f00bf">
Even if he
displays a certain amount of neglect and irresponsibility
towards the family,
</font>
it is well to let him go as far as he likes
in helping other alcoholics. During those first days of
convalescence, this will do more to insure his sobriety than
anything else.
<font color="#8f00bf">
Though some of his manifestations are alarming and disagreeable,
</font>
we think dad will be on a firmer foundation than the man who
is placing business or professional success ahead of
<font color="#8f00bf">
spiritual development.<br></font>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, <i>The Family Afterward</i>, pages 129-130.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, his manifestations are alarming and disagreeable &#8212; he is
neglecting his family and career while he turns into an obsessed,
monomaniacal,
<font color="#8f00bf">
&quot;<b>religious enthusiast</b>&quot;
</font>
who cannot focus on anything else.
And then they say that A.A. is &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;. Huh?
</ul>

<p>
And much of the A.A.-booster literature is even worse when it comes
to defining &quot;spirituality&quot;. See the article
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank"><i>Spirituality: The key to recovery
from alcoholism</i></a> for an entertaining example of someone constantly
flip-flopping around like a fish out of water, trying to figure out what it is.

<p><br><center><img src="/web/20161103222447im_/https://www.orange-papers.org/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

Historically, William G. Wilson started off talking about religious
experiences. That's what he felt he had on December 14, 1934.
At least, that's what he thought he had after he read William
James's book, <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> in the
following days.
But that terminology was a problem &#8212; Bill didn't want to get
into trouble with the Catholic Church, which would have then
banned the organization if they felt that A.A. was a competing
religion. Bill found a simple solution in the
word game that the Oxford Group used: Oxford Groupers called
themselves &quot;More spiritual than religious&quot;, and Bill
found it useful to extend the terminology just a little bit further,
and declare that Alcoholics Anonymous was &quot;spiritual&quot;,
and not religious at all.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The Oxford Group is not a new religion; it is religion anew.&quot;<br>

<p>
<blockquote>

<p>

<p>

<blockquote>

</font>

<p>

<blockquote>

</font>
<font size="-1">== A.A. slogan.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="interchangeable"> </a>
Still, Wilson's substitution of the word &quot;spiritual&quot;
for &quot;religious&quot; wasn't complete. When he added an
appendix to the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">rationalizing
why the Twelve Steps were failing</a>
to give members religious or spiritual experiences, he wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terms &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;
are used many times in this book which, upon careful reading,
shows that the personality change sufficient to bring about
recovery from alcoholism has manifested itself among us in many
different forms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the
impression that these personality changes, or
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>religious experiences</b></font>,
must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals.
Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Appendix II, <i>Spiritual Experience</i>, page 569.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So there it is:
you can get your religious experience very quickly or very slowly, but
you must get one. Bill says that the goal of the Alcoholics Anonymous
program is to
induce religious experiences
so strong that they will permanently change the personality of the
newcomer and make him quit drinking forever.
<p>
<center>
<table width="88%" border="3" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Unfortunately, the technology that Bill thought he had discovered
for causing such a religious experience, &quot;completely deflating the ego&quot;,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">does not work at all</a>,
and is nothing but psycho-babble nonsense.
Worse yet, Bill's nonsense is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">demonstrably harmful</a>
to many people, and has even driven people to
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Talbott" target="_blank">suicide</a>.

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
In those two paragraphs,
Wilson used both the &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and
&quot;religious experience&quot; terms. They were interchangeable,
and meant the same thing, as far as Bill was concerned.
Claiming that A.A. was 'not a religion' was just a word game
that Bill Wilson used to hide from the newcomers the fact that A.A. was a religion.
Like Wilson wrote while warning recruiters not to use religious terms which
would tip off a prospective recruit about the real nature of the Alcoholics
Anonymous program,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There is no use arousing any prejudice he may have against certain
theological terms and conceptions about which he may already be
confused. Don't raise such issues, no matter what your own
convictions are.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions,
<a href="orange-recruit.html#arousing_prejudice" target="_blank">page 93</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, Bill Wilson wrote that the ultimate effect of &quot;working
the program&quot; was religious conversion. In his second book,
Wilson described his experiences while indoctrinating and converting newcomers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
From great numbers of such
experiences, we could predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
pages 108-109.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, in spite of Bill Wilson's denials, Alcoholics Anonymous
is blatantly, obviously a religion. Bill Wilson left no doubt:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">
Our real purpose is to fit
ourselves to be of maximum service to God</font>
and the people about us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, page 77.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="3" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

But the only way that they want to &quot;serve&quot; other people
is to convert them to Bill Wilson's religious
beliefs. A.A. intends to perform no other
&quot;services&quot; for people, because:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 7, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 98.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's why you never see Alcoholics Anonymous doing any
charitable work for
the homeless people, many of whom are alcoholics.
Just <a href="orange-rroot210.html#social_problems" target="_blank">as
Frank Buchman taught</a>, the poor and the homeless should learn
to rely on God.

One last parting comment on the <i>&quot;It's spiritual, not
religious&quot;</i>
slogan: They goofed and let the truth, and that nasty 9-lettered 'R'-word,
slip into the <i>Big Book</i> in a few places:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

he said, &quot;I've got <font color="#9F0000">religion</font>.&quot;<br>

A.A. claims that it is a &quot;spiritual&quot; organization, and not
&quot;religious&quot;, and not a religion, but there is no great
difference between the words &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;spiritual.&quot;
The distinction is artificial &#8212; just another deceptive word game.
<p>
In the case of <i>Grandberg v. Ashland County</i>, a 1984 Federal 7th Circuit Court
ruling concerning judicially-mandated A.A. attendance, the court said:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous materials and the testimony of the witness established
beyond a doubt that religious activities, as defined in constitutional law,
were a part of the treatment program.
The distinction between religion and spirituality is meaningless, and
serves merely to confuse the issue.<br>
</font>
&#8212; Wisconsin's District Judge John Shabaz<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
 
All of these courts have ruled that Alcoholics Anonymous is a religion
or engages in religious activities:
<ul>
<li> the Federal 7th Circuit Court in Wisconsin, 1984.
<li> the Federal District Court for Southern New York, 1994.
<li> the New York Court of Appeals, 1996.
<li> the New York State Supreme Court, 1996.
<li> the U.S. Supreme Court, 1997.
<li> the Tennessee State Supreme Court.

<li> the Federal Appeals Court in Chicago, 1996.
<li> the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, September 7, 2007.
</ul>
<p>
The United States Supreme Court has refused to hear challenges to
those rulings, or to change or over-turn those lower court decisions.
By letting them stand, the Supreme Court has made them the law of
the land.

But there is one very important exception to that statement
 &#8212; one case has been heard by the U.S. Supreme Court &#8212;
the <i>Griffin v. Coughlin</i> decision, from the New York State Court
of Appeals, 1996, was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1997.
<p>
In <i>Griffin v. Coughlin</i>, the prison inmate David Griffin complained that
state prison officials in 1991 told David Griffin, a self-described
atheist with a history of drug abuse, that in order to be eligible for
expanded family visitation privileges, including conjugal visits, he
would have to attend a prison rehabilitation program patterned after
AA's 12-Step model.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
<p>
Griffin, then a prisoner at the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in
Ulster County, refused to attend the program, contending that the 12-Step
approach requires participants to express a belief in a &quot;power greater
than ourselves&quot; and to &quot;turn our will and our lives over to
the care of God as we understood him.&quot; These requirements, his
lawsuit against the state contended, violate the First Amendment's mandated
separation of church and state.
<p>
Griffin lost in two lower courts, but won in New York State's highest court, the
New York Court of Appeals.
<p>
In <i>Griffin v. Coughlin</i>, Judge Levine, writing for the court's
majority, concluded that the AA program is devoted to proselytizing for
a religious belief. The court's conclusion was based on its reading of
several profiles of early AA members as they are set forth in the AA
Big Book and the AA Twelve and Twelve.
<p>
Judge Levine said &quot;While it is of course true that the primary
objective of A.A. is to enable its adherents to achieve sobriety, its
doctrine unmistakably urges that the path to staying sober and to
becoming happily and usefully whole is by wholeheartedly embracing
traditional theistic beliefs.&quot;
<p> 
From its review of AA literature, the majority concluded that the AA
Twelve Steps amount to a worship service and that the AA fellowship is
dedicated to converting alcoholics to a belief in a traditional deity.
Accordingly, the court found that, &quot;The foregoing demonstrates
beyond peradventure that doctrinally and as actually practiced in the
12-Step methodology, adherence to the A.A. fellowship entails engagement
in religious activity and religious proselytization. Followers are urged
to accept the existence of God as a Supreme Being, Creator, Father of
Light and Spirit of the Universe.&quot;
<p>


<a name="ftnt03_ret"> </a>
When the U.S. Supreme Court heard the appeal, it sided with the atheist
convict who said the New York Department of Corrections' attempt to link
extra privileges for inmates with attendance at meetings modeled after
Alcoholics Anonymous violated the constitutionally mandated separation
of church and state.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>

</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>

On November 14, 1999 the U.S. Supreme Court refused to overturn,
thus allowed to stand, a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit ordering that forced attendance at Narcotics Anonymous
meetings end immediately, because it was a violation of Freedom of Religion.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and the high courts of
the states of Tennessee and New York have also made the same
ruling.

<p>
Legally, Alcoholics Anonymous is established as a religious organization. And so
is Narcotics Anonymous. Lawyers and judges now consider the issue
&quot;a moot point&quot;, one that is so thoroughly established that they will
not argue the point again. They just accept it as a given.

<p>
<a name="confessional"> </a>
Then, for a recent legal kicker, on July 31, 2001, United States
District Court Judge Charles Brieant overturned the manslaughter
conviction of Paul Cox because Cox had &quot;shared&quot; his memories
of two murders with other Alcoholics Anonymous members at an A.A. meeting,
and then one of those members turned him in. And at the trial, other
A.A. members were subpoenaed and forced to testify against Cox.
<p>
The District Court Judge ruled that Cox's confession at the A.A.
meeting was protected and inadmissible evidence, just like Catholics'
confessions to their priests are protected and inadmissible in court.
Judge Brieant cited a 1999 federal appeals court declaration that
Alcoholics Anonymous is a religion.
And then the judge threw out the conviction because it was based on
inadmissible evidence.
<p>
As far as the courts of the USA are concerned, Alcoholics Anonymous
and Narcotics Anonymous are, beyond a doubt, organizations that engage
in religious activities. And their
meetings qualify as religious services. It's a done deal. Nobody denies it but
Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and the other 12-Step groups.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="Brieant_overturned"> </a>
UPDATE:<br>
An appeals court has overturned Judge Brieant's ruling on the grounds that
Cox was not seeking religious counselling when he confessed to murder &#8212; some
of his confessing to fellow A.A. members was done immediately after the A.A. meeting,
and was not done while &quot;seeking spiritual guidance&quot;.
<p>
The general opinion is that this now opens the door of the 12-Step clubhouse
to legal intrusions, and anything you say in a 12-Step meeting <i>could be</i>,
or <i>might be</i>, used against you in a court of law.
<p>
In fact, the police in Toronto, Canada, have been found to be
sending secret agents into
Narcotics Anonymous meetings to gather information on the dopers...
<p>
We don't know for sure what they are doing in the USA...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
UPDATE 2:<br>
24 February 2003:<br>
The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the appeal of Paul Cox.
The appeals court had stopped short of deciding
whether AA conversations were protected as
religious speech, ruling only that the court record
of the case failed to establish that Cox
communicated with fellow AA members to seek
spiritual guidance. 
The Supreme Court denied the appeal Monday without comment or
hearing oral arguments in the matter, thus letting stand the decision of the
appeals court.

And most recently, the Federal Appeals Court in Hawaii, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, September 7, 2007, in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222447/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/229810/AA_Can_Not_Be_Forced_Onto_Parolees" target="_blank">the Inouye v. Kemna case</a>,
ruled that any &quot;coercing authority&quot; can be held individually,
civilly liable for the 1st Amendment constitutional rights violation that
they perpetrate on people unwillingly and involuntarily forced to go to
12-Step programs. Meaning: <b>you can sue a judge, a prison warden, a parole officer,
a &quot;counselor&quot;, or anyone else in a position of authority who
forces you to go to A.A. meetings</b>.

<p>
Also see the SMART web page about legal cases that have established that
coerced A.A. meeting attendance is unConstitutional:

One last item: try to reconcile the statement,
&quot;It's spiritual, not religious,&quot;
with this quote from the A.A. &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This was such a new thought to me that I got all sorts of
books on Higher Powers, and I put a Bible by my bedside, and I
put a Bible in my car. It is still there. And I put a Bible in
my locker at the hospital. And I put a Bible in my desk.
And I put a Big Book by my night stand, and I put a
&quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot; in my locker
at the hospital, and I got books by Emmet Fox, and I got books
by God-knows-who, and I got to reading all of these things.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, anonymous,
Chapter C6, <i>Physician, Heal Thyself!</i>, Page 348.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since when is the Bible <i>&quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;</i>?

<p><br><center><img src="/web/20161103222447im_/https://www.orange-papers.org/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

The A.A. people are always saying that their program is &quot;Spiritual,
not Religious.&quot;
<p>
Some people were asking, &quot;What's the difference between
religion and spirituality?&quot;
<p>
The answer is simple: &quot;The religious people meet in a church &#8212;
specifically, in the church main hall. The A.A. 'spiritual' people
meet in the church basement.&quot;

<h2>Footnotes:</h2>
<p>

<a name="asterisk">*</a> Four or five of the Ten Commandments mention God:
Which it is depends on the &quot;Honor thy mother and father&quot; commandment.
That wording doesn't mention God.
But the original text in the Bible, in the book of Exodus, chapter
20, does. The modern translation reads: &quot;Respect your father
and your mother, and you will live a long time in the land I am
giving you.&quot; The speaker is God, so that commandment indirectly
refers to God.

Kurtz, in <i>Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
1991, page 281, says that one large treatment
agency accounts for two thirds of the outside sales of A.A.W.S. literature.
Without a doubt, that one treatment agency is Hazelden.
They so aggressively redistribute A.A. literature that the California
Supreme Court ordered all Hazelden and A.A. literature removed from
the California schools on the grounds that Hazelden was promoting a religion.
