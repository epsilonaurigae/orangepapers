Okay, so you haven't actually read the papers that you are criticizing.
You haven't bothered to really hear the arguments or see the evidence, so you are
speaking from an uninformed biased viewpoint, jumping to conclusions before you
even learn the facts. That is exactly the behavior that Bill Wilson complained about in
the <i>Big Book</i> (when people rejected his cult religion without trying it):

 congratulate him on finding his &quot;niche&quot; on the internet and making

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
It's very simple: most years, the donations are under $200, and come in a variety of sizes,
from a variety of non-rich people.
The largest donation I ever got was $200, many years ago. 
This year started off good and then fizzled. I have only received one under-$20 donation in
months. You see, the web site does not make a profit. It is an expense.
<p>
Hosting the web site on Hostmonster.com costs $100 per year. And then there are always
a zillion little and large expenses &#8212; things breaking or burning out, blank CDs and DVDs
to buy for backups, and cables and accessories.
In just the last year, I bought $400 worth of disk drives just to back things up. And three
used monitors at Goodwill for around $15 each. And about a year ago, I got a broken laptop computer
for $35 at Goodwill, and bought a new screen for it ($90), and fixed it up, and now it's
my main computer and it's the one that I carry to the library to get on the Internet.
I don't pay the local cable company for Internet access because it's too expensive.
They want you to buy $100 per month of TV along with the Internet, and I choose to not do that.

<p>
I am an elderly disabled Veteran who is living off of a small V.A. pension.
That's how I pay the rent.
<p>
I don't make a living off of the web site. Like I said, it costs
money to do the web site. I could make some money off of advertising, but
I don't take any advertising because most requested placements of ads
are for rehabs that sell the 12-Step cult religion as a quack cure for addictions.
And, unlike some other people whom I could mention, I won't lie to sick people like that.
So I don't make any money off of advertising.

 They were well-known as vindictive and I didn't want to end up homeless.
<p>
But I moved to better housing and dropped the anonymity several years ago.
Even you got my name correct without reading much of the web site: Terrance Hodgins.
That isn't a secret, and I'm not &quot;hiding&quot;.

That's just the A.A. cult religion &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;non-cure, but a daily reprieve&quot;, again.
How many people get cured of cancer by praying? Diabetes? Heart attacks? Flesh-eating bacteria?
Does praying and begging a &quot;higher power&quot; really work on any disease?
Show me the evidence. I want to see the cure rate.
You are hinting that it works. So let's see your evidence.

<p>
Especially consider the fact that
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">A.A. claims that you can use <i>anything</i> as
your &quot;higher power&quot;, or your &quot;god&quot;</a>.
They say that you can pray
to a bedpan or a doorknob, or a parakeet, or a cat, or a mountain, or a motorcycle.
Or a Golden Calf.
Apparently, stone idols like Kon-Tiki are also okay. And the A.A.
 G.O.D. can even be &quot;a Group Of Drunks&quot;.
Can you tell me how praying to a stone idol or a group of drunks will work?
What magical powers do they have?

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
The first sentence is false, and the second sentence is half true.
A.A. does not serve a need; it poisons sick people with cult religion dogma and self-criticism
and lectures about powerlessness.
<p>

People who want to recover from alcohol addiction don't have to join a cult,
and they don't have to &quot;work a program&quot;.
You keep trying to push the idea of a &quot;recovery program&quot;
without ever showing that any &quot;program&quot; actually works.
<p>
Come on, what's the cure rate of your &quot;program&quot;?
If we send 1000 randomly-selected alcoholics to A.A., how many of them will be clean and sober
a year later?

<p>
You want a program that really works? Here is my simple one-step program that never fails, if you just
always follow my simple program:
<center>
<h2>&quot;Just don't take that first drink, not ever, no matter what.&quot;</h2>
</center>
<p>
It works every time.

There are plenty of non-cultish groups around

Actually, the AMA is very mixed up on the subject.
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">Look here for the story</a>.

<p>
Does one need a doctor? Well yes, if you want actual medical care.
Your average A.A. sponsor is not qualified to diagnose and treat cirrhosis of the liver or peripheral nerve
damage or brain damage or any other alcohol-induced condition.
Nor is the sponsor qualified or licensed to prescribe medications.

 AA, not because their Doctor suggested he/she should go.  <br>

Not all alcoholics loose everything and end up homeless. Some do, some don't, I did.

What led me to A.A. was a so-called &quot;treatment program&quot; where
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Harry_K" target="_blank">a cocaine-snorting

No, actually, you are misunderstanding the numbers. A.A. has less than a 5% <i><b>retention rate</b></i>,
not a &quot;cure rate&quot;. The A.A. cure rate, above the normal rate of spontaneous remission, is zero.
Only those people who are ready, eager, and willing to quit really do so. (We just covered that.)
A.A. does not deserve any credit for them.

<p>
Even that 5% retention rate is in doubt. One mathematician found that A.A. would be growing
rapidly, not shrinking like it really is, if it had a 5% retention rate. Look here:

Now the first part of that sentence is true. And that explains away the entire A.A. &quot;success rate&quot;.
A few people who really want to quit drinking do so, and the rest don't.
Then A.A. steals the credit for the ones who quit drinking and disavows any responsibility for the majority
who didn't quit.
<p>
To recover from alcohol abuse, it is not necessary for the alcoholic to go to a meeting  and
&quot;admit&quot; that he or she is an alcoholic.
That is just more A.A. cult dogma. The A.A. routine is, you go to a meeting and declare,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Hi, my name is Kristin, and I'm an alcoholic,&quot;</font>
 and that is somehow supposed to be a big breakthrough.
But then they pull a switcheroo on you and change the definition of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
Sometimes an alcoholic is someone who drinks too much alcohol. Then an alcoholic is someone
who is &quot;powerless over alcohol.&quot; Then an alcoholic is someone who
has difficulties quitting drinking.
 At other times, an alcoholic
is a digusting sinner who is full of character defects and moral shortcomings and resentments,
and she needs her ego reduced...

The closest thing to official numbers that we have is the report from
Dr. George E. Vaillant, who later became a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
who found that A.A. killed more people than it saved.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">During 8 years of
testing A.A., Dr. Vaillant found that A.A. did not increase sobriety in alcoholics
at all, not even a little bit, but it did raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
Dr. Vaillant tracked his first 100 A.A.-treated patients for 8 years, and at the end of the 8 years,
the score was:
5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
And Dr. Vaillant said that A.A. had not improved the sobriety rate of the alcoholics at all.
A group of untreated alcoholics got the same sobriety rate.
So all of that meeting attendance and &quot;working the Steps&quot; was for naught.

Interesting. Did you tell the truth when you answered the questions? And more to the point,

Of course you can't say. And neither can the so-called researchers who conducted the survey.

<p>
Did the questionaire allow you to say that A.A. does not work? Did they collect any evidence for that?
Or was the questionaire rigged to only ask why A.A. works?
That sounds like a typical faked &quot;study&quot; of A.A.: They decide ahead of time what results they
want, and then they slant the questions towards that result.
They even titled the questionaire &quot;Why AA works&quot;. That is not fair and balanced reporting.

<p>
The Palo Alto, California Veteran's Administration Medical Center

Agent Orange also states that AA threatens you with statements

argument can easily be disregarded as Agent Orange even admitted on his
site that his Doctor telling him to &quot;give up alcohol or DIE&quot; was what
ultimately led HIMSELF to give up drinking on his own accord (with the
&quot;threat of his Doctor telling him, no less). What is the difference
between his Doctor telling him to &quot;give up alcohol or die&quot; or AA telling
 him to follow the 12 step program, join AA, get a sponsor or end up
dead or in jail?  What is the difference? Apparently, only a threat of
DEATH works for the alcoholic at times. There is no difference between
threats, so we can throw this argument out as well.<br>

I said that it is illegal and unConstitutional to force people to attend the meetings of a religion.
I never criticized the obviously Christian recovery programs like Calix or St. Vincent de Paul or
Saddleback. The thing about them is that they tell the truth and say that they are a religious
program.
They do not try to deceive people with the slogan, &quot;It's spiritual, not religious.&quot;

It really is an open question whether Bill Wilson would have been outed today.

about the philandering:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Tom said that it took him five years after he quit drinking to change
his behavior in this area, and for five years after that, he tried
to get Bill to change, too. &quot;Besides what he was doing to
the women he was chasing and to Lois, his behavior was a huge source
of controversy in AA,&quot; Tom said. &quot;He could be very blatant
about it, and there were times when it seemed like the reaction to
a particularly flagrant episode would end up destroying everything
he had worked for. But then people would scurry around and
smooth things over, or cover it all up.&quot;<br>

Now, don't you think that we should
throw away the A.A. &quot;Big Book&quot; because it is just the lies of a narcissistic philanderer?
It is not a &quot;program&quot; for sobriety, and it isn't spiritual.
Heck, Bill Wilson even used the <i>Big Book</i> to tell us how to cheat on our wives:

they do not mind having him as their revered leader. Bill W. did the
right thing by pressing that AA is not run by any one person, that
everyone is the same and everyone has an equal say into what goes on in

Of course there are leaders, in spite of the slogan about there being
no leaders. The first leaders you will notice are the old-timers with the most
years of <i>Time</i>, who dominate the meetings with their well-practiced raps.
Then the pyramid of leaders goes from the group secretary all the way up through
the various area leaders, up to the President and General Manager of A.A. in the Interchurch
Center in New York City.
<p>
Nobody is in charge? The previous President and General Manager was Greg Muth,
who took home $250,000 per year while instructing his minions to
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">commit perjury and sue A.A. members
in Mexico and Germany for publishing their own literature</a>.
And Muth gave his lawyer friend
<a href="orange-letters229.html#Form990" target="_blank">Thomas Jasper $469,000</a>
of A.A. funds as a going-away present. (So now you know where your dollar in the basket went.)


<p>
Now the current chair of the General Service Board, elected in 2009, is the Very
Reverend Ward Ewing, Class A Trustee and just retired President, General Theological
Seminary, NYC (Episcopal).  So, finally a man of the cloth as the head.
<p>
And the General Manager of AA's General Service Office is
<a href="orange-letters325.html#Halliday" target="_blank">Phyllis Halliday</a>.

<p>
However, you are half right, but only half right,
 about no one being revered besides Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob.
Every cult has to have its infallible holy man who cannot be questioned. 
And thou shalt not criticize the Guru. And thou shalt not compete with the Guru and
try to usurp the Guru's throne.
Now, even the A.A. co-founder Clarence Snyder has
been purged from the <i>Big Book</i> because
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html" target="_blank">he dared to criticize Bill Wilson's financial
dishonesty</a>.

<p>
However, new junior gurus have risen up, and some of them, especially Clancy, are revered
by their followers as if they were new prophets:

<li> The Road to Recovery: Another Sub-sect. Allegedly homophobic and anti-medication.
<li> Vision For You: Another Sub-sect. The original sect that the above broke away from.
<li> Joys of Recovery: Again a sect within a cult...

You made the statement that if you don't like one A.A. meeting, that you can go to another.
You imply that somehow the meetings are all different. No, they aren't. They are standardized
cookie-cutter copies of each other. They all start by reading out loud
Bill Wilson's lies from pages 58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>, and then
they read Bill Wilson's &quot;Traditions&quot;. And they all push the same
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">heretical unChristian cult religion</a>.
Then the featured speaker does a stand-up comedy routine, bragging about how sinful he was
in the bad old days.
Then they give out sobriety medallions to reward people for sober time.
Then they pass the basket for donations.
Then they have &quot;sharing&quot;, where people must introduce themselves like,
&quot;Hi, my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic,&quot; and then Joe confesses how bad he was, or is.
After a bunch of that, they hold hands and say the Lord's prayer. Then they leave, and
<a href="orange-letters127.html#thinking_about_it" target="_blank">some people find the whole routine
so depressing that they go straight to the bar for a drink</a>.

<p>
Finally, A.A. isn't &quot;grand&quot;. A.A. is a fake that fails to sober up alcoholics.
What A.A. and 12-Step treatment really
do is increase the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">death rate in alcoholics</a>,
and increase the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking rate</a>,
and increase the
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">divorce rate</a>,
and increase the
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">suicide rate</a>,
and push people into depression by inducing feelings of
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">powerlessness</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_dependent" target="_blank">dependency</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_induce_guilt" target="_blank">guilt</a>,
and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">covert fear</a>.
