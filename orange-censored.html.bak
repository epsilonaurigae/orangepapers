On Monday morning, April 21, 2003, I found that both my email account
<i><b>AgeOrange@yahoo.com</b></i> (with all of my email)
and my web site at <i><b>http://WWW.Geocities.Com/ageorange/</b></i>
had disappeared. It had been up there for nearly two years, and was heavily
indexed by all of the search engines, especially Yahoo, but it suddenly
all just disappeared.

<p>
I wrote a letter to Yahoo, asking if their server had been hacked,
explaining that my web site and email account were gone.
I received the following answer.

against the account.

We encourage you to review the Yahoo! GeoCities Terms of Service at:

Thank you,

That left me feeling a little funny. They arbitrarily destroyed a project
in which I had invested two years of work,
and they didn't even think that I rated an explanation for their actions.
Rather arrogant, don't you think?

<p>
In reading the terms of service, I found:
<p>

<center>
<table width="90%" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="3">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

You agree to not use the Service to:
<p>
(a) upload, post or otherwise transmit any Content that is unlawful,
harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar,
obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially,
ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
</font></td></tr>

<p>

I can only guess that the truth was found to be &quot;defamatory&quot; or
&quot;otherwise objectionable&quot; to some people,
like the cult religions, the phony gurus, and the quack-medicine
recovery hoaxes that I criticize.
<p>
Well of course it is.
<p>
Criminals and liars don't like the truth, and often object to it very loudly.<br>
True believers in cult religions strongly object to any criticism of their
organizations or their leaders.
<p>
But is it right to erase anyone who criticizes them?
<p>
But what kind of a country will we have if no one can say anything that
someone else objects to, even if it is true?<br>
What happens to the open forum?<br>
What happens to the free marketplace of ideas?<br>
What happens to freedom of speech?
<font color="blue">
(I never censored my critics.
I printed
<a href="orange-letters.html">their letters that criticized me</a>,
in full, for all to see.)</font>
<br>
What happens to democracy?<br>
<p>
What kind of a strange, shallow, styrofoam society will we have if
nobody and nothing can ever be &quot;controversial&quot;?
<p>
A wise man once said, &quot;The only thing necessary for evil men to
rule the world is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
<p>
And he might have added, &quot;And if the media channels will not permit criticism
of the evil-doers because it is 'controversial' and might upset somebody,
then that will really give the bad guys a leg up.&quot;
<p>
Oh well, upwards and onwards. Yahoo isn't the only game in town.
<p>
And I might suggest, if you value freedom of speech,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Boycott <i>Yahoo</i> and the companies that advertise on Yahoo.&quot;</font><br>
(And of course write to those advertisers and tell them why you are boycotting them.)
<p>
And have a good day anyway.
