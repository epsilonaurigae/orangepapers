One of the problems with Alcoholics Anonymous is that it breaks up marriages and increases the divorce rate
of its members.
<p>
A.A. literature says just the opposite, that divorces in A.A. are &quot;rare&quot;, but that is a lie, pure and simple.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Permanent marriage breakups and separations, however, are unusual in A.A.<br>

The following letters tell a very different story.
<p>

<ol>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank"><i>Psychology Today</i> magazine reported
that A.A. has a 25% divorce rate in the first year</a> when one partner joins Alcoholics Anonymous. That is sky-high.

<p><li> 
<a href="orange-letters226.html#horror" target="_blank">
&quot;her sponsor forbid her from seeing me for thirty days... and at the end of the 30 days
I was told by my now ex that I could never talk to her again&quot;</a>.

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731003633/http://lucy.semisys.com/OP/orange-letters108.html#horror" target="_blank">
She said that she was so committed to AA, that she divorced her husband of 20+ years because he complained that AA was more important to her than he was. It was! I found this shocking and COMPLETELY SELFISH. </a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#divorce" target="_blank">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i> approves of divorce, in spit of denying it
in a classic example of reversal of reality.</a>.<br>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Bill_philandering" target="_blank">
In the Big Book, Bill Wilson even gave us good old boys instructions on how to cheat on our wives and get away with it.</a>

It isn't just a matter of &quot;somebody needs to change&quot;.
It is also a matter of,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;She isn't one of us. She won't go to Al-Anon and get with the program.
She is dangerous to your sobriety. Dump her and get an A.A. girlfriend.&quot;
</font>
</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters286.html#divorce" target="_blank"> 
I've switched to past tense because that's what my 30
year marriage is &#8212; past. Our divorce was finalized 09/26/10, and Al-Anon played a
big part in destroying it. I find it quite ironic that, Al-Anon, a group dedicated
to  helping relationships &amp; families, uses insidious and unethical ways to end them.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters311.html#Nancy_M" target="_blank">A second letter from Nancy</a>:
 Her Al-Anon-indoctrinated and -isolated husband wrote, before divorcing her:
&quot;I'm grateful for the freedom I have found to invest in prime relationships since
limiting my exposure to my family and friends.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters51.html#divorce" target="_blank">My husband has changed,
 since his indoctrination into AA five years ago, into a person I truly don't know.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters33.html#divorce" target="_blank">Thanks AA for helping alcoholics
have their marriages torn asunder</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters38.html#divorce" target="_blank">I have been sober and clean for 25+ yrs. I had it made or I should
say we had it made till my wife decided to get a sponsor.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors" target="_blank">Well I met a girl in the program, we started dating, having a rather good time, till my sponsor, 11 yrs in the program, invited her over to his house, while I was working and seduced her, with this 'spiritual enlightenment', saying things like I was still sick, and I shouldn't be in a relationship.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters233.html#divorce" target="_blank">
It is being strongly "suggested" that she cut all ties with me. Really? Even she
can't make sense of this one. I can, because it smacks of 12 step indoctrination.
Why would you cut someone out of your life you know you can count on?</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters295.html#horror" target="_blank">
...he's hardly at home
when I get home from work he's gone, he eats dinner at his group because they take
turns at taking dinner for eveyone, he said they told him it's ok if he doesn't eat
with his family...</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters371.html#horror" target="_blank">
...after about a week they told her I was a trigger?
Even though I don't smoke any sort of drugs and only drink socially. They
then went as far as saying sex and even seeing me was a trigger and to
leave me asap.</a>
