Subject:  	My experience with AA<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I just wanted to add my experience with AA. I started attending when I
was just 16 years old. I had a lot of personal problems and hung around
a bad crowd. I was doing drugs and drinking, I overdosed once on drugs
and was in the hospital with alcohol poisoning at a young age. I was
arrested numerous times due to my drinking, etc. You know the story.
Anyway, after a 30 day court ordered treatment program, I began going to
AA.

<p>
As soon as I began going, I was approached by numerous older men. I was
very promiscuous at a young age due in part to abuse from my childhood.
To make a long story short, I took these men up on their offers. I'm
lucky I didn't catch any sort of disease. I left home at 17 to move in
with one of them &#8212; a 50 year old man. He was a fairly popular AA guy and
I looked up to him. He had turned his life around, quit drinking and
seemed to &quot;talk the talk&quot;. I was young, naive and desperately searching
for a savior.

<p>
Shortly after I moved in with him, this man became verbally and
physically abusive to me. The police were called by a neighbor who
overheard my cries. Shortly there after, I became pregnant. At first, I
planned on keeping the baby but partly due to family pressure and
because of my own fears, I terminated the pregnancy. I've dealt with a
lot of shame and guilt over this choice, but I never regret it.

<p>
Anyway, shortly before I  turned 18, I started escorting &#8212; all the while
attending AA meetings and financially supporting myself and my 51 year
old boyfriend. It came to a point where I had enough of providing for
the both of us and I kicked him out although continued to help him
financially. Finally, at 18, I broke off all contact with this man. He
had long since stopped going to AA. I stopped for a while too, but
continued over the next few years. I was sober the entire time but
living a life of shame, denial and abuse. There wasn't one meeting I
went to where a man didn't try to hit on me afterwards. It got to the
point where I put up a very hard front, giving dirty looks to any of the
halfway house creeps who sat around the table staring at the women
there.

<p>
I met many many people who seemed to be in desperate need of therapy
and medical intervention. People who wouldn't take medication because
they thought it would ruin their sobriety. Backstabbers who would smile
at your face and then dish out the latest gossip once you left &#8212; I was
guilty of that, too. So called &quot;friends&quot; who want nothing to do with you
if you ever leave the program. I had a friend who dated a man from the
program and he nearly killed her. She had to sit next to him once at a
meeting afterwards. Nobody knew the &quot;real&quot; him because of the
manipulation and persona he created. There are so many AA personas there
that aren't real but made up to impress the others. And yes, I've also
witnessed business owners recruiting newly sober people to work for
them.

<p>
I don't really know where I'm going with this. The 51 year old man I
moved in with died a few years later. He was found unconscious in a
park; drinking again, he finally died from esophageal cancer. I was
relieved I wouldn't see him anymore, to be honest. He told many people
in AA about the abortion and attempted to further tarnish my reputation.
I found a home group and made a lot of friends, nice genuine people. By
the time I was 20, I was still going to AA and instead of falling for
people's lies and abuse, I watched it happen around me. One young girl
hung herself. She had been going to AA regularly and I remember her
calling me for a ride to a meeting but I was unable to, I had to work.
Not long after she committed suicide and I don't know what was going on
in her life although I'm sure she dealt with her share of sexual
propositions, too. Another guy hung himself a few years later. I just
wish someone in AA or in their family could have helped them. So many
times I went to AA depressed and broken and the meetings did nothing for
me, the people ignored me and didn't seem to care... it was a lot of
&quot;politics&quot; and fitting in with the long timers crowd.

<p>
I found a nice man a year or so ago and we became engaged. He has never
been to AA and is a social drinker. My sponsor didn't think I was ready
for a relationship even though I had been sober for 5 years, earning my
university degree, working, etc. She stopped phoning me, we grew apart.
I decided to have a drink one day over the holidays. Lo and behold, I
stopped at one drink. I was an irresponsible, reckless teenager
suffering from unresolved personal problems... I'm now a smart,
competent, responsible woman. I've gone to therapy to resolve my
personal issues. I find no problem with drinking occasionally and
although I realize it's not the healthiest choice of refreshment, I can
have just one and I have never been &quot;drunk&quot; since I quit drinking at 17.
AA surrounded me with some great people but at an impressionable age, I
was taken advantage of and used. I'm grateful for AA teaching me how to
live sober but I really wish I had never fallen for so many lies.

<p>
So that's my story... thanks for your website. :) Please don't publish
my name or e-mail.

Hello NoName,
<p>
Thank you for the horror story. I'm glad to hear that you have gotten your life together and
are doing well. I'm adding this story to the list of 
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">A.A. Horror Stories</a>.

<p>
Honestly, I seriously doubt that A.A. taught you how to live sober. I'm sure that some good
people encouraged you to stay sober, but you did the learning and the work and the staying sober.
And you survived what A.A. did to you.
It sounds like A.A. hurt you more than helped you.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a good life now.

Subject:  	All psychiatric evaluations since before 1935 results could not get in alcoholics sober<br>
<p>
It is plain to see that you are dead set against Alcoholics Anonymous, And
anyone who might believe that it works. So it would certainly stand reason
that Anybody with resentment too the tune of yours Should reevaluate his
entire position in life. People Usually have researched information as to
their choices I went to many a psychologist and psychiatrist and in the end
I would have pulled the trigger rather than get sober 20 years ago when I
stopped drinking. It was not Alcoholics Anonymous nor the people in it that
got me sober. Nor was it by choice no one on this planet no one in the
psychological field not even Dr carl jung can induce a spiritual experience
into another human being. most psychologists will blindly follow the Ravings
of a madman called Sigmund Freud it would also seem that drug addict cannot
fix a normal human being simply by giving them more drugs and yes I do
understand that some people have a chemical imbalance not all people
psychiatrist in self is one that is exempt to any mental issues according to
you and your kind. at no time in my life have I never seen a psychologist
work in anybody's life. but I have seen people that psychologists destroyed
I also know how many that committed suicide after visiting the psychologist
many people because there only interest is money

Hello again, Randy,
<p>
Your subject line doesn't make much sense. If you are trying to say that psychiatrists could not
sober up alcoholics before 1935, that is wrong. That is just A.A. propaganda, just some more of
Bill's Bull, where Bill Wilson falsely claimed that A.A. was better at sobering
up alcoholics than the organizations that came before it. Wrong.
<p>
Bill Wilson also declared that A.A. was better at sobering up alcoholics than
&quot;doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists&quot;. That is also wrong,
just an outright lie.
<p>
Bill and A.A. experienced massive failure to sober up alcoholics, and Bill lied and said that
A.A. worked great.
Bill even claimed that A.A. was &quot;the miracle of the century&quot;, and
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#greatest_of_all_time" target="_blank">probably one of the greatest medical
and spiritual developments of all time</a>.&quot;
<p>
But occasionally, when it suited him, he told the opposite story and
revealed the truth, like when he was bragging at Dr. Bob's memorial service
about how hard he and Dr. Bob had to work to establish A.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>

Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;
file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The truth is that the recovery rate from alcohol abuse has been relatively steady
for a couple of centuries. A.A. has made no improvement whatsover.  Perhaps you have heard of
the Washingtonian Society, whom President Lincoln praised for their good work in sobering up
alcoholics? And there were plenty more: The Keeley League, The Women's Christian Temperance
Union, Keswick, The Emanuel Society, The Salvation Army, and more. You can read about them here:<br>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#End_of_Affluence" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-funny_spirituality.html#End_of_Affluence</a>
<p>
You started off the body of your letter with the logical fallacy of assuming
that I am wrong because I am against Alcoholics Anonymous. That is standard cult fare,
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">You are automatically wrong
because you disagree with the Guru and his teachings</a>.&quot;

<p>
The rest of your jabber about psychiatrists doesn't make much sense.<br>
You imagine that all followers of Sigmund Freud are crazy?<br>
Psychiatrists never help anybody?<br>
People just commit suicide after seeing a psychiatrist?<br>
Psychiatrists are only in it for the money?<br>
<p>
Those sure are some

And all untrue.

What is your success rate how many people at the end of their lives left
your name on there tombstone. why was the book Alcoholics Anonymous said to
be one of the 80 books changed human history the bending twisting of thought
it's not for an alchemist many of the people in your peoples profession
think they can bend and twist thoughts in order to repair a simple lie when
the lie most people tell themselves long before they get to a psychiatrist.
if in fact people come to you wanted to get better then why would they need
your help so either or you're saying that a person that wants to stop
drinking can without AA and a person that wants to think properly can do so
without the help of a psychiatrist

Randy, I do not charge people money. And I do not ask that people put my name
on their tombstone. I don't even ask that they die.

<p>
The fact that the A.A. <i>Big Book</i> has influenced the failing &quot;recovery industry&quot; is not
a good thing.  It's just like how
<a href="orange-letters43.html#TIME" target="_blank">TIME magazine grouped Bill Wilson
in with Adolf Hitler as two of the 100 most influential men of the 20th century</a>.
Yes, they were influential. But not for the good.
<p>
You are rambling. What &quot;lie they tell themselves before they get to the
psychiatrist&quot; are you talking about?

<p>
This is illogical:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;if in fact people come to you wanted to get better then why would they need
your help so either or you're saying that a person that wants to stop
drinking can without AA and a person that wants to think properly can do so
without the help of a psychiatrist&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am not running a rehab center, so no, people do not come to me for a treatment program, &quot;to get better.&quot;
I am just telling the truth about a big mess.

<p>
Yes, people can and do quit drinking without A.A. The vast majority of success stories do it without A.A.
<p>
Whether someone needs to see a psychiatrist depends on the individual person. You can't generalize
something like that.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Why spend so much time slamming A.A. imagine you really would have
something to whine about if 2 million of us collectively returned to
drinking, ....driving, doing crime, taking up state and federal resources
because we could not take care of normal things. Try reading all the
text...with an open mind. The reality is that the world is a better place
because of us. What do you bring to the table? Are you just taking up
space...always looking for differences...a waste of skin? I used to be. So,
what see you gonna do?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Craig,
<p>
I did read the <i>Big Book</i> with an open mind, and I also went to A.A. and
N.A. meetings with an open mind, really looking for something that would help
me to quit drinking and stay sober, and I learned that A.A. was a load
of bullshit, just another harmful cult religion.  There is a huge difference between
having an open mind and being gullible.
<p>
No way will 2 million of you collectively return to drinking, because there are not
2 million sober A.A. members in the whole world. The majority of A.A. members are
already drinking  &#8212;  actually, never quit  &#8212;  and they will drop out of A.A. soon,
and they will be replaced with more coerced people from the courts and treatment centers
who will also never quit drinking and soon drop out.

<p>
And no, the world is not a better place because of A.A.
Read the list of <a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">A.A. Horror Stories</a>
to see what A.A. is really doing to people.

<p>
I do offer better alternatives to A.A. Read this:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>
<p>
Lastly, the slogan about not looking for the differences is just
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think" target="_blank">another standard cult characteristic
 &#8212;  &quot;Stop Thinking&quot;  &#8212;  don't see the contradictions</a>.
No thanks, I'll keep my thinking mind anyway.

It is a narrative that I wrote for an attorney interview, so he could better

represented herself as an LADC but the NH licensing agency tells me, that although
she has a partial application in, she is not, nor has she ever been licensed in NH.
She used her power to intimidate, abuse and ultimately hold me against my will in
that 12 step holy house of horrors. I am counting down the days until I can depose
that bitch. She has no idea the shit storm that is headed her way.

Hello again, Jeff,
<p>
Yes, got the story this time. Thank you. That is quite a tale, and it sounds like
you have a very good case. An unlicensed &quot;LADC&quot; foisting her favorite religion on
people and further imprisoning them when they won't convert to her beliefs? Outrageous.
And snitching you out to your parole officer for not sharing her religious beliefs
is also defamation of character and slander, as well as false imprisonment.

<p>
Also, it seems like your parole officer is guilty of incompetence as well as false imprisonment
and coercing you into a cult religion. He sentenced you to more imprisonment without
even checking the credentials of the so-called &quot;LADC&quot; who was demanding that you be
imprisoned longer, so that you would &quot;get&quot; her religion.
 Since when is it okay to sentence someone to more imprisonment
on the say-so of a stranger who has no credentials and who is guilty of misrepresenting
her qualifications?
<p>
The case of Inouye v. Kemna established that the INDIVIDUAL officials who coerce religion
can be sued, not just their department. That means that the individual civil servants have
to pay for their own lawyers, and pay the damages themselves. It's a very different thing
from the state department being sued, and a state-paid lawyer handling the defense, and the
state's insurance company paying the damages. The individual coercing
bureaucrat is on the hook for everything.

<br> 
For more details, look

<a href="orange-letters162.html#Inouye" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
And here:
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#Inouye" target="_blank">the Inouye v. Kemna case</a>.<br>
And here:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221715/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/229810/AA_Can_Not_Be_Forced_Onto_Parolees" target="_blank">the Inouye v. Kemna case</a>.<br>
And here:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221715/http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6773570865128492755&amp;q=504+F.3d+705&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,6" target="_blank">

<p>
Now that case occurred in a different Federal Circuit Court of Appeals,
but it established a precedent.

<p>
Yes, please keep me informed about how this case is progressing. You know, this is
all it takes to destroy the 12-Step empire. If enough people sue and win, the treatment
centers will drop the coerced 12-Step religion faster than a hot potato.
After all, they are only in it for the money.
<p>
Courts and parole officers will also drop their demands that people attend A.A. meetings
when they find out how much it can cost them.
<p>
Then A.A. will shrivel up to nothing because coercive recruiting is the only thing that
is keeping it going.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Wow<br>

<p>
What a waste of energy. Your blasting of AA is not unique I have seen many
take irrational and hateful stands and paint a picture that wasn't based on
facts but appeared more to be a large emotionally charged rant.

<p>
I could point by point destroy your entire stance. But I won't waste my
time. You seem to be convinced your are absolutely correct and there is no
chance that there is any openness to another point of view.

<p>
I have never in 20 years had ANYONE try to convince me to join a religious
body or tell me what &quot;God&quot; is. AA really has no desire to have anyone
become a member that doesn't want to be. It is NOT promoted. Bill Wilson
made clear he didn't have all the answers and that AA was not for everyone.
He states &quot;We only know a little&quot; The whole of AA is an offer not a demand.

<p>
As to accusation that it is a &quot;haven&quot; for freaks AA is not perfect, there
are a few (a very few) loose cannons that do not follow through with the
steps. There are humans in AA as anywhere else. Look around you'll find
them everywhere. Sick behaviors are not unique to AA.

<p>
I used to attend meetings with a certain antipathy, I enjoyed the company
and discussions but did not care for the use of the word God. I was finally
beaten up enough to lay my guns down and quit fighting the God word as
alcohol beat me down badly once again. No one told me I had to believe in a
certain way. I know letting go of old concepts of how the world ought to be
and how others ought to treat me and following the directions in AA saved
my life. I am not Christian nor do I practice any organized religion.
HOWEVER something shifted in me that I cannot account for. God? Physic
change? who knows but I know for a fact it wasn't I that did it on my
intellect

Hello Keith,
<p>
Well, you started off with the standard A.A.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i> attack</a>
&#8212;  attack the messenger, rather than the message.
You offer no facts to support your attack, rather you claim that you can't be bothered
with refuting my information.


<p>
If you really can refute my statements point by point, please do. Let's get the truth
out on the table for all to see. Find something that I said that you don't like,
and prove it false. Of course, your supporting evidence and
information must be better than mine.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Your claim that no one tried to convert you to their religion does not invalidate
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">all of the horror stories that I have received</a>
where sponsors did just that to their sponsees.

Baloney. See the official A.A. document about &quot;cooperating&quot; with the courts in getting
more people sentenced to A.A.:<br>

Almost two-thirds of the new A.A. members are forced, sentenced, pressured,
cajoled, or blackmailed into attending A.A. meetings.

He states &quot;We only know a little&quot; The whole of AA is an offer not a demand.<br>

<p>
Also untrue.
Bill Wilson talked out of both sides of his mouth on many issues, including that one.
He also declared that A.A. was the only way, and that A.A. knew more than doctors or
psychiatrists or ministers or priests. Then it turned into &quot;Work the Steps or Die!&quot;
<p>
First, in order to sound reasonable to prospects, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
<font color="blue" face="Times" size="-1"><i>As Bill Sees It</i>,
quotes from William G. Wilson, published by A.A.W.S., page 285.</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
But then Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Any willing newcomer feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the

<p>

For most cases, there is virtually no other solution.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 43.</font>
<p> 
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual
experience will conquer. &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>

basis of life &#8212; or else.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 44.</font>
</blockquote> 
<p>
&quot;Or else&quot;, indeed.

<p>
And Bill Wilson put this self-congratulatory lunatic babbling in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote> 
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Here was a book that said that I could do something that all
these doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd
been going to for years couldn't do!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.</font><br>
</blockquote> 
<p>


 Finally, Bill Wilson wrote that you
must do all of Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps all of the time,
<font color="#9F0000"><b>or else</b></font> you are
&quot;signing your own death warrant&quot;.
<p>
<a name="death_warrant3">
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant.
His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is much more of that listed under this bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="_blank">First, Bill Wilson declared that Alcoholics
Anonymous was only one of many ways to achieve sobriety, then he declared
that it was <i>The Only Way</i>.</a>

<p><li>
About A.A. being &quot;a haven for freaks&quot;, actually, I never said that. You did.
What I said was that there are a lot of mentally-ill people who should be seeing
a psychiatrist, and there are a lot of criminals whom the judge or parole officer
sentenced to A.A. meetings.
And there are sexual predators who like the supply of fresh meat that A.A. meetings
provide.
And there are narcissistic people who like lording it over the new sponsees.
And there are the con artists who find cloudy-headed newly-detoxed people to be easy
victims.

<p><li>
Then you repeated the standard A.A. slogan about
<font color="_blank">
&quot;letting go of old concepts of how the world ought to be...&quot;</font>
What old concepts? Like the concepts that people should not lie or steal or rape
or kill or exploit others? Those old concepts? Are you getting rid of them?

<p>
So what old concepts are you getting rid of?
Please be very specific.

<p><li>
Lastly, &quot;what shifted in you&quot; was your mind.
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">The A.A. brainwashing</a>
took effect after a while, and you started repeating
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#slogan_list" target="_blank">the A.A. slogans</a>
in an unthinking manner.
</ol>


<p>
Now if you really believe that A.A. works, please tell us what the A.A. success rate really is.
You say you have 20 years in A.A., so you should certainly know the answers to these
questions:

<p>

No qualifiers are allowed, like, &quot;We will only count the people who

to cure the infection, the doctor doesn't get to say, <i>&quot;But he didn't work
the program right. He didn't pray enough.  He didn't surrender. He held something
back in his Fifth Step.&quot;</i> No excuses.

So what's the actual A.A. cure rate?

As I. All I am doing is blowing out of proportion the statements other
people make. And of course much of it sounds irrational. in regards to the
psychological field they do much good work even though it stems from a
philosophical Group in France much like the Washingtonians back in 1867, so
there for the psychological field is relatively new in itself, and in itself
it cannot claim perfection, neither can AA I personally do not recruit
anybody I am not your idea of standard AA. When I do talk to them I asked
them if they go to a psychologist or psychiatrist if in fact they are on
medication I tell them absolutely nothing about it For it is not my field
Nor is it my privilege I am NOT a doctor nor do I intend to become one I
will not become a drug &amp; alcohol counselor because I'm not qualified for it
just because I used drugs and drank a lot. I am not married nor am i a
sexual predator on the new comer. I personally don't believe in that. I do
not force my beliefs down anybody's throat nor do I sway them in any of
theirs it is not my perogative, I also know that alcohol in itself is not
addictive if it were the entire world would be addicted to it since it has
been around for 10 thousand years give or take. it really doesn't matter to
me about anybody else's money and yes I did babel quite a bit about a
variety of things. nobody on this world is perfect in any way shape or form
and if perfection of any kind did walk the face of this world. the remainder
of the human race would certainly destroy it, we've come a long way in a
couple hundred thousand years and just think no matter how we twist in bend
our Minds with whatever drugs, drink oxygen as we know it is the greatest
mind altering drug there is. In the absolute and none of it really going to
matter anyway so enjoy destroy it all who cares

Hello again, Randaron,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you don't practice sexual exploitation of newcomers
and that you don't try to act as a doctor. Thank you.

<p>
Actually, alcohol is very addictive, but you have to drink a lot of it to
get addicted. That's why most people are not addicted to alcohol
in spite of drinking alcohol during every football game.
But once addicted, quitting alcohol cold turkey can be fatal.
Hard-core, badly-addicted alcoholics who stop drinking alcohol suddenly
can go into shock, they can go into convulsions, their hearts can stop, and they can die.
<p>
A fellow who worked in a detox center told me that they put the junkies and cocaine
addicts through cold turkey withdrawal and get them off of the stuff fast, but that
you cannot do that with alcoholics. They can die from that.
&quot;They will go into shock, their hearts will stop, and they will die on you.
You actually have to give them alcohol in the hospital and wean them off of it
slowly. Sometimes it takes months.&quot;

Well I care. I know that Buddhists and Hindus say that on the highest level of
reality there is only the pure Void, crystaline undisturbed Consciousness, so
nothing can really be destroyed,
and there is nothing to get uptight about, but down here on this level we are supposed
to work to make things better.

orange,
<p>
again, just more negative, diluted, self-serving b.s. what really
amazes me is how angry and cynical those are (like yourself) that come to
A.A. looking for help, do not truly try to change, and poke holes in
everything suggested.  How you can spin even the simplest philosophy like,
&quot;look for similarities and not the differences&quot; and turn it into an ugly
thing. Stop thinking? really? if you spent the energy you do on positive
helpful things instead of trying desperately to deface a movement that
helps people, you might actually be of some importance. I bet you find the
bad in everything and call it thinking and insightful. Just because you had
a bad experience doesn't mean every single person in AA is bad and that the
entire entity is a cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Craig,
<p>
The fact remains that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. does not work</a>.
It
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">harms more people</a>
than it helps.
<p>
 And my message is not negative.
I say that people can save themselves and improve their own lives and be happy by
using their own intelligence and will power.
<p>
The slogan &quot;look for similarities and not the differences&quot;
is still an appeal to stop thinking critically and not see that the A.A. dogma
has huge problems, and it is illogical and fatally flawed.

</font>
<p>
you are fucking unbelievable, i just read that ridiculous and dangerous
&quot;program you outline for a sober life/recovery. You remind me of that
douche bag that wrote a million little pieces. you shamelessly just take
what AA has already outlined as a part of the recovery process and make it
your own, while in the previous breath you slam bill wilson for being a
liar and plagiarizing others....geez dude.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What are you talking about? &quot;What A.A. has already outlined&quot;? Please be specific.
<p>
And no, there is little similarity between what I advise, and what A.A. teaches.
About the only similarity is that we all advise people not to drink alcohol.

<p>
<ol>
<li> I don't teach people that they are powerless over alcohol. I tell people that they are powerful and can get a grip and take charge of their lives.
<li> I don't tell people that they are insane, but Bill Wilson's &quot;Higher Power&quot; will
restore them to sanity.
<li> I don't tell people that their will power is worthless. I tell people to build up
their will power.
<li> I don't tell people to stop thinking and just believe. I tell people to think
very carefully, and critically, and don't believe anything that Bill Wilson wrote.
<li> I don't tell people that they have to waste their time and mess up their minds
by listing and confessing all of their sins, &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
wrongs, and &quot;defects of character&quot;.
<li> I don't teach people that sin is the cause of all of their problems and that
confession is the cure for sin.

<li> I don't tell people that they must find God or else.
<li> I don't tell people that they must beg God to &quot;remove their defects&quot;.
I tell people to fix themselves, and to get a doctor's help if they need it.
<li> I don't tell people to conduct a s&eacute;ance and channel God or some spirits
and get secret messages and work orders and the power to carry them out.
<li> I don't tell people that Bill Wilson was carrying a message from God.
<li> I don't tell people that they must go to meetings all of the time.
<li> I don't tell people that they should get a sponsor.
<li> I don't tell people that they must get rid of ego.
<li> I don't tell people that they must go recruiting if they wish to stay sober.
<li> I don't tell people that they cannot ever leave my organization or else
they will die drunk in a gutter.
<li> I don't tell people that they cannot ever graduate from &quot;the program&quot;.
<li> I don't tell people that they cannot ever recover and be normal.

<li> I don't teach an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties.
<li> I don't teach irrational illogical magical thinking, like that ghosts or spirits
or gods will grant your wishes if you pray and beg hard enough.

<li> I don't yammer
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#slogan_list" target="_blank">900 slogans</a> at newcomers.
<li> I don't tell people that the 12 Steps are &quot;principles&quot; for recovery that
Bill Wilson got from God. I tell people that the 12 Steps are
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
 Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion recruiting and conversion practices that Bill Wilson copied from
the Oxford Group</a>.


<li> A.A. has not &quot;outlined a recovery process&quot;.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Practicing Bill Wilson's
chosen cult religion does not work as a cure for alcohol abuse</a>.
<li> I am not &quot;plagiarizing&quot; the lunatic scribblings of Bill Wilson.
Why would I want to copy the ravings of a seriously mentally-ill man?

</ol>
<p>
</font>
<p>
Well, I obviously am no pillar of stability as I am considering fronting
you off for what you really are....a sad, lonely, lost, pathetic and angry
little man that didnt have the balls to man up when YOU failed...you dump
it in AA's lap, then go on to outline how rad you are. I wish you get
everything you want in this life bro, sincerely. But dont drag people into
your cynical and hypocritical bullshit. It isn't cute, impressive, or
attractive. Bitching and whining about AA, trying to come across as way
more intellegent and insightful than you really are just isnt working. You
are so obvious and predictable. I

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have not failed. I now have 12 years off of alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and
without any A.A. theology or the 12 Steps or A.A. meetings or believing in
Bill Wilson's tyrannical &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Typical of a dry drunk.

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Dry drunk&quot;? Now
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">that accusation</a>
is typical of a well-indoctrinated A.A. cult member. Any sober person
who criticizes A.A. is supposedly a &quot;dry drunk&quot;.
Don't bother yourself with discussing the real facts, like what is the actual
A.A. cure rate, just attack critics with slurs like &quot;dry drunk&quot;.

</font>
<p>
I hope you make it back here. you obviously have some pretty cool energy
levels that could really help people. If you &quot;program works so
well....spend more time talking about it, less time talking shit on
others....

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I'm not going back to A.A. I wouldn't go back there,
even if I were to start drinking again,
which I don't think I will do. Been there, done that. I'm doing other things
with my life now.
</font>
<p>
cya, wouldnt wanna be ya.....

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh really? You wouldn't want to have 12 years of sobriety and enjoy playing
in the sunshine and feeding the cute little fluff-ball goslings?
Does that sound like Hell to you? How many years of sobriety do you have, anyway?
<p>
Now I know that pulling rank like that is a low, vile A.A. trick, but I'm going
to throw it back at you and ask, honestly, how many years of sobriety do you
have and how well is your program working? And where is that &quot;serenity&quot; that
A.A. members love to talk about?
And why don't you do something about that resentment?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.
