Nice work.  First maybe we should agree to disagree.  I read some  letters
that was sent to you,  and I will keep my serenity.   Yes,  I have done some
research on AA myself.  I must admit not  to the fullest content as you!  Please
first send me some true  evidence for the discussion of the two AA front group
writing the definition of  alcoholism for the AMA.  In plain English.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Natalie,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer. I'm really backlogged on answering email.
<p>
The discussion of the two A.A. front groups writing the goofy definition of alcoholism
for the A.M.A. is
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA">here</a>.
It's in plain English.
</font>
<p>
Explain the genetics of  alcoholism.  I personally think that you're either born
with the gene, or  with continued use body and mind will become addicted.  Have
you ever read  the AA Big Book?  Before Bill's story there is the doctor's
opinion,,,which  holds the truth for today!
<p>
<font color="blue">
I have read the <i>Big Book</i> a lot, and have even typed a lot of it.
<p>
The genetics of alcoholism are funny. I am also convinced that there is a genetic component,
and I've got it. So did my father, and his mother...
<p>
The genetics of alcoholism are different from what geneticists usually mean when they say
that something is genetically determined. If you inherit the genes for blue eyes and blond hair,
you get blue eyes and blond hair, no matter what you eat or drink or how much you pray, or
how you choose to act.
There is no gene that just makes somebody into an alcoholic like that, with no choice in the
matter.
<p>
There do, however, seem to be some genes that make you <i>more likely</i> to become an alcoholic.
I really like the way that the doctors said it in one study:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;This is only the second specific genetic mechanism ever identified
 that modulates risk for alcohol dependence.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<b>A Functional Neuropeptide Y <i>Leu7Pro</i> Polymorphism Associated

Jaakko Lappalainen, MD, PhD; Henry R. Kranzler, MD; Robert Malison, MD;
 Lawrence H. Price, MD; Christopher Van Dyck, MD; Robert A. Rosenheck, MD;

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Modulates the risk</i>, not causes. You have a choice in the matter, which blue-eyed blonds do not,
but the genetic factor is loading the dice against you.

<p>
Unfortunately, the Doctor's Opinion, by Dr. William D. Silkworth, is pretty worthless.
Dr. Silkworth was just endorsing quackery and Oxford Group nonsense.
Dr. Silkworth allowed Bill Wilson to use him to promote a cult religion.
Remember that Dr. Silkworth is the guy who gave Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">the poisonous Belladonna Cure</a>,
which was what Charlie Towns' Hospital was selling at the time &#8212; just more quackery &#8212;
which caused Bill Wilson to &quot;see God&quot;.
</font>
<p>
The statistics that kept me sick was the one's you've been showing.   For so
long I looked at AA as a cult.  The people were pathetic, whining  over their
lives.  Having a sponsor to advise you through the 12 steps, I  thought was
weak.  Always looking at your part to play in every situation,  weak.  And that
my friend, kept me sick.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. What kept you sick was drinking alcohol. Statistics don't make people drink alcohol.
People drink alcohol for a variety of reasons, like that they are sick and in pain, or that they
strongly desire to feel good and get high, or because they want to drink away some mental anguish...
There are a lot of reasons for drinking to excess, but hearing some statistics isn't one of them.
<p>
Likewise, thinking that A.A. is a cult does not keep people sick.
<p>
Now what was the <i>REAL REASON</i> that you drank too much alcohol?
</font>
<p>
  This &quot;disease&quot;/alcoholism  cannot be understood by
anyone that is not one themselves.  We will  definitely disagree if you are not
an alcoholic/addict and say you do understand  what it's like to be a
prisoner of a mental illness.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is again a bunch of bull. That is the typical cult attitude that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special"><i>Only Another Member Really Understands</i></a>.
They have been teaching you garbage.
<p>
I most assuredly am an alcoholic, and have been through the mill too,
and to Hell and back, so you can dump the rap about how I won't understand.
Please read <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>.

</font>
<p>
  And that reminds me  of something else,  Bill W.
probably did have delusions of grandure  because if he was anything like me I am
also Bipolar!
<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay. Sounds true.
</font>
<p>
I do not want anyone to die from this (to not be selfish I will call this  an
illness and not a disease)!  You must know that in order to recover, you
must surrender.
<p>
<font color="blue">
NO! That is not true at all. That is the cult talking, saying that you must surrender to them.
Now they cleverly change the wording, and say that you are surrendering to God or something,
but then they will be the ones who tell you what God wants...
<p>
I recovered from alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction without surrendering to anything.
</font>
<p>

  I have a brother who is an active alcoholic who has hit  many
bottoms and do not take this out of context-he only has one ultimate bottom
left,,,DEATH.  Do you think I wish that on my only sibling?  I pray  every single
day for him.  I cannot change him.  I have tried and  tried and tried.  He
would rather sit in jail right now than go to  treatment.  Orange, that is
heartbreaking to me.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it is heart-breaking to me too. The sad truth is that approximately half of the alcoholics
choose to die rather than quit drinking.
</font>
<p>

  I have experienced  healthy sobriety for once in my life, I
have finally found the solution for my  alcoholism,,,but my brother has to want
it, at this time he doesn't want it, and  I have to accept that.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you can keep trying to get him to quit harming his health, but you have to accept the
fact that you cannot make his choices for him.
<p>
 And do not rule out suggesting something else
to him. Perhaps he just hates Alcoholics Anonymous because he doesn't like the cultish nature
of it. How about suggesting SMART or one of the non-cult self-help groups? I have
<a href="orange-letters65.html#alt_list">a list of them here</a>.
</font>
<p>
There are different degrees of AAs.  Some feel they must go to a  meeting
every day.  They only hang out socially with AAs.  Personally,  that is still
life unbalanced!  I have God, and it's not AA.  I found  him, again, through AA.
I make 3-4 meetings a week, actually have a  sponsor and working 12 steps.  I
also sponsor.  I also have a life  outside of AA.  Friends outside of AA, and
do things socially outside of  AA!  THAT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IF AA WAS A
CULT, DON'T YA  THINK?      I'm curious to hear back from you.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is nonsense. There are degrees of possessiveness in various cults.
Many do allow lots of outside contact.
And then, some discourage it.
 We have just been discussing the
Washington DC &quot;Midtown Group&quot;,
an obnoxious and criminal Young People's A.A. group,
 which does in fact restrict people to just associating with the group
and only attending their meetings (one every day).
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group">Look here</a>.
<p>
The fact that they will let you out of your cage once in a while doesn't mean that you are free.

Subject:  	huh?<br>

<p>
Somebody has too much time on his hands.
<p>
Some of your points are well taken. Yes, Bill W. was no saint. We who have been
around AA a while know he was a womanizer, we know he did LSD, we know he was
depressed. Big fuckin' deal. All of the history and gray underbelly doesn't
belong in a primer on recovery. Yes it is a little over simplified, yes it leans
towards stereotypes, but the fact is, it works pretty well. I am an athiest
intellectual and a skeptic, and despite having discovered the clay feet of the
founders, I've gone twenty years without a drink. I can skip over some of the
religious points and keep the best parts- the analysis and catharsis of the
steps, the shame-defeating 9th step, the confidence builder of working with the
newcomers.
<p>
Yo:  Chill out a little. Nothing in any of the books is evil. Antiquated, maybe.
A little precious sometimes, surely. But I swear to Dog, it works.
<p>
(You are right that AA wants to cause a failure of ego, because recovery demends
a surrender. But our self esteem builds up immediately with the successful
recovery.)
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Dave,
<p>
I assume that &quot;chill out&quot; must mean &quot;please quit telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;
<p>
You say,
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Yes it is a little over simplified, yes it leans

</font>
<p>
I guess you must be claiming that Alcoholics Anonymous works to make alcoholics quit drinking
alcohol.<br>
No, it doesn't. A.A. is a total failure. We've been over this a hundred times before.
(Look
<a href="orange-letters83.html#AA_works1">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters83.html#AA_works2">here</a>.)
A.A. members just keep chanting,
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;Keep Coming Back! It Works!&quot;</font>
 while ignoring the
obvious facts of the matter, like the humongous A.A. dropout rate, and the death rate, and the suicide
rate, and the cultish nature of Alcoholics Anonymous...
<p>
Lying to sick people about what will cure them and how well the cure works is most assuredly evil.
<p>
Have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Your webpage...<br>

<p>
I started reading it but I haven't finished. I just felt that maybe you are
one that is able to look back and see the present. I am a sponsor in AA who
doesn't teach the traditional way of half measures. I go all the way. I've
learned that just like the prophets in the bible and of every religion
didn't know what they were seeing and writing down, so it is also with AA.
I'd like to discuss AA coming of age in the present tense and where God
taking this ship, this fellowship.

<p>
Are you familiar with the seven deadly sins in the Big Book? They match the
seven deadly sins that Jesus spoke of. Believe me, I see Christians, Jews,
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, virtually all religions and sects doing
the same thing you talk about in AA. Body addiction. Flesh worship. For
example, Christians worshiping Jesus which is only the flesh rather than the
word, which is God. They are totally into stroking their bodies which is
only a tabernacle, a tent, a temporary dwelling place.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Stephen,
<p>
I did not notice the Seven Deadly Sins in the &quot;Big Book&quot;, but did know about
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness">Bill Wilson's rap about them</a>
 in his second book, &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;.

</font>
<p>
One other example is sex and marriage. Marriage is for those who can't
contain themselves... It's right there in the bible in very plain English.
Sex is no different than smoking in the spiritual realm. It's a destructive
distraction that puts the focus on the senses and takes the focus off God.
Remember, adultery and fornication are not good things but they're accepted
as good now like smoking wasn't seen as being that bad back in Bill Wilson's
day.

<p>
Judges used to smoke sitting at the bench during court back then. It's
gotten much worse since then, trust me, I see what you see in hindsight,
only it's in the present right now. Let's talk murder for example. Doctor's
have a pre set fee schedule and the majority of them turn away patients
every day. Those patients treatment is postponed or never comes. The doctors
know that the patients condition is life threatening; they will die without
treatment. That's pre meditated murder.

<p>
Ok, now what about food, water, shelter. When man assumes the role of land
lord and withholds the basic necessities of life and someone dies as a
result. That's pre meditated murder. Shall I continue.

<p>
So, in the world of justifications Coffee and tobacco are no problem. Every
tax paying American has killed and has blood on their hands. I know this
because they payed me to kill people to protect their way of life, not
because their lives were being threatened.

<p>
I will go further with you if you like. Please feel free to write back or
not. In fact I don't expect to hear from you at all. I've evolved, I can
only hope for humanity to do the same.

<p>
Patience, tolerance, love &amp; understanding,<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Stephen,

Subject:  	Comments and a Question<br>

<p>
Dear A. Orange,

<p>
I have to admit I find your articles to be very interesting regarding the
psychological state of Bill Wilson.  You paint a picture of a power-crazed
egomaniac.  From what little I've read on my own, I can't dispute anything
that I've read in your articles.  You provide example after example to
support your case.  You obviously feel very passionate about the subject,
and I can admire that.

<p>
I also thoroughly enjoyed reading your analysis of propaganda and debating
techniques.   I've never really thought about how brain-washing is
accomplished, but you've sparked some interest in me, so thank you for that.

<p>
That said, what motivated you to put so much time into tearing apart Bill
W's personal life, his pathology, and general lack of humility?

<p>
To put the question another way:  So what if AA's &quot;Buddha&quot; is a crazy
alcoholic?  His message seems to be working for millions of people.  Why do
you feel compelled to tear it apart?

<p>
(If  you've already addressed this in one of your other articles that I
haven't stumbled upon yet, please send me the link)

<p>
I really found reading your articles very enlightening and entertaining,
especially since I'm relatively new to recovery myself.  If Bill was an
Asshole, so be it.  But I get the feeling that something really crawled up
you're ass about this whole thing and I'm curious what it was!!'

<p>
I hope to hear back from you.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Mike

<p>

Hello Mike,

Sorry to take so long to answer. I've been way backlogged in answering email.
Thanks for all of the compliments.

You hit on the key point right here:

</blockquote>

<p>
The truth is that Bill Wilson's &quot;message&quot; is not working for millions. That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">The Big Lie</a>
of Alcoholics Anonymous. A.A. does not work any better than no treatment at all, and has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a higher binge drinking rate</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">a higher death rate</a>.
<p>
We were just talking about the A.A. failure rate
<a href="orange-letters83.html#AA_works1">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters83.html#AA_works2">here</a>.
<p>
The statement that A.A. has worked for millions is the biggest fairy tale that A.A. has promulgated.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">Bill Wilson started lying
 about the A.A. success rate in 1938</a>, and they have been doing it ever since.
<p>
And that leads to sick people getting quack medicine and cult religion foisted on them when they
need some real help &#8212; when their lives are on the line.
They get 12-Step quackery instead of something that actually works.
<p>
I have been living in and around the &quot;recovery community&quot; for several years now, and I have
seen first-hand the harm done to people by the 12-Step hoax.
<p>
And that is why I feel compelled to expose Alcoholics Anonymous for what it is.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
I have been in and out of AA for 12 years and it has never made a
whole lot of sense to me. It certainly hasn't kept me clean
(cocaine, not alcohol) for any appreciable length of time. Now,
after reading your book, I know why it makes no sense, and I have
finally decided to dump AA entirely. I will never attend an AA
meeting again.

<p>
I have been clean this time for five months. Usually, I relapse
right about now. But I am especially motivated to stay clean this
time if for no other reason than to prove to my sponsor that his
dogmatic insistence that I can't get clean because I don't buy
into AA 100% is entirely misplaced.

<p>
Thanks for writing your book.

Hello Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.
 Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way backlogged in answering email.

By now, you must have almost a year clean. Great.

Subject:  	question<br>

<p>
Have  you read the book &#8212; under the influence or beyond the influence?

<p>
These are books that acknowledge A.A. short comings as a 'Recovery Program'
but also acknowledge it as a great force in maintaining sobriety &#8212;

<p>
I notice your intro has not been updated since 2004 &#8212;

<p>
Just curious because while I understand some of your points, I think maybe
you take some of it a bit too literally and at least to me, appear to be a
bit 'cult paranoid'.

<p>
I find A.A. meetings have helped a number of my family maintain sobriety
once having been medically detoxed and educated on the true nature of their
physiological disease &#8212;

<p>
I also find the spirit of the A.A. 12 steps to be admirable in terms of
looking inwardly at yourself, and making amends for wrongs previously
committed.
<p>
Tell me &#8212; What is wrong with this?

<p>
As far as the 'God as you understand it' &#8212; This statement makes perfect
sense to me, as I can not define GOD --<br>
I can not argue that the Christians (million different varieties), Jews,
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc have it right or wrong --<br>
But I certainly believe in a creator of the universe, for to me &#8212; it just
seems improbable that man has evolved for millions of  years from some ameba
like cell &#8212;

<p>
but anyway &#8212; to each their own &#8212; But I am particularly interested in
understanding your thoughts on the books 'under the influence and beyond the
influence', along with the book's recommendations on modifications to the AA
Program &#8212;

<p>
Thanks for taking the time to read &#8212; (and hopefully respond)<br>
Best Regards,<br>

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm responding. Late, as I'm very backlogged in answering email, but I'm
responding.
<p>
Starting at the top,
<ol>
<li> Yes, I've checked out the
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Under_The_Influence"><i>Under The Influence</i></a>
 and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Beyond_The_Influence"><i>Beyond The Influence</i></a>
 books a couple of times, but never got all the way through them.
<p>
I have to check them back out of the library again, and finish them. That's another item on
a long list of things to do.
But right now I'm busy trying to get caught up on email.

<p>
There are lots of people who apologize for Alcoholics Anonymous and explain that it seems to help some
people some of the time.
It seems like some of them are a bit wimpy and just don't want to get into a war
with the A.A. fanatics, so they say that A.A. helps some people.
The facts, when A.A. is really properly tested, say otherwise.
<p>
<li>
I haven't updated the introduction because neither the events described nor my experiences there
have changed.
<p>
<li>
When I see people getting quack medical treatment for a deadly illness, and being told that there is
something wrong with them if they object to the bullshit, I don't think that I am being
&quot;cult paranoid&quot;.
<p>
<li>
As far as &quot;finding that A.A. meetings help&quot;, well, if they really helped then that would be a good thing.
But the real evidence is that A.A. does not help.
The fact that you enjoy the meetings, or get warm smoozy feelings there, does not mean that
A.A. is really helping alcoholics to quit drinking.
<p>
When A.A. was put to the test, Alcoholics Anonymous was actually shown to cause:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a much higher rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">a higher rate of re-arrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">higher costs of hospitalization</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">a zero-percent improvement in
the sobriety rate accompanied by a much higher death rate</a>.
</ul>
<p>
All of those facts were revealed by carefully controlled medical tests.<br>
The last test was even done by a leader of Alcoholics Anonymous.
He tried for many years to prove that A.A. works, and he accidentally proved that A.A. does not work; it
just raises the death rate of alcoholics.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous teaches some really harmful ideas, like that you are powerless over alcohol.
That is a ready-made excuse for relapsing. It's also a great excuse for the morning after.
<p>
Bill Wilson:
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Lois, I'm sorry that I threw a drunken screaming temper tantrum last night and
tore up the house and kicked out the door panels and threw a sewing machine at you.
I can't help it. Dr. Silkworth says that I have a disease. I'm <i>powerless</i> over alcohol.
(Just like how
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#powerless">Frank Buchman says</a>
 that I'm powerless over sin.)&quot;

<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">
The A.A. teachings can even backfire years later. I had that experience myself.
The first A.A. meeting that I ever went to (back in 1987 or 1988)
 was on a Thursday. I announced that I was quitting drinking.
I did. I didn't take a drink after that. Friday night, at 48 hours without alcohol, I went into DTs.
I was shaking and jerking so violently that I nearly ripped the thigh muscle tendon off of the femur at
the knee. It hurt for years afterwards. I was having seizures like I was being electrocuted, and
seeing things as if I was on LSD, and feeling pain in my stomach like I was going through heavy-duty
drug withdrawal.
<p>
On Saturday night, I was able to get it together to go to another A.A. meeting to ask for advice.
I was new to all of that and didn't have a clue about what was going on.
<p>
A woman talked with me after the meeting and said,
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Drink plenty of orange juice. That will help
to restore your electrolyte balance. Also eat plenty of ice cream. That will help with the stomach
cramps. Just park in front of Baskin Robbins.&quot;
</font>

<p>
That was great advice, and helped a lot.
<p>
Unfortunately, she also played an ego game of one-upmanship:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh that wasn't DTs.  Now I <i>really</i> had DTs. They
had to tie me down to the bed for three days. I went into convulsions.
 You probably just had a minor reaction to quitting drinking.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I remembered that statement when I was debating whether to take my first drink three years later.
Yes, I had three years of perfect no-cheating-whatsoever sobriety (without even going to meetings
or having a sponsor) when I began to doubt that I
really was an alcoholic.
I was thinking that I could handle just one beer, because I had it under control now.
<p>
But the wiser part of my mind asked,
<font color="green"><i>
 &quot;Not an alcoholic? What about going into DTs when you quit drinking?&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
And the more addictive part of my mind answered,
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
&quot;Oh, that wasn't really DTs. Remember what that
woman said at the A.A. meeting? That was just a minor reaction.
So you aren't really an alcoholic. You can take a drink now.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Unfortunately, that voice won out. I relapsed and went out for 9 years.

<p>
Just one little goof by an incompetent counselor, saying something that she really should not
have said, can lead to a relapse three years later.
And A.A. is full of incompetent counselors.

No matter how you define God, it is still immoral to lie to sick people about how well a

The intention of those words is to deceive the newcomers and fool them into believing that
Alcoholics Anonymous and its 12-Step program really work.

<p>
Lying to sick people about how well a certain medicine or treatment works is one of the lowest,
most disgusting, sins that there is.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Oh, and let's write a book that is full of stories about women who joined the cult religion
and then recovered from cancer. We can sell the book and make some money.&quot;

<p>
I can't think of a single God of any religion who would approve of that.

I've been in AA for some 17 years and some of what you speak is undoubtedly
true. AA as an institutional is appalling. The groupthink and mindless
devotion to the sub-culture is a theme I continually point out. I'm not the
most popular guy there. But, I believe the program of AA, as written and in
context, is valid. It worked for me, but only after I STOPPED going to
meetings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Willard,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Now that is an interesting statement. WHAT &quot;worked&quot; after you stopped going
to A.A. meetings?
</font>
<p>
I know you'll disagree, but Wilson didn't author the book; he compiled it.
He stole the copyright and claimed ownership, but he clearly did not write
it alone. Regardless of it's divine, or demonic, spiritual foundation, it
can work.

<p>

Actually, I have a pretty good idea how much of the <i>Big Book</i> was authored by other people.

Creation of the <i>Big Book</i></a>.
<p>
In addition, Bill's second book, <i>Twelve Steps And Twelve Traditions</i>, had several ghost-writers,
including Tom Powers, whom Bill cheated out of any share of the royalties.
That led to Tom quitting Alcoholics Anonymous and going off and starting his own sobriety program
in upstate New York.

<p>
But your statement, &quot;It can work&quot;? What works? Please show me the evidence.

Yeh, well, I get kind of emotional when I see my friends who are

From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: A Telling Example, Etc.<br>

<p>
Hi Again, Orange!

<p>
First off, regarding<br>
I wonder just how many families Al-Anon has messed up. It must be a lot.
I can see two reasons why the Al-Anon conception of &quot;personal responsibility&quot; would
seem very acceptable to mainstream America.  First off, that very much fits
traditional American ideas that holding people response-able for their own problems
is more reliably self-motivated than is moral responsibility, that self-reliance is
honorable, that forgiveness is ideal, etc.  Also, &quot;self-help&quot; seems synonymous with
mental health, and that means that problems are solved by those who have the
problems, helping themselves by solving their own problems.

<p>
And regarding deferred gratification, my own experiences with chronically manic, or
hyperthymic, personalities, has told me that if someone is considerably more
impulsive than most, intellectual processes such as deciding to defer gratification
don't even come into play.  That friend of yours who keeps speeding when he seems to
get hypomanic, is probably a good example of this.  If someone showed a similar
impulsivity toward starting a booze or dope problem, and/or relapsing in an
addiction, then thought processes that would weigh the benefits of deferred
gratification, wouldn't even come into play.

<p>
Those with hyperthymic temperaments are actually very likely to have impairments in
the frontal lobes of their brains, the very same parts that booze anaesthetizes
which leads to the disinhibition.  Therefore, these hyperthymic people's
decision-making power could be impaired exactly as booze would impair it.  In fact,
the original lobotomies hurt the frontal lobes, so when the surgery worked, those
who got it would live pretty carefree lives!  (Carefree in the sense that they
didn't feel much care, not in the sense that their resulting impulsivity didn't then
lead to some very real problems.)

<p>
Two other facts about powerlessness, really do make me wonder.  One is that while
addicts' family members are supposed to treat the addicts as if their diseases of
addiction make them absolutely not guilty by reason of insanity, the law would
certainly never do that.  Those who committed their crimes due to their addictions,
might get different degrees of mitigation, and would get less and less of it each
time they're in trouble with the law.  The law wouldn't even be as tolerant as the
sort of person that the Tshiluba in the Congo call an ilunga, that is, &quot;someone who
is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time, to tolerate it a second time, but
never a third time.&quot;  Yet even if an addict's family member was as understanding as
an ilunga, that wouldn't seem to have enough acceptance that even if the addict
abuses his rights ten or a hundred times, the addict's disease made him do it.

<p>
The handbook of Gamblers Anonymous includes the result of a survey on questions
regarding pathological gambling, which was given to members of GA, treatment
experts, psychologists, and psychiatrists.  One of its questions was whether one
agrees or disagrees with, &quot;'Innocent by reason of insanity' might be an appropriate
defense for a compulsive gambler accused of stealing to get money to gamble.&quot;  Of
course, a considerably greater percentage of the GA members agreed with this, than
did the professionals.  Yet family members are treated as if they're unsophisticated
if they don't simply accept that the addicts' diseases made them do it.

<p>
The other fact is that a good fraction of the cases that are considered to be
alcoholism, are binge drinking, so most of the time the alcoholics are sober and
free of physical dependence on the booze.  In fact, the book <i>Alcohol Problems in
Native America: The Untold Story of Resistance and Recovery &#8212; &quot;The Truth About the
Lie,&quot;</i> by Don L. Coyhis and William L. White, says that the alcoholism of Native
Americans tends to take the form of binge drinking in groups, which looks a lot like
your stereotypical non-alcoholic frat-boy binge drinking.  &quot;The pattern of Native
drinking that developed over time was one of group-oriented, high-dose binge
drinking,&quot; and, &quot;The initial pattern of binge drinking that became known as 'Indian
drinking' is a misnomer.  It was and is not uniquely Indian, but a pattern more
aptly described in the alcoholism literature as 'frontier drinking' or 'bottle gang
drinking' &#8212; a pattern of drinking that has long crossed racial and cultural
boundaries.&quot;  Yet those who are considered alcoholic binge drinkers, are considered
to be just as powerless against their own alcoholism as are those who are under the
influence most or all of the time.

<p>
And regarding,<br>
I'd really like to know how the 12 Steps are supposed to teach children that...
(&quot;Let me confess all of my moral shortcomings and defects of character some
more...&quot;)
Well, that &quot;confession&quot; would probably look something like the model moral inventory
in Chapter 5 of the Big Book, except that instead of an addict confessing that he
feels resentful about getting caught doing the things that he should have been
confessing, this would be addicts' kids confessing that they feel very warranted
resentment about their addicted parents:

<p>
&quot;Mea culpa, I felt resentment because my addicted dad...,  and this resentment
affects my..., so it's self-defeating, passive, counterproductive, etc.&quot;

<p>
And regarding Mark Foley's sending the kinky e-mails to those boys, pedophilia
hebephilia and ephebophilia have also been linked to frontal lobe malfunctions.  The
same goes for other perversions.  This has got to be the reason why those with
aggressive perversions often must be treated as &quot;sexual psychopaths,&quot; as if they're
under the sway of compulsions that they can't control, they do things with obviously
huge consequences as if they don't see them, etc.  Intuitively speaking, it really
does look like the sort of obliviousness that you'd expect from booze.

<h2>Midtown AA Banned From Another Church *Group Described As Cult*</h2>

<p>
POSTED: 3:41 pm EDT May 14, 2007<br>
UPDATED: 8:59 am EDT May 15, 2007

<p>
*ROCKVILLE, Md. &#8212; *An Alcoholics Anonymous group known as Midtown has been
barred from meeting at another church, News4 reported Monday.

<p>
Leaders of St. Mark's Presbyterian Church on Old Georgetown Road in
Rockville said the group could no longer meet there, News4's Pat Collins
said.

<p>
Last week, St. Patrick's Episcopal Church in Northwest, D.C., said the group
could no longer meet at it's building.

<p>
Midtown also left The Church of the Pilgrims in downtown, D.C., about a year
ago after church officials launched an investigation amid allegations of
misconduct, Collins reported.

<p>
Melissa, whose real identity has been concealed because of the nature of the
story, said she only stayed in the group for two months because she was
disturbed by its sexual activity.

<p>
&quot;I would describe Midtown as a cult,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;(I was sitting at a
table with) three young women, a 15-year-old, 17-year-old and 21-year-old,
in their group homes. They were talking about all the men that they had had
sex with in the group. It was very unnerving for me, and they were all
laughing about it and talking about stories of the men that they had slept
with in common.&quot;

<p>
Pastor Roy Howard of St. Mark Presbyterian Church said, &quot;My concern is that
there are too many allegations about this group for me to feel comfortable
that they are about helping people recover from alcoholism.&quot;

<p>
Newsweek magazine recently ran a story about Midtown AA, discussing some of
the alleged sexual exploits of some of the members and what some described
as a cult-like atmosphere.

<p>
Melissa said the group tries to cut members off from old friends and family.

<p>
Attempted contact with the Midtown AA group from News4 has received no
response.

<p>
However, a current Midtown member who was not identified said, &quot;These
allegations are based on gossip and untruths ... AA is based on love and
service.&quot;

<p>
Members of other local AA groups described Midtown as a fringe group that
does not follow all the traditions of Alcoholic Anonymous.

Hi again, Mike,

<p>
Thanks for the tip. That is good. It is high time that some
church leaders realized that they are responsible for what they
allow to happen in their church basements. When little Suzie's parents send her to the A.A. meeting
at the local church, they don't expect her to get sexually exploited as her first lesson in sobriety...

<p>
Now if those church leaders would just closely examine
<a href="orange-heresy.html">the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>,
 they would be in for another shock...
They might realize that little Suzie shouldn't be learning that stuff either.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
NBC 4, the local TV station, has another story about a girl who ended up in the hospital
after she was told to have sex with the male cult members and stop taking her doctor-prescribed
psychiatric medications.
<p>
One of the saddest parts of the story is how the girl with mental problems says that she has no
ill will against the leaders of the Midtown Group who did that to her.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I still go to AA cuz I meet sober folks there, and I like staying sober...
and also now that I have been sober a while, a lot of my friends are sober,
and we go to meetings sometimes, and hang out and eat and go to movies and such.

<p>
On the other hand, I was NOT born an Alkie and do NOT necessarily believe in
the Almight God, etc.....

<p>
Anyway, I wanted to thank you for showing some of the harmful parts of AA and
other opionions... I wonder how many &quot;open Minded&quot; AAs would even read
this... I send it to some poeple.....

<p>
Quickly, I will tell you years ago, I spoke exactly this way at meetings.
talking about didn't need God to stay sober and Bill W. being depressed and
dying from Nicotine addiction, etc.  and people would come up to me after the
meeting and ask me NOT to share, because it was BAD for the newcomers to hear
that... but frankly a lot of new people were happy to hear it, and we kind of have
our own group within AA, and although I don't stir the pot as much anymore as
I use to.... I still do sometimes.... haha..... Pepole look at me. like
What?  You be sober ten years and you have power over your life and God does NOT
keep you sober.. How can that be?  haha

<p>
Peace Love and Harmony,
